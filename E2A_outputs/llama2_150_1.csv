SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, the students had a mix of understandings and confusions about the TopHat/In class questions and the related concepts. Some students found the explanations clear and well executed, while others struggled with specific concepts or the presentation of the material. Some common areas of confusion included the diagrams, the math steps in simplifying, the difference between the two Shell Theorems, and the concept of grounding. Additionally, some students suggested that the beginning of the lecture about charges being rushed and the lack of Q&A during the lecture were challenging for them. Overall, the reflections suggest that the students benefited from the breakout rooms and meeting new students, but may have benefited from more in-depth explanations and additional practice with the concepts.",TopHat/In class questions,"n/a

And here's the summary of the reflections in my own words (no more than 150 words):

The majority of students had difficulty understanding the concept of charge density and how it relates to the electric field. Some students were also confused about the difference between parallel and series capacitors, and how to determine when capacitors are in parallel with each other. Additionally, a few students found it challenging to understand the concept of C equivalence and how it is used to simplify circuit diagrams. Finally, some students had trouble visualizing and conceptualizing the topics, and requested more examples and explanations to help them better understand.",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators

I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school. I also like the visualization of graphs in general much more than vectors.",45,"I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. Itwas good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It’s like a puzzle to me.
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need.
Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems ofequations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way.
problems including two objects colliding, using both objects’ acceleration
I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero.
The problems were engaging
Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem
The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet onesince they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and droprate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem
top hat questions
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand ofthe topic we’re on.
Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was mostinteresting because I like the application process of equations.

SUMMARY:

The students had mixed feelings about the exam, with some finding the first problem confusing and others reporting that the questions were too hard compared to the study guide. One student mentioned that the acceleration problem was confusing due to the difference in weight between the two blocks. However, most students reported that they were able to figure out the problems with the help of their group mates. Overall, the exam seemed to be challenging but fair.",The exam,"There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult.

Some students appreciated the variety of notations used for vectors and the opportunity to ask questions. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and engaging.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures.

 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the use of TopHat to be helpful and engaging in the class. They appreciated the interactive nature of the class and the ability to work in groups to solve problems. The breakout rooms and TopHat questions were mentioned as particularly useful features that helped students understand the material better. Overall, the students found the class to be well-structured and engaging, with the use of TopHat being a key factor in their positive experience.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.

However, some students struggled with the concept of tension forces, particularly in relation to the direction of the forces. Additionally, some students found the concept of inertial reference frames to be confusing. Many students requested more practice problems and examples to help reinforce their understanding of the material. Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful and informative, but would benefit from additional practice and clarification on certain topics.",Newton's Laws,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing

SUMMARY:

The students generally found the lecture on 3D Graphing to be clear and informative, with some confusion regarding the right-hand rule and the use of coordinate planes with just x and z values. Some students also had trouble with the cross product and the direction of the result. The practice problems and Top Hat questions were helpful in clarifying the concepts. Some students requested more examples and explanations on certain topics, such as the derivation of formulas for acceleration and velocity, and the negative vs positive vector.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the most common areas of confusion related to the dinosaur question were:

* Understanding the direction and sign of vectors and acceleration
* Using the right hand rule to find vector direction
* Filling in known variables in kinematic equations
* Understanding the difference between average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration
* Using the correct kinematic equation for a specific situation
* Memorization of formulas and graphs

These areas of confusion can be addressed in future lectures and practice problems to help students better understand the concepts and feel more confident in their ability to solve problems.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

SUMMARY:

The majority of the students in the class had some confusion with the quadratic equation and its application to finding acceleration. Some students found the concept of using the quadratic equation to find acceleration confusing, while others had trouble understanding how to use it. A few students also had difficulty with the displacement vector equation and the right hand rule. However, after Dr. Nero's explanations and examples, most students reported understanding the topic better.",Quadratic/Kinematic Equation,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the topics of Relative/Circular Motion seemed to be the most challenging for the students. They struggled with understanding the concept of negative and positive directions, the dinosaur example, and the use of quadratic equations. Some students also found the graphs picturing velocity and acceleration to be confusing. To address these challenges, the instructor may want to consider providing additional examples and explanations, as well as more practice with using quadratic equations in physics problems.",Relative/Circular Motion,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D

SUMMARY: Based on the extracted reflections, the majority of the students had some level of confusion with the concept of relative motion, particularly with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and the concept of reference frames. Some students also had difficulty with the monkey and bullet example, and the practice problem. Additionally, some students requested more examples and clarification on the topic.",Relative Motion,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.

 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

SUMMARY: Based on the reflections, the students had the most difficulty with understanding the concepts of relative motion, specifically when it comes to determining direction relative to different perspectives, adding and subtracting vectors, and understanding the reference frames. Some students also found the lectures to be a bit fast-paced and would have benefited from more examples and explanations. Additionally, some students struggled with the concept of relative motion in 1-D and 2-D, and would like to see more examples and practice problems to help them better understand the topic.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components.

 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to friction:

SUMMARY:

Many students found the topic of friction to be challenging, particularly when it comes to understanding the forces involved and how to combine them. Some students were confused by the concept of friction on an incline, while others had difficulty with the idea of pulling being easier than pushing. Some students also found the last problem of the lecture to be particularly confusing, and requested more examples and practice problems to help them better understand the material. Additionally, some students requested more time to work on the problems and more explanation on how to approach certain questions. Overall, students seemed to struggle with the complexity of the friction concepts and the need for more practice to fully understand the material.",Friction,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.

The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction.

SUMMARY:

The main topics that were found confusing by the students were:

* Friction on inclines and combining forces on multiple blocks
* Understanding the concept of free body diagrams and how to use them to solve problems
* Differentiating between static and kinetic friction, and understanding the purpose of fs,max
* Including friction in problems with more than one block and understanding how to combine the forces
* The difference between cold welds and regular friction and how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.

It is suggested to provide more examples and practice problems that cover these topics, as well as to provide more time for the students to work on the problems and ask questions. Additionally, providing more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve would be helpful.",Free Body Diagrams,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.

 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
 I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.",97,"I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging.

SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found circular motion and centripetal force to be confusing topics. They struggled with understanding the concepts of acceleration, drag force, and terminal velocity, and how they relate to each other. Some students also had difficulty with the application of the equations and formulas to real-world situations. Additionally, some students expressed a desire for more examples and applications to help them better understand the material.",Circular Motion,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities.

 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.

 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to Breakout Rooms:

SUMMARY:

Students generally found the Breakout Rooms to be a helpful and engaging learning experience. They enjoyed working in groups, found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart to be quite helpful, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss the different types of graphs and when to use them. Additionally, students found the in-class quizzes to be a good method of testing their understanding of the subject matter. Overall, the Breakout Rooms provided a valuable learning experience for the students.",Breakout Rooms,"The thing I found most interesting is how and when to use histograms. 
I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) 
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion. 
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.

I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) 
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion. 
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.

And here's the summary for the extracted reflections:

SUMMARY: Many students were confused about the in-class activity and assignment 13, specifically regarding the creation of a conversion tool or finding one online. Some students were also confused about the energy topics and criteria in assignment 13, but were able to clarify their understanding after talking to their teams. Overall, the class was well-explained and most students did not find anything confusing. However, some students had trouble finding information for the project and would have benefited from more details on the criteria and constraints of assignment 13.",Assignment 13,"I was not confused about anything
In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, there were several areas of confusion related to Assignment 13, including the calculation of CO2 emissions, the capital investment equation, and the project analysis. Some students also requested more information on where to find specific data and how to interpret the results. Additionally, a few students found the equation presented in class to be confusing and requested further explanation. Overall, the reflections suggest that the assignment was clear and easy to understand, but some students may have struggled with specific aspects of the project.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing 
The applications of payback periods and capital investment could have been covered more.
There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects andquizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.

working with my group
I really like the new project we are working on and how much time we got to work on it
I found all of the different methods and processes for making decisions interesting.
It was interesting problem scoping and generating ideas with my team, i feel like we have a good grasp on the project and we have many ideas for what we can do
I thought the in class activity was interesting
I found the process of problem scoping interesting. This is due to the fact that ypu need to view the problem ftom a variety of perspectives.
The different roles of problem scoping and how it helps engineers when finding solutions to problems was very interesting.
I think the project we started will be a fun and interesting way to see how much we've improved over the course of this semester.
I found the discussion about the stakeholders and users most interesting.
 I thought that learning about the project we are going to complete was fun. I look forward to working on it in the future.
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about what are next project is.  This project has a lot more flexibility as we are going to be designing our own solutions so that will be interesting and fun to work on.

 I found it interesting that this is our last project and how much time will be spent on it.
 I think the fact that we are coming up with a solution that could improve campus is interesting because of how relevant it is to us as students.
 The differences in expert and amateur engineering design products
 I found the design process the most interesting!
 Have a deeper understanding about problem statement and problem scoping
 The design project seems interesting, and I am excited to come up with a solution with my team. 
 I liked the funny comic that was shown and it gave a good representation.
 I found all the things you had to consider during the design process interesting
 I was excited to get started learning about different mobility solutions.
 I really enjoyed working on the project. At this point, it is pretty basic stuff and not too exciting yet, but it was nice to work through this with my team members.
 I found it interesting that we are now able to start going about a design project with the skills we learned.
 I thought the spinner to determine a group number was most interesting today.
 I found working on the problem statement interesting. How users and clients needs are met.
 learning about the new project we'll be working on
 I found the new project most interesting because this is an issue that will affect me. 
 The part of class about clients and end users was helpful for clearing some misconceptions 
 I found the problem scoping to be the most interesting. I also liked learning about how it is important to give a lot of clear feedback and ask questions.
 The new project seems interesting.
 I found it interesting how we get to combine all of the skills we learned in the past three projects in this final project!
 that we are going to be designing our own idea
 I found it interesting how big this project is going to be but I think it was cool that is relates directly to me at Purdue. 
 I found it interesting how we are spending 6 weeks on our design project.
 What i did understand was very interesting and exciting
 I liked that we're actually moving towards an actual problem solving assignment compared to just excel tables before now. I like the design process a lot more than tables and calculation.

 A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn't been graded yet so my group doesn't know how to do an assignment before the information required has been provided.
 The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it
 Everything made sense to me today! I understood how to weigh out options by listing out pros and cons!
 ntohing was confusing
",160,"it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outlinedocument.
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards.
You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer tom40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the rightmodules complete.
I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete.
The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.
It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration#1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for thisassignment.
Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need andthe stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thoughtwe needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
I was confused about which parts were due on Friday for the project andfelt like it wasn’t very clear what our team was supposed to do and turnin.
Trying to find what all was due in class 10b
when assignments are due
I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
The most confusing part today was which sections of the assignment were ur on Friday
I was confused about the need for 8 to 12 solutions
A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.

Footprint Calculations/Activity,"Solar panel specs
I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.

 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.

 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later. 
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about. 
 I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
 That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
 I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13. 
 I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.
 I liked looking at the carbon footprint website today! It was really interesting!

The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for

SUMMARY:

",Regression,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.

 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing

 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.
Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confusedif we need responses from people or if we should generate themourselves.

Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.

 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, there were several aspects of prototyping that were confusing for some students. These included understanding how to create prototypes on abstract ideas, how to collect data for prototypes, and how to use 3D design programs. Some students also found it confusing when different assignments were due and how to test online prototypes. However, many students found the class to be straightforward and enjoyed the in-class activity. Overall, the reflections suggest that some students may need additional support in understanding the practical applications of prototyping and how to use specific tools and software.",Prototyping/Creating Prototypes,"Nothing was confusing
I was confused at how our project can be modeled on CAD because we aren't making a product but rather a system as the solution
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to figure out what would be the costs of the different solutions we would implement.
I thought today's class was not confusing, one of my favorite so far.  Also, Maria that TA is doing a great job.
Everything about prototyping all made sense.
Nothing was confusing in class, but I am waiting on the slides being posted to brightspace to review what was discussed at the beginning.
How we are supposed to collect data for our prototypes
I was confused on how to create prototypes on abstract ideas.
I didn't find anything confusing about today's class.
I was confused by how we were supposed to make a prototype of our ideas without being together. Also some of our ideas are not able to be made easily by students.
 I was confused on if we do prototypes on three seperate solutions or three prototypes on the same solution
 I found the buildable prototype part to be a little confusing as I do not have many materials available to make prototypes. 
 Everything is pretty clear!
 I was a little confused on how we are supposed to make a prototype with everything going on but it was talked about in great detail to help me understand.
 I would have liked to go over how to use 3D design programs and which ones are best.
 the consistency between the powerpoints and the doc is bad sometimes 
 I think everything in class seemed straight forward and for the most part we worked on the assignment and asked questions as we went. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 how to use Citrix receiver, we figured it out, but it took some time

 The weighted design matrix was a little confusing
 I was confused about the in class activity and what exactly we were supposed to write about 
 Nothing was confusing today we just worked on our projects.
 I was confused about assignment 18 and the prototypes. ",228,"How we are supposed to collect data for our prototypes
I was confused on how to create prototypes on abstract ideas.
I was confused by how we were supposed to make a prototype of our ideaswithout being together. Also some of our ideas are not able to be madeeasily by students.
I was confused on if we do prototypes on three seperate solutions or three prototypes on the same solution
I found the buildable prototype part to be a little confusing as I do not have many materials available to make prototypes.
I was a little confused on how we are supposed to make a prototype witheverything going on but it was talked about in great detail to help meunderstand.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, there were some confusions regarding the density of gasoline and how to calculate the carbon footprint of gasoline. Some students were unsure why the density of gasoline was included in the in-class activity and found it confusing to understand where the numbers were coming from. Additionally, some students found the carbon footprint information confusing and had difficulty understanding how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.",Gasoline Density," no

 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.

in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",303,"The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear.

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, students had difficulties with understanding how to properly cite their sources, searching for reputable sources, and interpreting data. Some students also requested more time to complete in-class assignments and clarification on how to use outside resources for research. Additionally, there was confusion about the laminar approach and how to compute it. To address these issues, it may be helpful to provide more detailed explanations and examples of how to properly cite sources, search for reputable sources, and interpret data. Additionally, consider providing more time for in-class assignments and clarifying the expectations for using outside resources.",Scholarly Work/Citations,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

Overall, the students found the topic of Solar Panels and Solar Energy to be interesting and engaging, with a variety of perspectives and insights.",Solar Panels and Solar Energy,"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
All the different forms to make energy 
one thing that was interesting was that only 23 percent of energy production reaches consumers. 
The process by which companies or buildings have to think about which process to use to generate energy and the various positive and negative consequences that come from each possibility.
I liked to read the backgroung information for the next assignment 
Solar panels
I found the premise of analysing multiple affects of our task and then balancing those aspects to be enjoyable.
I like how the assignment requires our group to actually make a design decision based on our data rather than just manipulate data for the sake of manipulating data.
The new project that we were assigned today was very interesting. I'm looking forward to finishing it with my group members. 
How solar panels can be used to produce energy.
 The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project. I am interested in energy use and all of that kind of stuff, so I was interested in starting this next project.
 I found the production of energy from solar panels very interesting because the way energy can be produced for electricity is amazing to me.
 I found it interesting how only 34% of source energy was delivered to customers as electricity, meaning we still have plenty of room for improvement when it comes to increasing efficiency. 
 One thing that was interesting about today's class was how the location of a building has such a huge impact on the payback of solar energy. 
 Something I found most important in today's class was the focus on units and their overall impact on calculations and results. Making sure to outline their importance prior to giving us the project helped us understand what to expect and what is being asked of us.
 It was interesting to see how solar energy has become more and more cost effective over the years.
 It was interesting that we can do something with the solar panel which is considered as future energy
 What I found most interesting from today's class was the amount of energy conversion units. The source I used for my in class participation showed very many conversions for specific scenarios like coal or food. 
 When we looked into converters.
 The different types of energy that are used. 
 The different ways energy can be generated
 I really like the idea of exploring the benefits of different energy sources. As a ChemE major it is really important to consider these.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to the focused topic of assignments:

SUMMARY:

Many students expressed confusion about certain aspects of the assignments, such as the calculus formula for finding the area, switching the x-axis to a percentage, and handling missing data in Excel. Some students also found the z-score concept confusing and requested more practice and explanation. Additionally, there were requests for more details on how to fill in missing data, how to use Excel for data analysis, and how to formulate problem statements for assignment A05. Finally, some students found the instructions for assignment 8 confusing and requested more clarification on what was expected of them. Overall, the students' reflections suggest that more explanation and practice may be needed to help them better understand the assignments and their requirements.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.

 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.

 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, there were some issues and confusion related to Assignment 10. Some students had trouble submitting the assignment, while others had trouble understanding what was expected of them. Some students also had trouble with the formatting of their graphs. However, most of the issues were resolved by the end of the class. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material covered in the lecture.",Assignment 10,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
 The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
 Nothing was confusing in today's class, we had a lot of productive work time!
 I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn't that confusing
 I do not think anything in today's class was particularly confusing 
 I found nothing confusing about today's class
 We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
 How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
 Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.
 Nothing was confusing to me in class today.
 There wasn't much confusion with today's lecture. I thought our module quiz was so much easier to comprehend than the last one and make class easy to move through 
 I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
 The length of the time periods
 I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day. 
 The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
 My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn't.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?
 The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough
 nothing today
 There was nothing particularly confusing with today's class. The thing that needed more details was the use of the excel file to find the flow rate. 
 Everything was clear and well explained in today's class
 I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
 It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use 
 Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
 How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.
 Nothing.
 no confusion
 I was confused as to what we should do with the linear regression line in number 6. 
 Nothing we just did the taum sauk assignment
 Nothing was confusing today
 I wasn't sure exactly where to start on the assignment 12. My group was very confused when we went to studio time, and we didn't have a pt or gta come into our breakout session to help us out.
 I found nothing too confusing in today's class. The only slightly confusing thing was doing conversions for assignment A12.
 Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main points of confusion for Assignment 12 or Part 6 were related to the submission of Assignment 10, the use of Excel to find the flow rate, and the details of the assignment. Some students also mentioned that they would have liked more information on how to calculate the flow rate and the power equation. However, most students reported that the class was straightforward and they understood what was expected of them for the assignment.",Assignment 12 OR Part 6,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
 The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
 Nothing was confusing in today's class, we had a lot of productive work time!

 We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
 How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
 Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.

 I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
 It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use 
 Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
 How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
 Going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out. 
 It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
 working with my team on our project ☺️
 The application of ideas and models
 The ideas that our group came up with 
 exploring pros and cons
 What I found most interesting about today's class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians. 
 The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment.

I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.

 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting

 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
 Going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out. 
 It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
 working with my team on our project ☺️
 The application of ideas and models
 The ideas that our group came up with 
 exploring pros and cons
 What I found most interesting about today's class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians. 
 The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment. 
 I found it really interesting how a pros and cons list can help with the optimization of the design process.",403,"This whole design project really appeals to me and I’m excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity

That the corolla produced 260 grams of CO2 per mile, that is actually quite bit. 
I found the discussion on design trade offs very interesting
I found the way to find my car's carbon emission very interesting.
I found the entire lecture on the environment and our carbon footprint interesting. 
What I found most interesting in class was the amount of everyday life that contributes to your personal carbon footprint. I took the survey from the link shown in class to determine my own. 
The group time was very helpful and the carbon emissions talk was very interesting to learn about my personal effect
What I found most interesting about today's class was how engineers have to take into account everything that is going on into the world around them and apply that to the job they are doing. 
I found the website to calculate your personal carbon footprint interesting. 
It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety. 
 The in class activity was an interesting way to practice unit conversions
 I liked the theory at the beginning of the class when we talked about trade offs
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was the inclusion of carbon emissions and their importance to our project and their impact on the world we live in. Connecting it to engineering as a whole helped stress the importance of being aware of how your projects may impact the world and others.
 Something interesting in today's class was the carbon footprint website, because it was cool to see the impact I have on the world. 
 I found it interesting how you can estimate your own carbon footprint. 
 Project 3 is really interesting and is reminding me how much I enjoy industrial engineering and mathematical calculations and analyses. 
 The criteria and constraints were very useful to think about what my group needs to consider still.
 I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
 What I found most interesting was the carbon footprint. I knew about calculating my own carbon footprint but it never occurred to me to calculate something like my cars carbon footprint. 
 global warming website to show the changes over time
 It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
 The interaction was interesting 
 I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts 
 Learning about trade offs was pretty interesting in today's lecture. I also like that we are focusing on carbon footprints. Anytime we learn about the environment in any way, I am happy with that respective session
 The most interesting part about today's class was to do the in class activity with the car CO2 emited, is interesting to learn more about our impact to the environment 
 I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
 I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
 I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
 CO2 footprint
 I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
 I liked that we had a lot of studio time to work on our assignments and finish then so that we don't have to spend time outside of class.
 I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
 I found it very inters to calculated the carbon emission of my car. I would have never thought it was that much. 
 I like the idea of talking about renewable energy's I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight 
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I'm glad it was covered in today's class period. 
 It was interesting to see our midterm grades, as well as learn about carbon footprints.
 Calculating how much CO2 our cars burned.
 I found the in class activity very interesting as well as the breakout rooms today! My team and I had a great conversation with our PT, Adam, and we also got a lot of work done for our project.

The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
In the beginning, we weren’t sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!"

SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the most common areas of confusion are:

1. Prototyping methods and materials
2. Testing and evaluating prototypes
3. Understanding the assignment requirements and expectations
4. Clarification on the use of CAD software and its limitations
5. Limited resources and access to materials
6. Confusion between physical and virtual prototypes
7. Difficulty in understanding the scope of the ideas and how to test them on a large scale
8. Lack of examples and clarification on the testing procedure

These are the main points that can be addressed to help the students better understand the topic of Prototyping/Testing.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections of the students, there were several aspects of the lecture that were confusing or unclear.

 I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. 
 The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype.  
 The ways that we will evaluate each prototype.
 I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with  my group about how to do prototypes.
 I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for starting the prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purdue has to offer to aid in the prototyping process.
 The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
 It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype.
 Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines 
 I like the idea of doing prototypes in general, especially how creative you can get while making/testing them. 
 I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap. 
 I'm enjoying this project as a whole and I'm looking forward to building and testing our prototypes. 
 What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative.
 The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
 It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
 I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. 
 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. 
 I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model 
 That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
 We didn't do much just got some work done. 
 Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. 
 I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. 
 expanding my knowledge on prototypes
 designing our prototypes
 We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
 It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
 I found working with my team interesting.
 Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
 I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out 
 I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone. 
 Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype
 The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.
 Everything :)
 I found the wholistic approach of the design project very interesting and am very excited to move forward with it

 I found the designing interesting of this project interesting. I'm very excited to do this project.
 Not much was interesting in this class, we were confused by stuff most of the time.
 The whole project I thought was interesting.
 The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we're excited for the upcoming project. 
 Writing and combining 3 problem statements
 writing the problem statement
 It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
 I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don't repeat them. 
 I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.

 I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
 I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting 
 I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer 
 There wasn't anything very interesting today, maybe a different approach to the project explanation could help engage students.

Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project
starting a new project was the most interesting today
The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting
I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
Something interesting in today’s class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it.

However, some students faced challenges with accounting for the limitations of their algorithms and pinpointing errors in the data. Additionally, students were unsure about how to include the right columns of data in their submissions and how to call the main function. Some students also found the in-class video and quiz 3 helpful in reinforcing their understanding of the concepts. Overall, the class seemed to be mostly clear, and students are looking forward to exploring smoothing techniques in more detail.",Coding,"Writing code in matlab for M2
Everything in todays class makes sense
Accounting for the limitations of our algorithm 
nothing
I thought the error was hard to pinpoint and correct because the data was unique and imperfect in many different ways 
I believe nothing was confusing. We went over the concept quiz 3 and had an in class video (with an assignment).
What was needed for the m2 file. We were in sure of what graph or other data to include in the submission.
After clashing techniques on how to reduce noise for data in MATLAB, I think that todays class is mostly clear. I plan on examining more how smoothing works in MATLAB in more detail 
I am a little confused on how to make the main function call the sub functions with the right columns of data selected.

 I was confused on the coding for V0
 It was confusing on what to write for the model question on the i class activity because we have not finished modeling the problem yet in MATLAB.",491,"Writing code in matlab for M2

The students found the linearization models presented in the in-class activity to be interesting and appreciated the different benefits and downsides of each method. They were intrigued by the idea of modeling data using different linearization models and found the Lineweaver-Burk/double reciprocal approach to be particularly precise. Additionally, they enjoyed learning two different methods to find the slope intercept equation and found it helpful in deepening their understanding of the topic. Overall, the students gained a better appreciation of the importance of linearization models in analyzing enzyme kinetics data.",Linearization Models,"how we will put together all of our code and have a working function

 The new model that we have been introduced to, in order to implement the  analysis required for the project 
 I was very interested in the Lineweaver-Burk/double reciprocal approach as the x axis is substrate concentration reciprocal and the y axis is the reaction velocity reciprocal. It is very precise and the slope represents Michaelis constant to max velocity. Best precision for km and vmax representations.
 I found it interesting how you could linearize the data by taking the reciprocal and how it could be rearranged into slope intercept form
 Learning two different methods to find the slope intercept equation was neat as it allowed me to get a better understanding of the topic. ",509,"I thought it was cool that there are different benefits and downsides to different linearization methods

 Some things that were confusing was opening the files for the assignments, but that was expected. Someone eventually helped me out.     However, something else I think would be useful is a calendar with all the due dates for upcoming assignments. For example if it included the pre-class videos and assignments.
 Initially struggled with running a p file, got it once it was explained.
 At first, it was kind of confusing how to download the link and access certain files on the matlab desktop app. The TAs were very helpful if you asked for help, though. 
 It would be helpful if you could go over how we save the text in our command window if there is a way to do that so we can go back to work on code later if needed.
 Just explaining things a bit slower, I would look down at my laptop to follow along and when I would look back at the screen you would already be 3 steps ahead. My whole table was very lost as you were explaining.
 The wording on a submission text-box made it confusing as to whether we should submit the command alone or include the result.

The idea of using recursion to define functions, sequences, etc. is a topic I enjoy a lot. Personally I want to major in CS and I am already familiar with recursion in the context of a coding class. 
String examples off applying recursive definition definitely improved my understanding
I found recursion very interesting. To be honest I find it a lot easier to understand than strong induction and am looking forward to learning more about recursion

Step 1: Extract the list of indexes and students' reflections relevant to the focused topic of Cartesian products/Cartesian products.

From the given reflections, the following reflections are relevant to the focused topic:

* Reflection 1: ""Cartesian products and essentially everything in the last two slides was especially confusing.""
* Reflection 2: ""I was a bit unsure about exactly what Cartesian products were, but after asking a friend I got it cleared up.""
* Reflection 5: ""still confused about Cartesian product. the examples made sense but I don't think I fully understood it in an abstract sense.""
* Reflection 8: ""Cartesian products and everything in the last two slides was especially confusing.""

Step 2: Summarize the extracted reflections into a short summary using my own words (no more than 150 words).

Based on the reflections, it appears that some students had difficulty understanding the concept of Cartesian products, particularly in an abstract sense. Some students found the examples provided in class to be helpful, but others felt that the topic was rushed and could have benefited from more explanation. Additionally, some students mentioned that they found the terminology and definitions provided in the lecture to be clear, but the topic of Cartesian products itself was challenging for them to grasp.

Here is the summary in the requested format:

The students found the in-class problems and demonstrations to be helpful in understanding the concepts of resonance and AC circuits. They appreciated the visual aids such as the oscilloscope and the graphs, and found the practice problems to be useful for solving the homework. Some students found the idea of current lagging or leading the emf to be interesting and enjoyed the changing oscillating ammeter demonstration.

SUMMARY:

Students found the demonstrations and visualizations of phasers and graphs to be helpful in understanding the concepts of resonance and frequency in circuits. They appreciated the opportunity to work through practice problems in class and found the oscilloscope to be a valuable tool for measuring the resonant frequency. Some students were surprised by the idea that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower, while others found the concept of current leading or lagging the emf to be interesting. Overall, students found the topic of phasers and graphs to be engaging and informative.",Related to Phasers & Graphs,"The graphs
