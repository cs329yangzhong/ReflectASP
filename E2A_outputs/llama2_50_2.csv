Many students struggled with understanding the concept of potential energy and how to apply it to electric fields. They found it difficult to set up the problems, take partial derivatives, and understand when to use the integral to find work. Some students also had trouble with the second concept question on conductors and the potential energy of the field.

Many students struggled with the problem set up in the lecture, particularly with the initial setup and the limits of integration. Some students found the concepts from Calculus needed review before applying them to Physics. Determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge and drawing dE vectors along the z-axis were also confusing for some students. Additionally, some students were confused about the example that was covered in class and had trouble with the sanity checks.",Problem Set up,"the integrations were confusing but i think i just need to focus more and review calc
The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration. 
Some of the Calc concepts needed some review before I could fully apply them to Physics.
Determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge. Also drawing dE vectors along the z-axis was a bit confusing for me.
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question.
Ring of charge calculations
The class problem regarding finding the x component of Electric field.
I was confused about the example that we went over because of the perpendicular and parallel forces. I think that part through me off so I think doing more examples would be helpful for me. 
Ring of charge and the symmetry cancellation 
I am confused on how to figure out what dq should be in example problems that use that equation 
 I am somewhat confused on what dq/ds represent in the problems in parts 3/4 of this lecture series.
 I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge. 
 While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge. 
 The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me
 I was a little confused where L+d came from in the linear charge integral.  
 The limits on the integrals confused me the most. I did not know why some of them changed midway through the problem. 
 How to determine the setup for the charges. The integration isn't difficult it is more the choosing what to use. Also I am a bit unclear when it comes to the sanity checks. 
 I was confused about recognizing which variable you should take the the integral with respect to (depending on the problem)
 The second question on the concept quiz gave me issues and made me pretty confused, especially when it came to setting up the integral. 
 Water droplet problem is what I had the most trouble with.
 The practice problem where we were given the dipole dipole moment and had to find kinetic energy was quite challenging for me. If we could do another example like that, that would be great!
 The dipole questions were really confusing for me today. 
 The thing that was most confusing was problem the problem we did in the breakout rooms. The first problem we did stumped me",14,"The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.

Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.

 I'd say power was the most confusing part. 
 Relating delta V=emf to delta V=IR
 I found it confusing how and what resistors actually do.  I find it confusing because I am doing calculations and finding numbers but don't know what they do. 
 More examples and discussion of differences between conductors, semiconductors etc 
 I was confused about how you can tell when resistors are in parallel/series
 It wasn't confusing, but I think going over Ohm's law and when you can and can't use it would be helpful 
 the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage. ",34,"I was a little confused about the last example in lecture for finding the voltage in each resistor because I wasn’t sure how the amps split in the circuit
I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.

SUMMARY:

The students had some confusion regarding the topics of current density, charge distribution on capacitors in series and parallel, and the concept of C equivalence. Some students also found it difficult to understand the examples and explanations provided in the lecture. Additionally, there was a question about the formula used for parallel capacitance and series capacitance on the concept quiz.",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators
 The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.

""Students struggled with understanding the physical properties of the electric field and how it relates to electric force, as well as calculating moments for dipoles in non-uniform fields. Some found the concept of simple charge distributions and the binomial theorem confusing. Additionally, students requested more time to absorb the information and examples in the lecture.""",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on.

[8",Monkey Problem,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
 The monkey experiment is interesting.
 The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
 The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
 The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
 Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
 The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool. 
 I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
 I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.

 I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
 The group questions
 The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch. 
 I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
 The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
 The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
 understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
 Monkey problem.
 falling monkey
 I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems. 
 Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
 The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole 
 The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating. 
 I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
 projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant 
 The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent. 
 The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
 I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other. 
 projectile motion and falling monkey
 I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about. 
 The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
 The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
 The FBD drawings 
 I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the interactive and hands-on approach to learning vector addition to be helpful and engaging. They appreciated the use of breakout rooms and top hat questions to practice and apply the concepts. Additionally, many students found the visual aids, such as triangles, to be helpful in understanding the material. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and enjoyable.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.

 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the class format was well-received and effective in engaging students. Students appreciated the interactive and collaborative aspects of the class, such as breakout rooms and top hat questions, and found the use of examples and real-world applications helpful in understanding the material. The opportunity to work in groups and the variety of question types used in the class were also appreciated. Overall, the class format was effective in keeping students engaged and motivated.",Class Format,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

56,"  Sure! Here's the summary of the student reflections related to the Man and Pulley Example:

Extracted Related Reflections: [ (1, ""The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing""), (2, ""I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley""), (3, ""I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing""), (4, ""I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice""), (5, ""The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did""), (6, ""I found the reasoning behind the man lifting himself with w/2 to be confusing"") ]

SUMMARY:
The students found the Man and Pulley Example challenging, with confusion arising from the concept of two tension forces, the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley, and the reasoning behind the man lifting himself with w/2. Some students also had trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, and found the question with tension to be confusing.",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension

The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
How you could put more than one object in a system 
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
 I was confused about the free body diagrams. 
 The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
 The part that was confusing about today's lecture was the problem with the three blocks. I didn't know how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram for that.
 Some of the free body diagrams, such as the one with the ice blocks, still are not clear to me
 pulleys
 I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times.  This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
 doubling the force of tension 
 I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from. 
 I'm a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable 
 Double tension on a pulley and the principles behind it occurring
 The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing
 How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing. 
 How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got. 
 Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope
 The forces being internalized
 Forces between blocks
 Something that was confusing was the force between two blocks pushed together. 
 I found the last one clicker question confusing with how to define the system.
 I found the reasoning behind the man lifting himself with w/2 to be confusing

SUMMARY:

The students found the topics of cold and hot welds to be interesting and appreciated the explanation of how they impact friction. They also enjoyed the conceptual questions and the ability to apply the coefficients of friction to real-life scenarios. Some students were surprised by the answers to certain questions and found the topic of friction to be memorable. Overall, the students found the lecture to be engaging and informative.",Cold and Hot Welds,"I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level. 
While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren't too hard but not too easy as well. 
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.
Surprised by the answer to the second question, I thought the lower block was just put in to confuse us
Calculating the coefficient of friction for sandpaper 
I found that learning how to set up the system and what masses are included is important to solving friction problems
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
 Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
 It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction. 
 The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
 I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we've been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting. 
 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
 Break out room discussions
 I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style. 
 the concept of static friction changing with the force against it
 I enjoyed applying the coefficients of friction to a box on a slope.
 I really enjoyed the conceptual TopHat questions. I feel like they help me in application problems later in lecture and in the homework.
 i found the exapmle of solving for friction of the sand paper block interesting 
 Free body diagrams of systems 
 How pulling is more efficient than pushing
 The problem about pushing or pulling a sled, in particular how the angle you push an object changes the force you need to move it
 What I found most interesting in today's lecture was the conceptual questions. The sled question tricked me a little so it was interesting to see what the answer was and why.
 Use of multiple free body diagrams in one problem
 That it is easier to prevent an object from moving than to slow it down with friction
 I thought that learning that surface area didn't really contribute to the force of friction was interesting
 I like the question with the two blocks where one was pushed on top of the other.
 I found the his explanation with the force of friction interesting
 I thought the fact that more SA being on a surface not creating for static friction was interesting
 I found the fact that you can find the coefficient of friction by simply knowing theta. 
 i was interested by the idea that pulling is easier than pushing and the math behind it
 Top hat question 
 I found the group questions most interesting since they required both calculation and some conceptual knowledge on our part.
 I found it interesting how surface area is not included in the friction equation. 
 Using two equations to find the static of friction coefficient was similar to tension problems 
 The sandpaper block on the sandpaper ramp
 Is coefficient of friction dependent on anything besides materials?
 I enjoyed how I could easily visualize what I learned using my experience from everyday life. 
 the cold welds, Fn on the atomic level
 The most interesting thing I'd how friction was explained. Such as cold weld and hot weld. 
 The noise produced when you push something across a surface is due to cold welds 
 I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting. 
 I found cold welds interesting because I hadn't heard about them (memorably) before
 The explanation of coefficient of friction was pretty interesting.

SUMMARY:

Many students found the topic of reference frames to be confusing, particularly when it came to understanding the concept of tension forces and how they relate to Newton's laws. Some students had difficulty with the idea of relative motion and phantom forces, and found it hard to picture the forces in different reference frames. Additionally, some students struggled with the math behind the equations and would have liked more practice problems to reinforce their understanding. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative, but would have benefited from more examples and explanations to help solidify their understanding of the topic.",Reference Frames,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.

SUMMARY:

Acceleration was a fascinating topic in today's lecture, with many students finding the discussion of terminal velocity, drag force, and centripetal force interesting. Many students enjoyed the real-life examples and applications of these concepts, such as the airplane jump example and the water/air plane jump problem. Some students found the discussion of acceleration changing suddenly, such as in the case of jumping out of a plane, to be particularly interesting.

SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the Right-Hand Rule to be a bit confusing, with some expressing difficulty in understanding the explanation, the practice problems, and the visualization of the rule on a 2D graph. Some students also had trouble with the derivation of the right-hand rule and the direction of the result of the cross product. Additionally, some students found the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs to be confusing. Overall, the students would benefit from more examples and practice with the Right-Hand Rule to solidify their understanding.",Right-Hand Rule,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

SUMMARY:

Many students found the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs to be confusing, particularly when interpreting the axes and using the right hand rule. Some students had trouble with drawing the graphs and understanding how to use the right hand rule in 3D space. However, the practice problems at the end of the lecture were helpful in clarifying these concepts.","Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs","The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, students found the dinosaur question and the related examples confusing. They had difficulty understanding how to find acceleration in relative motion, especially in 2D, and how to use the kinematic equations to solve the problem. Some students also found the quadratic equation confusing and struggled with the concept of negative and positive values. Additionally, a few students requested more practice problems and examples to help clarify the concepts.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!

SUMMARY:

Students had difficulty with the concepts of average and instantaneous velocity, particularly with the dinosaur example and the direction of acceleration. Some students found the sign changes and graphical representations confusing. Additionally, there were questions about how to use the kinematic equations and which equation to use for specific situations. Overall, students had a good understanding of the material but had some trouble with the more challenging examples and concepts.",Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, relative motion was a topic that several students found challenging. Some students struggled with understanding the concept of relative motion, while others had difficulty with specific examples or problems. Some common areas of confusion included the monkey example problem, the ball and pitching machine problem, and determining direction relative to different perspectives. Students also requested more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities and more examples to help them better understand the concept.",Relative Motion,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.

 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.

Based on the reflections, the most common topics that students found confusing were:

1. Relative motion and its applications
2. Vectors and their direction
3. Understanding the concept of reference frames
4. Difficulty in visualizing relative motion
5. Confusion with the equations and their usage

It is suggested to provide more examples and explanations on the topics of relative motion, vectors, and reference frames. Additionally, providing more practice problems and examples can help students better understand the concepts and overcome their confusion.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
 Tension forces 
 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections:

SUMMARY:

Many students struggled with the concept of adding and subtracting vectors, including the direction of the resultant vector and the difference between scalars and vectors. Some students also had trouble with the unit vectors and how they are used. Additionally, a few students found it difficult to understand when to use sin and cos for x and y. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but may benefit from additional practice and review of the concepts covered in the lecture.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",86,"How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?

 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",87,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and whichangles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the anglegiven.
When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle.

Some students also expressed a need for more practice with using TopHat and more context or explanation on unit vectors. Overall, the students' reflections suggest that the class may benefit from additional review and practice on these topics.",TopHat Question,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.

1. Friction on inclines and multiple forces applied.
2. Combining free body diagrams for two blocks on a frictionless surface.
3. Understanding the concept of push and pull in terms of force.
4. Difficulty in understanding the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1.
5. The difference between static and kinetic friction in real",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually

Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today

 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?

 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction.

The last question caused confusion among students, with difficulties in understanding how to approach the problem, combining free body diagrams, and determining the force needed to move one block on top of another. Some students found the concept of friction on inclined planes and the difference between static and kinetic friction challenging.",Last Question,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",94,"The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing

 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found centripetal force to be a confusing topic, with some struggling to understand why the acceleration vector points inward, and others having trouble determining the centripetal force. Some students were also confused by the application of acceleration at terminal velocity changes and the relationship between drag force and centripetal force. Additionally, some students requested more examples and explanations to help them better understand the concepts.",Centripital Force,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute

 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",102,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it

Specifically, students struggled with understanding how each variable impacts the overall equation for drag force, how to set up the equation to cancel out unknown variables, and how to apply drag force in three-dimensional circular motion. Additionally, students requested more examples and details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams.

Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to the focused topic of Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM):

SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class activity and the explanation of criteria with two metrics to be confusing. Some students were also confused about the difference between criteria and metrics, how to choose criteria, and how to determine the specific numbers for the metric. Additionally, some students were confused about how to test their prototypes and how metrics were different from criteria. A few students found the weighted decision matrix to be relatively straightforward and well-explained, but others found it confusing and complicated.

 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms.

I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) 
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion. 
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.

 I really liked how we were able to use excel and import data from online into an excel sheet and therefore analyze the data and make statements based on what we saw. 
 I find the bike share project very interesting. 
 The bike data
 Looking through the CoGo data on Excel and analyzing trends was very interesting.
 The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
 The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
 the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
 I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
 I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
 The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
 Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups 
 I liked doing the complex calculations in excel 
 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email. 
 How to use excel 
 How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.
 I enjoyed meeting new people in my breakout rooms and seeing what they drew for the in class activity.",118,"The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.

Extracted Related Reflections:

* Student Reflection 1: ""I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team, I was no longer confused.""
* Student Reflection 2: ""I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.""
* Student Reflection 3: ""I was confused on the in-class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?""
* Student Reflection 4: ""I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information.""
* Student Reflection 5: ""I was confused on the in-class participation. More specific details could have been shared.""

SUMMARY:
Based on the student reflections, there were some common areas of confusion regarding Assignment 13, including the energy topics, criteria, and in-class activities. Some students were also confused about the direction of the project and the specific details of the in-class participation. To address these issues, it may be helpful to provide more detailed information about the assignment and the in-class activities, as well as clarify the criteria and expectations for the project. Additionally, providing more examples or resources for finding information about the public library's emissions and economic information may be helpful.",Assignment 13,"I was not confused about anything
In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the topics of energy calculations and units were generally well-understood, with some confusion around specific aspects of the assignments and the project. Some students expressed a need for more clarity on the criteria and constraints of the assignments, while others were confused about the direction of the project or the information they were expected to include in their problem statements. Overall, the class seemed to be straightforward and well-executed, with most students feeling that the material was clear and well-presented.",Energy Calculations and Units,"I was not confused about anything
In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

 Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward. 
 I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.
 More information on assignment 13 
 I thought the mix up between the bright space calculation and the in class presentation calculation for the in class assignment was confusing.
 I just thought it was confusing when the file was corrupted for the in class activity.
 I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
 The in class activity was confusing as to what we were supposed to calculate. 
 nothing
 I'm still confused on the environmental portion of A13. 
 I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low 
 I thought the class was straightforward and there was nothing really confusing about it
 My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
 Today's class was good. 
 The A13 environmental impact was somewhat confusing.
 the differences in grams of CO2 per gallon of gas
 The in class activity had wrong numbers.
 At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2. 
 Nothing i'm doing pretty well
 The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
 nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
 Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
 The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing 
 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing
 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation. 
 I am not sure what the carbon footprint ya dot do with anything",130,"The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.

Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to Calculations:

SUMMARY:

Students found the calculations and problem-solving aspects of the class to be the most interesting and engaging. They enjoyed working in breakout rooms and applying real-world engineering practices to solve tangible problems. Many students found the instant volumetric flowrate calculations and the use of Excel to analyze data to be particularly interesting. Additionally, students appreciated the opportunity to work on a project and found the variety of functions in Excel to be useful.",Calculations,"I like the taum shauk project
I found the assignment 12 to be fascinating 
We have worked a lot during the breakout room!
I really liked that we're applying real engineering practices now because it is very interesting
A12
I found it interesting how power could be calculated for the reservoir 
The time spent with my team during today's class was super helpful!!! 
I enjoyed using excel line charts to analyze the the instantaneous rate of change of the volume of the reservoir 
The reservoir power equation and A12 were very interesting to start on
the class quiz
 I enjoyed how we had a lot of time to work on our project for this upcoming week, I thought it could of used more explanation though.
 I liked being able to work with my team.
 Best fit lines are very interesting.
 I thought that finding all the different unit conversions for the acre-feet was interesting

 Exam 
 I really liked the amount of time we had in breakout rooms to work on A12.
 Talking and communicating with my teammates
 nothing.

 Nothing stood out as it was mostly group work.
 Using math in class is getting interesting, more than just finding means, now we are using slope and instantaneous rate
 I liked getting to work in the breakout rooms, I feel like my team has a good understanding on the a12 assignment
 The most interest part of today's class was learning about the volumetric flow rate and how to calculate it of multiple intervals.
 I found it interesting how we are taking the slope and are going to change its units to get different values of Q.
 I liked how we talked about voting, bought awareness to it and I now know I can use my Purdue ID card.
 I liked that we got so much time to work with our team in class. It helped to get all of us on the same page.
 I thought that the fact that a12 was a continuation of a10 was interesting.
 Getting a good start on A12
 I was sent to the wrong break room and met new people so that was interesting. 
 There was not a whole lot of new information in this class besides information about assessments and assignments
 I found the instant volumetric flowrate calculations to be most interesting as I like calculus.
 I found working with my team most interesting.
 Nothing 
 Working on the project was interesting
 We spent the whole class time in breakout groups working on A12. It seems as though classes are starting to mean that way.
 I was interested by the variety of functions that excel can compute within itself.
 I found the ways we can use graphs to find distinct time intervals very interesting.
 I liked how we got a lot of time in breakout room to work on our project together!
 The information for Exam 1

They also enjoyed the activities that involved calculating their own carbon footprint and learning about climate change.",Teamwork,"Solar panel specs
I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later. 
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about. 
 I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
 That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
 I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13. 
 I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.

SUMMARY:

Based on the extracted reflections, it appears that some students had difficulty understanding the laminar approach and the assignment requirements for Assignment 10 and/or 11. Some students requested more explanation on how to calculate R^2 values, sst, and sse, and others were confused about the assignment requirements and the grey areas in the material. Overall, it seems that some students may have benefited from additional instruction and clarification on these topics.",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.

Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, students found the deliverables for the project to be somewhat confusing, particularly the in-class assignment and the open-ended nature of assignment 16. Some students were confused about what was required for the project and where to find the necessary information. However, the TA's explanation helped to clarify the project requirements for some students. Overall, the reflections suggest that students would benefit from more clarity on the deliverables and project requirements.",Deliverables,"The class wasn't confusing today.

SUMMARY: The students found the breakout rooms and group work to be helpful and engaging, with many mentioning the benefits of social interaction and the opportunity to work on assignments together. Some students also found the z-score and normal distribution concepts to be interesting and useful. Overall, the students enjoyed the activities and found them to be informative and engaging.",Breakout Rooms and Group Work,"I liked that we had a lot of time to work on assignment 8.
It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff

 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
 I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering. 
 I liked being able to work in the breakout room.

The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with mygroup when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would createissues with regards to easily conversing in class.
The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting
I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students
The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.
I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quiteinformative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for thefirst time.
I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions.
I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room andseeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to thefuture of engineering.
I liked being able to work in the breakout room."

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!

 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
 I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion in the class related to assignment explanations and descriptions were:

* Understanding the purpose and requirements of the assignments, particularly the Taum Sauk project
* Difficulty with the in-class activities and how to complete them
* Confusion about the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations
* Need for more information on how to make the graphs and perform the regression analysis
* Difficulty with the power equation and its variables
* Confusion about the due dates for some of the assignments

Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but had some difficulties with the assignments and in-class activities. Providing more information and clarification on the assignments and the laminar approach could help to address these issues.",Assignment Explanations and Descriptions,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.

I found how useful looking at the pros and cons of different ideas is togetting a working and viable solution to be the most interesting partof today’s class.
I think that the weighing pros and cons is helpful and it is an interesting way to make decisions that we do every day
Finding pros and cons is interesting because each product or service you can think of always has a way to do it better
The pros and cons about different subjects was interesting, and delvinginto explicit constraints that should always be considered.
Also how pros and cons are used in engineering.
It was interesting how pro and con lists work and how to use them in engineering design.
I was interested by the pros and cons in class activity
I didn’t know much about the different types of home coffee makers so it was interesting to learn about those two and also explore pros and cons
The way that the pro and con evaluation was taught.
I found it interesting just how helpful and thorough a pros and cons list can be.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!

 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B

 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today's class. As we've now reached the fourth week of class, I've adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don't think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn't find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.

 The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, there were some aspects of the lecture that were confusing for some students, particularly the in-class activity and the carbon emissions calculation. Some students found the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity to be confusing, while others were confused about how to determine if their assumptions were relevant to the client's needs. Additionally, a few students were confused about the purpose of the concentration of gas in the in-class assignment slide. Overall, the reflections suggest that the lecture could benefit from additional clarification and support in these areas.",Gasoline Density," no

The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.

 The changes made to correct engineering failures
 I really enjoyed working with my team during the breakout room and we got a lot of work finished!",302,"I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be aninsightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based onnegligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved inorchestrating it.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
Working on the in class activity was interesting because I got to research the TAUM Sauk failure.
I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Saukreservoir to be an interesting part of today’s class
when rebuilding the dam, the company again refused to spend more money to add one.
The different causes of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.

First, I'll extract the relevant reflections related to Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10:

Extracted Related Reflections: [((1, ""It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture""), (2, ""I was confused about the in-class activity. How do you find peer-reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics."", ...), ...]

Next, I'll summarize the reflections into a coherent paragraph:

SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture clear and had few questions, but some were confused about the in-class activity and finding reliable sources for the assignment. Some students also requested more information on the laminar approach and mathematical models for Assignment 10. Additionally, a few students had issues with the Catme survey and needed more time to complete the assignment. Overall, the students seemed to understand the material well but had some difficulties with the assignment.

Please note that I did not include all the reflections as they were not all relevant to the focused topic. Also, I did not include any irrelevant information or suggestions such as ""make sure to bring this up in next class"" or ""Consider this for future lectures"", etc.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.

 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",305,"The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusingbecause it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came tocalculations.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, sinceit wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum SaukReservoir project.
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.

 I really like this topic and it will be a lot of fun. The solar panel project will be really nice to learn.
 Learning about the way different power is generated. Looking at the different ways and new ways
 the project idea in general is very exciting and I look forward to this project.
 I like electricity and solar power so I am interested in this one. 
 Learning about electricity
 I loved the breakout rooms today! Our PT, Adam, is very helpful and we had a great conversation with him. Assignment 13 also seems very interesting, so we're excited to begin it. 
 I enjoyed discussing different forms and methods of energy transportation.
 I found the discussion of thermodynamics very interesting.
 What was interesting were the different ways we generate power and how it is done.",314,"Something I found most important in today’s class was the focus on units and their overall impact on calculations and results.
What I found most interesting from today’s class was the amount of energy conversion units.
It looks very interesting and I’m looking forward to writing about our findings and calculations.
It was interesting to see all the ways in which we can  convert units online.
I found the assignment we started, A13, was interesting as well as the finding a reliable conversion source.
I thought it was interesting to see all of the tools that are online to help with energy conversions. The website I found from the US Department of Energy had a lot of resources, which I found interesting.
I found the the discussion about what energy is and the whole unit conversion for it very interesting
calculating the cost of the plan"

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to the focused topic of ""Details Regarding Assignments"":

SUMMARY: Many students reported confusion regarding the assignments, particularly A08. Issues included understanding the instructions, filling in missing data, and organizing data. Some students also requested more practice with z-scores and how to use them to find the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. Additionally, there were requests for more detail on how to complete certain assignments, such as A08, and how to use excel for data analysis. Finally, some students found the material for A08 to be a little unclear and would have liked more detail on how to complete the assignment.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

Now, here's the summary of the reflections related to Statistics and Probability:

SUMMARY:

Many students found the concepts of probability and statistics to be confusing, particularly the z-score and how to use it in practice. Some students struggled with understanding how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example, and others had trouble with the assignment 08 and how to use Excel for the skittle example. Additionally, some students found the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb and the assignment 08 to be confusing and would have liked more examples and clarification. Overall, students would have benefited from more practice with the concepts of probability and statistics, as well as more detailed explanations and examples of how to use z-scores and fill in missing data.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, the main topics that were confusing for the students were:

1. Calculus formula for finding the area
2. Probability and standard distribution of data
3. Z-scores and their relationships
4. Assignment 8 and its instructions
5. Finding the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages
6. How to handle missing data in Excel
7. The due dates and expectations for each assignment
8. The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail

It is recommended to provide more explanation and practice on the above-mentioned topics, especially probability and standard distribution of data, z-scores, and assignment 8 instructions. Additionally, providing more details on the expectations for each assignment and how to handle missing data in Excel would be helpful for the students.","Formulas, Equations, or Calculations","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.

 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",322,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the Skittles Example was a topic that caused some confusion for the students. Specifically, they had difficulty understanding the calculus formula for finding the area, how to switch the x-axis to a percentage, and how to handle missing data in Excel. Additionally, some students felt that more explanation was needed for Assignment 08 and the concept of z-scores. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but may have benefited from additional clarification on these specific topics.",The Skittles Example,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines.

Some students also had trouble with the workload and the amount of material covered in the class.",Project Logistics,"nothing
There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the topic of Clients, Users, and Stakeholders was a common source of confusion for many students in today's class. Some students found the criteria and constraints for the problem statement to be confusing, while others were unclear on how to identify and differentiate between clients and users. Additionally, some students were confused about the purpose of the design project and how to approach the assignment. Finally, some students expressed frustration with the amount of material covered in the class and the lack of clarity on certain aspects of the project.","Clients, Users, and Stakeholders","nothing
There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time

 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

* Reflection 1: ""I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful.""
* Reflection 2: ""I enjoyed the idea generation with my team.""
* Reflection 4: ""I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project.""
* Reflection 5: ""I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering.""
* Reflection 6: ""I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teammates' thoughts varied.""
* Reflection 8: ""Not many things happened today, I did like the in-class activity which made me think outside the box.""
* Reflection 13: ""I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.""
* Reflection 17: ""I enjoyed working on the assignment and found it interesting how we could analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.""
* Reflection 22: ""I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in-class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.""
* Reflection 24: ""The interesting part about today's class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.""

Step 2: Summarize the extracted reflections in your own words (no more than 50 words)

Here is a summary of the reflections related to Assignment 17:

""Students found the group time and discussion about the assignment helpful, enjoyed the idea generation with their teams, and appreciated the evaluation of pros/cons of customer service. They found the discussion of pros and cons interesting, especially when related to engineering, and enjoyed coming up with ideas. The in-class activity made them think outside the box, and they appreciated the opportunity to analyze different products to see their pros and cons."" (47 words)",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
 Going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out. 
 It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
 working with my team on our project ☺️
 The application of ideas and models
 The ideas that our group came up with 
 exploring pros and cons
 What I found most interesting about today's class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians. 
 The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment.

I found the discussion on design trade offs very interesting
I found the way to find my car's carbon emission very interesting.
I found the entire lecture on the environment and our carbon footprint interesting. 
What I found most interesting in class was the amount of everyday life that contributes to your personal carbon footprint. I took the survey from the link shown in class to determine my own. 
The group time was very helpful and the carbon emissions talk was very interesting to learn about my personal effect
What I found most interesting about today's class was how engineers have to take into account everything that is going on into the world around them and apply that to the job they are doing. 
I found the website to calculate your personal carbon footprint interesting. 
It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety. 
 The in class activity was an interesting way to practice unit conversions
 I liked the theory at the beginning of the class when we talked about trade offs
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was the inclusion of carbon emissions and their importance to our project and their impact on the world we live in. Connecting it to engineering as a whole helped stress the importance of being aware of how your projects may impact the world and others.
 Something interesting in today's class was the carbon footprint website, because it was cool to see the impact I have on the world.

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main points that stood out for the topic of Projects were:

* The project was well-flushed out and explored, with clear instructions and no confusing parts.
* Some students found the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section to be a bit confusing.
* There was a need for more clarity on the difference between criteria and constraints, as well as how to identify stakeholders.
* Some students found the workload for the project to be unexpectedly large in a short amount of time.

Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the project and its requirements, but some clarification on certain aspects would be helpful to ensure a smooth completion of the project.",Projects,"nothing

SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion for Assignment 16 are:

1. Criteria and constraints for the problem statement
2. Purpose of the design project
3. Process of going back to the problem statement later in the project
4. Objectively seeing safety information
5. Difference between problem scoping and previous assignments
6. Gathering data for the project
7. Purpose of the survey of the public

SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the most common sources of confusion were related to the testing and prototyping process, specifically how to create and test prototypes, the use of materials, and the limitations of virtual platforms. Some students also found the discussion of the importance of prototyping to be interesting and easy to follow. Overall, the students expressed a need for more clarification on the testing procedure and the use of materials for prototypes.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.

 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.

 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be

 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room

I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally.
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes.
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.

SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the in-class activity was a source of confusion for some students, particularly in understanding the carbon footprint calculation and the criteria vs constraints. Some students also found the assumptions discussion to be confusing. However, the majority of students found the lecture to be straightforward and well-explained.",In class activity,"in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart. 
 I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.

It was interesting to finish the quiz and get it over with.
Nothing was that interesting in today's class. The topics discussed were neutral.
The breakout group time we had to work with out groups 
I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions 
What I found most interesting about today's class was how much processing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used to create a solution. 
I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
 I enjoyed the class it really is starting to seem like we are learning stuff that is going to be very important to us. I was also very excited to learn that A16 was not part 4 like we thought
 Learning about different types of problem solving
 I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
 I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
 I thought the beetle video was interesting because it was happening at Purdue and the way nature adapted was cool.
 Using Google to find patents and how it is all public information. 
 I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
 Even though the use of biomimicry was a little confusing, I did find how it was used in the video to be incredibly interesting!
 I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class. 
 The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering. 
 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before. 
 It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
 The prompt for the quiz was interesting.
 I enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of beetle shells used to make very strong force resistant shells.
 I found the idea iteration studio time interesting because it was fun to brainstorm possible solutions.
 Idea generation with my team
 I dont know what concept we use",424,"It was interesting seeing how humans are making technology that mimics animals.

SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections of the students, there were several aspects of the assignment and the class that were confusing for some students. These include the in-class activity, the use of functional decomposition, the example for pros and cons, the extent of the in-class assignment, and the details of the assignment. Additionally, some students were confused about the requirements for the iteration section and the expected depth of the pros and cons diagram. To improve the class, it may be helpful to provide more information on these topics and to clarify any confusion before the next class.",Assignment 17,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.

 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.

Does Multi-way RST have linked implementation or would that make it a DLB? 
dlb
Implementation of DLB is confusing. Trees/Tries use arrays and DLBs used linked lists but are these linked lists still contained in nodes or so they connect the levels as well? (does each linked list point to both sibling and child?)
Multi way RSTs. Not completely confused, but just redoing over how they work. Especially where the 256 came from
Drawing out the dlb tree and how the siblings are placed 
Runtimes of everything, too many to keep track of
Understanding what each variable meant in the runtime analyses
 what is a nodelet in a DLB? does every node in a linked list count as a nodelet?

Many students found the explanation of how to work with Matlab to be slow and confusing, particularly when it came to downloading and opening files. Some students had difficulty setting up the Matlab drive and finding assignments, while others were confused about how to save files and open them in Matlab. Additionally, some students requested a general folder for assignments and a calendar with due dates for upcoming assignments. Finally, a few students requested slower explanations and more guidance on how to save text in the command window for later reference.",Matlab/matlab/MATLAB,"Matlab drive

 opening the files
 Some things that were confusing was opening the files for the assignments, but that was expected. Someone eventually helped me out.     However, something else I think would be useful is a calendar with all the due dates for upcoming assignments. For example if it included the pre-class videos and assignments.
 Initially struggled with running a p file, got it once it was explained.
 At first, it was kind of confusing how to download the link and access certain files on the matlab desktop app. The TAs were very helpful if you asked for help, though. 
 It would be helpful if you could go over how we save the text in our command window if there is a way to do that so we can go back to work on code later if needed.
 Just explaining things a bit slower, I would look down at my laptop to follow along and when I would look back at the screen you would already be 3 steps ahead. My whole table was very lost as you were explaining.
 The wording on a submission text-box made it confusing as to whether we should submit the command alone or include the result.

In-Class Demonstrations were a helpful way for students to visualize and understand the concepts of phasors, sinusoidal functions, and the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Students found the interactive demonstrations, such as the spinning wheel and phasor diagram, to be particularly helpful in making the concepts easier to understand. Additionally, the ability to compare different plots of devices based on their connections was also found to be interesting. Overall, the in-class demonstrations were a valuable tool in helping students visualize and understand the concepts.",In-Class Demonstrations,"R is small, similar to how x is small in chemistry
The working diagrams and simulation representing the different changing phasors. 
the spinning wheel

the demonstration of how changing current inductance or resistance would change the graph 
The time that we can get for each V, C, 
The phaser magnets! 
I think the RLC graphing is interesting.
I was very interested to see the demonstration where we changed each variable and found that there was a large difference when looking at the graph
Phasor wheel, made the concepts easier to understand. 
 I found it interesting to see the vectors and how they aligned with the graph. Seeing them at the same time was a really helpful visual for me and the friends I sit with in class.
 The charts were fairly interesting and how they relate to each other as well as to time
 how phasers work

 The vector example you gave was an interesting way of seeing the sin function 
 how so many things are represented by a sinusoidal function 
 I found it interesting the period of the graph for charge is capacitance independent
 The spinning arrows made it more clear how the equations related to eachother
 The fast that all the voltages add up to emf.
 The animated graphs of voltage of a capacitor, resistor, and inductor 
 I thought the simulator graph showing how the three functions relate to the sin/cos curves and it helped me to better visualize and understand what was going on.
 Phasor diagram relation to time plot
 The visual representation of the vectors and graphs was helpful
 I liked the computer simulation of the phasors. 
 I found the demo that manipulated different parts of the circuit to transform the sine wave of the charge in the beginning of class the most interesting.
 We can calculate how fast things damp 
 I found it interesting when you showed the wave form in the demonstration
 The graph of the phasors on geogebra
 Amplitude and frequency of currents
 How inductors work 
 I found the visual with the dampening oscillation very interesting. That helped me visually understand how the graph changes when some of the factors change.
 The difference between inductive and conductive
 the different plots of the devices based on the things connected to it
 I thought that being able to compare everything graphically was really interesting.
 The demonstrations 
 I like the graph you showed on screen and how it changed when you changed certain parts of the circuit. 
 I found the math to be interesting since the equation relates to the graph so nicely 
 Knowing the period of a function can replace the time variable
 I found the oscillation of current to be very interesting because i thought current would only be some to flow constantly in one direction. 
 The demonstration 
 Oscilloscope demonstration of how changing capacitance, resistance, and inductance changes voltage oscillations
 I found the problem solving interesting. Even though the concepts were tough, the problem solving made sense.
 What was most interesting is seeing how the graph is affecting by changing characteristics such as amplitude. 
 I found the initial demonstration shown to be interesting. Additionally, understanding the various ways to solve for voltage and current, along with the idea of using phasors to do so was cool.
 I found the demonstration in which a graph for the circuit was displayed on the board and the capacitance and resistance were altered. This helped me visualize the affects of changes in capacitance and resistance on the circuit.

SUMMARY:

Students found the demonstrations and visual aids helpful in understanding the concepts of phasers and graphs. They enjoyed working through practice problems and found the concept of resonance interesting. Some students noted that the graphs were helpful in visualizing the relationships between components and found the actual galvanometer to be cool.",Related to Phasers & Graphs,"The graphs
The giant emf circle spinning
The average power is interested. To solve avg power
I felt as though it was really interesting how we can graph the relationships between inductors, capacitors, resistors and EMF.
I thought the demonstrations where the meter was projected onto the board to demonstrate the resonance in a circuit was helpful to understand the meaning behind the frequency of the circuit.
solitaire and the experiments 
Phasors 
The example problem with an RLC circuit at its resonance frequency 
I liked the last word problem we did as a class. 
The oscilloscope greatly increased my understanding of a circuit at resonance.
 I really liked the demonstration that showed that resonance is a higher amplitude
 how Z and R are related

 The idea of a current lagging or leading the emf is interesting because you can learn about the other aspects from it. 
 That current leads if there is a negative phase angle. 
 I found the problem solving interesting. It was interesting working out problems and solving.
 demonstrations 
 I liked going over the practice problems we did in class because they were quite helpful for solving the homework. 
 The demo with the sin waves
 The oscillations were pretty interesting
 having the visual representation of the phasors made it easier to do some of the questions
 I thought it was interesting to see how z = R at resonance.
 I enjoyed the changing oscillating ammeter. 
 visual of waves
 I loved the part in class where we were discussing the conceptual based questions
 The demonstration of the graphs
 Difference between wd and w
 Knowing the differences between the three with graphs and equations
 At resonance,  X_L=X_C
 Phasers are fun
 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution
