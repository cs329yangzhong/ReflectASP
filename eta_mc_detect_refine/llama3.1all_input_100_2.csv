I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.

Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.

These areas of confusion highlight the need for further clarification and examples to help students better understand these complex concepts",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.

Some students also had difficulty with the behavior of dipoles in uniform electric fields, including understanding when a dipole would be attracted to a plate. Additionally, there was confusion about the direction of electric fields and forces, as well as dipole moments",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
 The monkey experiment is interesting.
 The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
 The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
 The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
 Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
 The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool. 
 I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
 I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

 The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing
 How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing. 
 How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got. 
 Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope
 The forces being internalized
 Forces between blocks
 Something that was confusing was the force between two blocks pushed together. 
 I found the last one clicker question confusing with how to define the system.

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped

 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means.

 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.

 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.

 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters

 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.

 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen).

Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth

 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.

 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!

nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative.

I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.

 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors.

 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.

stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today

I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.

 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.

 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.

 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.

I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.

 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.

 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion

 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?

I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.

I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) 
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion. 
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us

The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.

Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing.

131,"The students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, but there were some areas of confusion regarding the project and assignment instructions. Some students were unsure about the bike project, including what it entails and how it will be completed. Others were unclear about the organization of homework and class schedule, particularly with regards to Brightspace and CATME assignments. A few students also mentioned difficulty navigating Brightspace and finding due dates for assignments. Overall, students appreciated the clear explanations and instructions, but would benefit from more details on project and assignment instructions",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"Suggestions: {original_sent: The students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, but there were some areas of confusion regarding the project and assignment instructions., the error span: The students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, but there were some areas of confusion regarding the project and assignment instructions., the revision suggestion: The students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, but there were some areas of confusion regarding the project instructions, particularly the bike project and assignment organization.}

The problem statement
I found it interesting that we are still able to complete projects while being socially distant.
The most interesting part of today's class was getting more information about the upcoming assignments for our last project and what we are going to work on in the upcoming weeks.  Now that we are beginning to wrap up the research side of the project it will be interesting when we present what we have created.
I like the amount of time we had to spend in breakout rooms working on the presentation
I found it interesting how we working on the practice exam for our i class activity 
What I found most interesting in today's class was that we get to make a video on our design project! It is cool to actually be able to design something together and then get to show other people.
I found it interesting that we now get to make a presentation to help talk about our solution! 
 I found working with my team and preparing for Exam 2 interesting today.
 using powerpoint to make a presentation 
 There was nothing today that I found interesting.

It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.

 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.

 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.

The error span is 'understanding factors that contribute to it.' because it is not directly related to the topic of power calculation. The original reflection (13, 'When the teacher explained the pressure head, I was a little confused by what factors go into this. Is it just a height ? ') implies that students were confused about the factors that contribute to pressure head, but the reflection does not mention other factors. Therefore, the revision suggestion is to limit the scope to pressure head.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had some difficulties with power calculation, particularly with converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding factors that contribute to pressure head.

 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information

The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.
nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms

 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.

 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
 I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering. 
 I liked being able to work in the breakout room.

the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.

 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.

 I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an interesting part of today's class. It was interesting because we got to see decision failures. 
 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
 I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred. 
 What was interesting about today's class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster. 
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.
 when rebuilding the dam, the company again refused to spend more money to add one. 
 The different causes of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. It reminds me that there are almost always multiple reasons for an engineering failure
 Talking about the failures was interesting to me because I really enjoyed the concept of learning from our failures although it makes the future career stressful knowing that we could cause things to go wrong 
 Researching what happened at the Rain Sauk Reservoir
 I enjoyed learned about engineering failures and their catastrophic impact on the surrounding environment and people. It highlights the importance of analyzing each situation to the fullest extent.
 Nothing exceptionally interesting. Good work time.

I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
 I found A12 to be most interesting today because I started to understand what some of the calculations were asking. I also found the engineering failures to be interesting.

Some students also needed more clarification on information literacy and how to search for reputable sources.'",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.

Discussion with my peers 
capital investments and determining whether investment is good or bad
I actually found the capital investment formula to be very interesting in today's class.
that it was very simple to find the payback period. 
Nothing really stuck out in today's class. It was just the usual with a new formula to calculate with.
The breakout groups. Not that the large class discussion isn't interesting I just found the time for the breakout groups helped the group figure out what we have to do
Learning the specifics of how energy expenses are economically impactful was interesting. 
I doing interesting the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced. This equation will definitely help my team during the project and we are able to see and understand how the factors relate. 
I found it interesting that companies have a capital investment payback period for upgrades on their products.
 I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting. 
 What I found most interesting about today's class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses. 
 That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
 I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
 The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.
 I found the payback time interesting and working more in groups on the project
 Something I found most important in today's class was the description on how group work should be assigned and completed. Making sure everyone is on the same page and everything has clarity was something I found necessary to explain to the class. 
 I found the in class activity very interesting and it helped us to understand what we need to do for Assignment 13. Also, the breakout rooms are extremely helpful and my team and I get a good amount of work finished. 
 The different types of energy usage 
 I thought our time in breakout rooms working on the assignment was the most interesting. The time in class is greatly appreciated.
 Today's most Interesting thing was learning more about how the different types of energy are use, how much they cost and how it all works.
 I was interested in the example used for the in-class activity because it somewhat pertained to a job that I had previously worked.
 I found it really interesting that companies are able to take into consideration the amount they're saving per unit in order to determine the payback time 
 Something interesting was the in-class activity, it was fun being able to learn how to solve for a payback period because it is cool to apply it to a real life example. 
 I found learning how to calculate the payback period interesting because when looking at the assignment I was intimidated by the concept. After practicing how to do it I feel a lot more confident.
 The equation introduced for payback was very interesting and explained well
 The most interesting part of today's class was getting to work in the assignment. 
 The in class activity for the payback period was interesting. Implementing the calculations into excel make everything easier. 
 I found the group project the most interesting in today's class. I learned a great deal about how to calculate both the economic and environmental impacts of the project. Overall it was very interesting. 
 It was interesting to learn about how companies may decide whether or not to invest something and what an investment entails.
 I found it most interesting when we were learning about how to calculate payback time given capital investment and savings. 
 Today's class overall was mostly breakout rooms so there wasn't much talked about other than the equations 
 I found it really interesting to learn how to calculate payback and how to use the equation to look at a model. 
 The calculation of payback period was interesting because it's nice to see a simple formula for something that can be thought of as complex
 It was interesting to learn about payback periods and how to calculate them for this project
 The economic analysis began to make more sense after the explanation given in class.
 I found determining payback times for different scenarios very interesting. 
 Learning about the payback cost
 I found the bearing in class participation interesting and how it could be applied to the real world/consulting
 I enjoyed working with my team in studio time. We were very productive
 I enjoyed learning about payback time and how to calculate it. It's an effective measure of if a capital investment is worthwhile or will result in negligible improvements.
 Calculating economical costs
 Not too much. Good work day

capital investments and determining whether investment is good or bad
I actually found the capital investment formula to be very interesting in today's class.
that it was very simple to find the payback period. 
Nothing really stuck out in today's class. It was just the usual with a new formula to calculate with.
The breakout groups. Not that the large class discussion isn't interesting I just found the time for the breakout groups helped the group figure out what we have to do
Learning the specifics of how energy expenses are economically impactful was interesting. 
I doing interesting the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced. This equation will definitely help my team during the project and we are able to see and understand how the factors relate. 
I found it interesting that companies have a capital investment payback period for upgrades on their products.
 I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting. 
 What I found most interesting about today's class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses. 
 That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
 I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
 The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.
 I found the payback time interesting and working more in groups on the project
 Something I found most important in today's class was the description on how group work should be assigned and completed. Making sure everyone is on the same page and everything has clarity was something I found necessary to explain to the class.

Many students struggled with handling missing data, understanding the z-score concept, and navigating the organization of assignments in Brightspace. There was also a need for more practice with probability and standard distribution of data, as well as more detailed explanations of how to apply probability from a histogram and graph bell curves on Excel.'",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.

 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual

 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information

This led to a better understanding of the assignment expectations and ultimately, successful completion of the task.'",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product.

There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be

 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project

I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
Nothing was confusing in today's class. Everything made sense that he was talking about in terms of idea generation and what was expected for the project.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic?
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
 I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.

Design process
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future
Even a detailed sketch can be a prototype. 
Ways we found that might work to develop our prototype 
I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting. 
I found the group time very helpful for assignment 18
it was exciting that i can make something
Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. 
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes. 
 I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping.
 Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff's costume. 
 The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping.
 What was due for assignment 17
 The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes
 I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. 
 The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype.  
 The ways that we will evaluate each prototype.
 I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with  my group about how to do prototypes.
 I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for starting the prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purdue has to offer to aid in the prototyping process.
 The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
 It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype.
 Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines 
 I like the idea of doing prototypes in general, especially how creative you can get while making/testing them. 
 I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap. 
 I'm enjoying this project as a whole and I'm looking forward to building and testing our prototypes. 
 What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative.
 The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
 It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
 I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. 
 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. 
 I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model 
 That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
 We didn't do much just got some work done. 
 Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. 
 I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. 
 expanding my knowledge on prototypes
 designing our prototypes
 We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
 It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
 I found working with my team interesting.
 Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
 I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out 
 I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone. 
 Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype

I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear.

There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.

I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.
 everything was pretty clear
 I didn't find anything that was too confusing in today's class.
 The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.

 How to download MATLAB to your computer and save and open MATLAB Drive files
 Going through how to save files to MatLab was the most confusing thing in class today. It just had a good amount of steps that were hard to follow. 
 I was really confused on how to download the files to Matlab

 opening the files
 Some things that were confusing was opening the files for the assignments, but that was expected. Someone eventually helped me out.     However, something else I think would be useful is a calendar with all the due dates for upcoming assignments. For example if it included the pre-class videos and assignments.
 Initially struggled with running a p file, got it once it was explained.
 At first, it was kind of confusing how to download the link and access certain files on the matlab desktop app. The TAs were very helpful if you asked for help, though. 
 It would be helpful if you could go over how we save the text in our command window if there is a way to do that so we can go back to work on code later if needed.
 Just explaining things a bit slower, I would look down at my laptop to follow along and when I would look back at the screen you would already be 3 steps ahead. My whole table was very lost as you were explaining.
 The wording on a submission text-box made it confusing as to whether we should submit the command alone or include the result.

 I find knowing when current goes through an insulator to be confusing because it changes over time. 
 I was a bit confused on the graphs of voltage vs time. I think I was mostly confused about how things like inductance can influence the amplitude or wavelength on a graph. 
 Understanding why in the demo the meter when to zero quickly, yet the equation suggests that current is slowly disappaited 
 I was confused on the function that defines current 
 How switching on and off current over periods of time affect potential energy in capacitors/inductors
 Difference between switch turned off and on.
 What was most confusing about class was deciding when to use the current switched on vs using the current switched off. 
 We learned about series and parallel with capacitors and resistors. What are the variables kept constantly in series and parallel for inductors?
 I was slightly confused by the idea of using energy to visualize RL and CL circuits. 
 It was hard for me to tell when to use which equation for finding current.
 How inductors act as wires
 Simple harmonic oscillation 
 I get confused with how inductors and resistors fit in a circuit together
 Rc circuit makes me little bit confused. With inductance
 It was confusing to me how we found which circuits would produce the most or least current ",583,"Suggestions: {original_sent: Students expressed confusion regarding various aspects of current, including the behavior of inductors in circuits, applying equations for finding current in RL circuits, and understanding the difference between Uc and Ul., the error span: the behavior of inductors in circuits, applying equations for finding current in RL circuits, and understanding the difference between Uc and Ul, the revision suggestion: Students expressed confusion regarding various aspects of current, including the behavior of inductors in circuits, applying equations for finding current in RL circuits, and the difference between Uc and Ul.
