The students had mixed understanding of the Gaussian surface topic, with some finding it confusing and others having a good grasp of the concept. The main areas of confusion were the choice of Gaussian surface, the orientation of planar electric fields, and the transition between different layers of charge. Some students also had difficulty with the concept of positive and negative charges and their effect on flux. Additionally, there was a request for more examples to aid in understanding. Overall, the students were able to understand the basic idea of the Gaussian surface, but struggled with some of the specific details and applications.",Gaussian surface,"i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me
I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface
More examples would be helpful for further understanding. 
Figuring out what Gaussian surface to draw in problems 
I was not too confused but the field lines of the right angle planes question for the quiz was confusing. 
Nothing was too confusing. The only part I found a little difficult was the different gauss fields around the uniformly charged inner sphere. Just transitioning from one layer to the next for me slightly confused in your last example problem video.
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this.

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the students had mixed understanding of the topic, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the main areas of confusion, such as the choice of Gaussian surface, the orientation of planar electric fields, and the transition between different layers of charge. This will help the instructor to focus their review and revision efforts on the most critical areas.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary mentions that more examples would be helpful for further understanding, but it would be even more effective to provide specific examples of how the Gaussian surface applies to different scenarios. For instance, the instructor could provide examples of how to choose the appropriate Gaussian surface for different types of charge distributions or how to use the Gaussian surface to calculate the electric field in different regions.
3. Clarify the relationship between positive and negative charges and flux: The summary mentions that some students had difficulty with the concept of positive and negative charges and their effect on flux. To address this, the instructor could provide additional explanation or examples that illustrate how positive and negative charges affect the flux through a Gaussian surface, and how this relates to the orientation of the surface. This will help students to better understand the relationship between charge distribution and flux, which is a critical aspect of the Gaussian surface topic.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

31,"  SUMMARY:

The students had mixed understanding of the Shell Theorem and Coulomb's Law in today's lecture. Some found the diagrams confusing, while others had trouble with the math steps in the examples. The concept of grounding was also unclear to some students. However, the majority of the students found the lecture well-explained and enjoyed the breakout rooms.

Some specific areas of confusion included:

* Understanding the diagrams and how to interpret them
* Difficulty with the math steps in the examples
* Confusion about grounding and the concept of charge remaining in a particle after it has been grounded
* Trouble with the second shell theorem and the electric force on a particle in a charged shell.

Despite these challenges, the students found the lecture well-explained and enjoyed the breakout rooms. To improve understanding, it may be helpful to review the diagrams and provide more in-depth explanations of the math steps in the examples. Additionally, clarifying the concept of grounding and the difference between the two shell theorems may help to address the remaining areas of confusion.",Shell Theorem/Coulomb's Law,"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two.

To address this, you could suggest providing more explicit instructions on when to use each formula, or offering additional practice problems to help students become more comfortable with the different formulas. Additionally, you could provide more context on why each formula is used, as this may help students better understand the underlying principles.

Overall, the suggestions should be tailored to address the specific areas of confusion and requests for more examples and explanations that were highlighted in the reflections. By focusing on these areas, the summary can be made more concise and focused on the topic of Capacitors.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the lecture on capacitors was generally well-understood, with only a few areas causing confusion. The main points of confusion were charge density, the setup of the integral, and the difference between series and parallel capacitors. Additionally, students had trouble conceptualizing and visualizing the topics, and requested additional examples and explanations to help solidify their understanding. To address these areas of confusion, it would be helpful to provide more visual aids, such as diagrams or graphs, and offer more examples of how capacitors are used in real-world applications. Furthermore, clarifying the use of different formulas for parallel and series capacitors, and providing more explicit instructions on when to use each formula, would help students better understand the underlying principles. By addressing these areas, the students will be better equipped to understand and apply the concepts of capacitors."

The majority of students in the class found the topic of electric fields and dipoles in a uniform field to be challenging. They reported confusion with calculating the moment of dipoles in non-uniform fields, understanding the physical properties of electric fields, and the relationship between electric fields and forces. Some students also found the practice problems to be rushed and requested more time to absorb the information. Additionally, there were questions about the binomial theorem and simple charge distributions. Finally, some students requested a review of potential energy of dipoles and the directions of electric fields and forces. Overall, the students found the material to be clear and concise, but would benefit from more time to digest the information and additional clarification on certain concepts.",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be well-structured and engaging, with a good balance of theory and practice.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope","  Sure! Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the main confusion points: The summary should focus on the key areas where students struggled the most, such as understanding the concept of tension, setting up free body diagrams, and the relationship between multiple objects and forces. By highlighting these points, the instructor can address the most critical areas of confusion and provide targeted support.
2. Use specific examples: Instead of generalizing the student reflections, the summary should provide specific examples of where students struggled. For instance, instead of saying ""the concept of tension,"" the summary could say ""students had trouble understanding why there were two tension forces in the problem with the man pulling himself up on a pulley."" This will help the instructor visualize the specific areas where students need more support.
3. Focus on the most common confusions: Some student reflections may be more repetitive or less relevant than others. To make the summary more concise, focus on the most common confusions and omit less relevant ones. For example, if many students struggled with the same problem, such as setting up free body diagrams for multiple objects, that should be emphasized over less common confusions.

65,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the concept of tension forces to be confusing, with many struggling to understand the direction of the forces and how to solve problems involving tension. Some students also had difficulty with the concept of inertial reference frames and how it relates to phantom forces. Additionally, some students requested more examples and practice problems to help reinforce their understanding of tension forces.

Specifically, students had trouble with the following topics:

* Understanding the direction of tension forces and how they interact with other forces
* Solving problems involving tension forces, particularly when there are multiple forces acting in different directions
* Applying Newton's laws to real-world scenarios, such as the tug of war example
* Visualizing and understanding the concept of inertial reference frames and how they affect the motion of objects

To address these challenges, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and practice problems that focus on tension forces and inertial reference frames. Additionally, instructors may want to consider using different visual aids or analogies to help students better understand these concepts.",Tension Problem,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside.

 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.

 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other.

 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside.

 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.

* The top hat questions were confusing, particularly the ones involving salami, and some students had trouble understanding the concept of inertial and non-inertial frames.
* Some students had trouble with the math, particularly when it came to determining the direction of forces, and found the explanation of tension forces and how they relate to Newton's laws to be confusing.

Overall, the students had a good understanding of the lecture content, but struggled with some of the conceptual questions and the application of Newton's laws to real-life situations. To address these issues, the instructor may want to consider providing more examples and explanations of the math-related concepts, and reinforcing the concept of inertial and non-inertial frames to help students better understand the topic."

Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.

 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting

79,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the dinosaur question to be confusing, with issues arising from the direction of acceleration, the use of positive and negative directions, and the application of kinematic equations. Some students also struggled with the concept of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration, as well as the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and position. Additionally, a few students found the calculus-based content challenging and would have benefited from more context and graphical representations. However, many students found the explanations clear and the practice problems helpful.

Specifically, students had difficulty with the following aspects of the dinosaur question:

* Understanding the direction of acceleration and how it relates to the direction of velocity
* Using the correct kinematic equation for the problem
* Filling in the known variables and understanding the concept of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration
* Applying the right hand rule to find the direction of the vector

To address these issues, the instructor may want to consider providing more examples and practice problems, as well as reinforcing the concepts of velocity, acceleration, and position in future lectures. Additionally, providing more context and graphical representations for the calculus-based content may help students better understand and apply the concepts.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D

What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine.

 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

81,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the topic of relative and circular motion to be challenging, with many expressing confusion over the concepts of acceleration, velocity, and direction. The dinosaur example problem was particularly confusing for some students, with issues arising from the addition of accelerations, the concept of negative and positive directions, and the use of calculus-based content. Other students had difficulty with the distinction between average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration, as well as the relationship between velocity and acceleration in circular motion. Some students also found the graphs and examples used in the lecture to be helpful, while others requested more practice problems and clear explanations.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity

 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

86,"  SUMMARY: Today's lecture on vector math covered topics such as adding and subtracting vectors, using unit vectors, and the right-hand rule. Some students found it difficult to understand when to add or subtract vectors, while others struggled with the concept of unit vectors and their purpose. The lecture also covered the topic of negative vectors and how they affect the resultant vector. Some students requested more practice with unit vectors and negative vectors in future lectures. Overall, the lecture was clear and thorough, but some students found certain topics confusing.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",86,"How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?

A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Nowwhen I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end ofclass I was beginning to understand through techniques like the tracemethod.
Need more description about how you know what directions you drawvectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to findthe expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two othervectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the firstvector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused andothers in my breakout room were too.
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic.
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtractand when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not knowif you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them.
It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics.
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graphproblem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity inorder to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors inthe scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectorsby Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows tosuit a given equation when they are all out of order.
However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how theyaffect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know yousaid that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, speciallythe purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","  Sure! Here are three suggestions for improving the generated summary based on the reflections of the students:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding when to add or subtract vectors:

Suggestions: To help students better understand when to add or subtract vectors, provide more examples and practice problems that require them to apply this concept. Additionally, consider providing a clear and concise explanation of the difference between addition and subtraction in vector math, and how it relates to the direction of the resultant vector.

2. Provide more context and examples for unit vectors:

Suggestions: To help students better understand the purpose and usage of unit vectors, provide more examples and context on how they are used in real-world applications. Additionally, consider providing more practice problems that require students to work with unit vectors, such as finding the resultant vector of two or more vectors using unit vectors.

3. Clarify the concept of negative vectors and their effect on the resultant vector:

Suggestions: To help students better understand negative vectors and their effect on the resultant vector, provide more examples and practice problems that involve negative vectors. Additionally, consider providing a clear and concise explanation of how negative vectors affect the direction of the resultant vector, and how to identify when a negative vector is present in a problem.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the lecture on vector math covered adding and subtracting vectors, unit vectors, and the right-hand rule. Some students found it difficult to understand when to add or subtract vectors, while others struggled with the concept of unit vectors and their purpose. The lecture also covered negative vectors and their effect on the resultant vector. To improve understanding, more examples and practice problems should be provided to reinforce the concepts of adding and subtracting vectors, and the purpose and usage of unit vectors. Additionally, more examples and context should be given to clarify the concept of negative vectors and their effect on the resultant vector. Overall, the lecture was clear and thorough, but some students found certain topics confusing."
87,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the lecture on vectors and angles to be clear and well-explained, with a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were:

* Understanding when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given.
* Difficulty with subtracting vectors and understanding when to add or subtract them.
* Confusion about the direction of a negative vector and how it affects the resultant vector.
* Trouble with identifying scalars and vectors, and understanding when scalars need units or not.
* Difficulty with visualizing resultant vectors and understanding the relationship between the direction of the resultant vector and the value of the angle.
* Some students found the introduction to unit vectors to be confusing, and would have liked more context or explanation about this topic.
* A few students had trouble with the breakout rooms and getting used to using Top Hat.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful and well-structured, but would have benefited from more practice with adding and subtracting vectors, and more examples using unit vectors.",Angles,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.

 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

Here are three suggestions for improving the summary based on the original reflections and generated summaries, without adding irrelevants or suggesting future topics:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of angles, you could emphasize the main areas of confusion that emerged from the student reflections, such as understanding when to use sin and cos for x and y, difficulty with subtracting vectors, and trouble with identifying scalars and vectors. This will help the instructor quickly identify the areas that need more attention in future lectures.
2. Provide more specific examples: To help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion, you could provide more specific examples of the types of questions that caused difficulty for the students. For instance, you could mention whether the students had trouble with simple addition and subtraction problems, or whether they struggled with more complex problems involving angles and resultant vectors.
3. Offer suggestions for future lectures: To make the summary more actionable, you could offer suggestions for future lectures that could help address the areas of confusion. For example, you could suggest providing more examples using unit vectors, or devoting more time to practicing adding and subtracting vectors. This will give the instructor concrete ideas for how to improve future lectures.

Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections and the focused topic:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding unit vectors:

Suggestions: Consider providing more examples and practice problems involving unit vectors to help students solidify their understanding of this concept. Additionally, you may want to dedicate more time to explaining the purpose and importance of unit vectors in the lecture.

2. Clarify the difference between adding and subtracting vectors:

Suggestions: Provide more examples and visual aids to illustrate the difference between adding and subtracting vectors. You may also want to emphasize the importance of understanding the direction of the vectors being added or subtracted, and how this affects the resulting vector.

3. Provide more guidance on when to use negative vectors:

Suggestions: Offer more examples and practice problems involving negative vectors to help students become more comfortable with using them. Additionally, you may want to provide more guidance on when to use negative vectors in the lecture, and how they can be used to solve problems.

By incorporating these suggestions into the lecture, you can help address the common areas of confusion and improve the overall understanding of the topic for your students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the lecture on vector math was well-received, but some areas of confusion were identified. The most common issues were understanding unit vectors, differentiating between adding and subtracting vectors, and using negative vectors. To address these points of confusion, consider providing more examples and practice problems involving unit vectors, clarifying the difference between adding and subtracting vectors with visual aids, and offering more examples and practice problems involving negative vectors.

The majority of students found the topic of Two Blocks/Forces/Systems to be challenging, with many expressing confusion over the conceptual questions and the use of friction in the problems. Some students had difficulty understanding how to combine the forces of two blocks on top of each other, while others were confused by the idea of friction and how it affects the motion of blocks. The students also requested more examples and practice problems to help them better understand the topic.

Specifically, students reported confusion over the following concepts:

* Understanding the difference between push and pull forces
* Determining the force needed to move a block on top of another block
* Combining the forces of two blocks on top of each other
* Using friction to solve problems
* Understanding the concept of static and kinetic friction
* Identifying the appropriate type of friction to use in a given problem

To address these challenges, the instructor may want to consider providing more examples and practice problems, as well as spending more time on the conceptual questions to ensure that students have a solid understanding of the material. Additionally, the instructor may want to review the definitions of push and pull forces and the difference between static and kinetic friction to help students better understand these concepts.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.

 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them.

 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?

96,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the topic of Free Body Diagrams to be challenging, with many reporting confusion with the conceptual questions and the last problem of the lecture. Specifically, students struggled with understanding how to combine forces in multiple free body diagrams, and how to approach the last problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. Some students also requested more practice problems and examples to help solidify their understanding of the topic. Additionally, there were requests for more explanation on how to rearrange formulas and how to determine the coefficient of friction. Overall, the students found the lecture to be well-taught, but would benefit from more practice and examples to fully grasp the concept of Free Body Diagrams.",Free Body Diagrams,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

102,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the topic of centripetal force to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept of acceleration vector pointing towards the center of circular motion. Some students also struggled with the application of centripetal force in different situations, such as the skydiver entering the ocean and the example problem with the string and mass. Additionally, the students expressed a desire for more examples and applications to help them better understand the formulas and equations related to circular motion.

The students also had some confusion with the drag force, specifically with the application of drag force in different situations and the effect of density on terminal velocity. Some students found the example problems to be confusing, such as the problem with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight, and the pendulum example.

Overall, the students would like more examples, applications, and clarification on the concepts of circular motion, centripetal force, and drag force to better understand the topic.",Centripital Force,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",102,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it

The majority of students found today's lecture to be straightforward and clear, with no confusion. However, some students expressed confusion regarding specific aspects of the assignment, such as the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the process of creating the graphs for the project. Additionally, some students requested more information on how to approach the project, particularly in regards to finding information on the public library's emissions and economic information. Some students also expressed confusion about the in-class activity and the instructions for the assignment.

I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part

 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.

 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.

The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

 I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
 Nothing was confusing today.
 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
 Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward. 
 I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.
 More information on assignment 13 
 I thought the mix up between the bright space calculation and the in class presentation calculation for the in class assignment was confusing.
 I just thought it was confusing when the file was corrupted for the in class activity.
 I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
 The in class activity was confusing as to what we were supposed to calculate. 
 nothing
 I'm still confused on the environmental portion of A13. 
 I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low 
 I thought the class was straightforward and there was nothing really confusing about it
 My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
 Today's class was good. 
 The A13 environmental impact was somewhat confusing.
 the differences in grams of CO2 per gallon of gas
 The in class activity had wrong numbers.
 At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2. 
 Nothing i'm doing pretty well
 The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
 nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
 Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
 The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing 
 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing
 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation.

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the in-class activity and calculations for carbon emissions were confusing, it would be helpful to provide more detail on what specifically caused the confusion. For example, students mentioned discrepancies between the slides in Brightspace and the in-class presentation, as well as confusion about the criteria for the in-class participation. By highlighting these specific issues, the summary can provide more targeted recommendations for addressing the confusion.
2. Provide more context for the midterm/exam: The topic of the midterm/exam is mentioned as a source of confusion for some students, but the summary does not provide enough context to understand the nature of the confusion. It may be helpful to provide more information about the midterm/exam, such as the format of the exam, the topics covered, or any specific challenges that students may face. This can help students better prepare for the exam and reduce confusion.
3. Focus on the most common issues: While all of the reflections are included in the summary, it may be helpful to focus on the most common issues that were mentioned by the majority of students. For example, the confusion about the in-class activity and calculations for carbon emissions was mentioned by several students, and providing more detail on this issue may be more useful for the instructor than addressing every minor issue mentioned in the reflections. By focusing on the most common issues, the summary can provide more targeted recommendations for addressing the challenges faced by the majority of students.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion in the class were the in-class activity and calculations for carbon emissions, specifically the discrepancies between the slides in Brightspace and the in-class presentation, and the criteria for the in-class participation. Additionally, some students were confused about the midterm/exam, including the environmental portion of Assignment 13 and the discrepancy between the slide on Brightspace and the in-class presentation. To address these issues, the instructor should provide more detail on the in-class activity and calculations for carbon emissions, clarify the criteria for the in-class participation, and provide more context for the midterm/exam.

Here are three specific suggestions to improve the summary:

131,"  SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the majority of the students found the first lecture to be helpful and clear, with most expressing understanding of the class dynamics, Brightspace, and the Office 365. Some students requested more information on the Bike Share project and the upcoming assignments, while others were confused about the scheduling process and the due dates for assignments. Some students also requested more details on the CATME practice survey and the weekly class schedule. Overall, the students found the class to be interactive and helpful, with most expressing confidence in their understanding of the material.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.

 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

For example, the majority of students were confused about the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, the iteration process, and the feedback from Assignment 16. This will help the instructor focus on the areas that need the most attention.
2. Provide specific examples: The summary could benefit from specific examples of where the confusion lies. For instance, instead of saying ""the biomimicry concept,"" the summary could say ""students were confused about how to generate prototypes using biomicry, such as how to use the concept of nature-inspired design."" This will give the instructor a clearer understanding of the issues and help them provide targeted solutions.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: While it's important to report the sources of confusion, it's also important to highlight the impact of that confusion. For example, students reported feeling frustrated or unsure about how to proceed with the project. This will help the instructor understand the severity of the issue and the need for urgent attention.

The confusion has had a negative impact on their learning experience and progress. It is essential to address these issues promptly to ensure that students can complete the project successfully and maintain their motivation.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the most common sources of confusion were the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, the iteration process, and the feedback from Assignment 16. Additionally, students were confused about the due dates for the project and the parts that needed to be completed. The biomimicry concept and how to generate prototypes using it were also confusing for some students. To address these issues, the instructor should clarify the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, provide specific examples of how to complete the iteration process, and provide feedback on Assignment 16 as soon as possible. Furthermore, the instructor should clarify the due dates for the project and the parts that need to be completed. Finally, the instructor should provide additional support on the biomimicry concept and how to generate prototypes using it.

1. Emphasize the impact of car CO2 emissions: While the reflections mention the interest in the topic and the surprise at the high carbon footprint, the summary could benefit from a more explicit emphasis on the impact of car CO2 emissions on the environment. For example, the summary could highlight the contribution of car emissions to climate change and the need for reducing them to mitigate its effects.
2. Focus on the ethical considerations of engineering design: Many reflections mention the ethical considerations of engineering design and the importance of taking ethics into account when addressing climate change. The summary could delve deeper into this aspect, exploring the ethical implications of engineering decisions and the responsibility of engineers to consider the well-being of the community and the environment.
3. Use more specific language: Some reflections use vague language or generalizations, which can make the summary less specific and less impactful. To improve the summary, consider using more specific language and examples to illustrate the points being made. For instance, instead of ""the impact of individual actions,"" the summary could say ""the impact of driving gas-guzzling cars"" or ""the impact of carbon emissions from transportation.""

147,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept and its application to the assignments. Specifically, students were confused about how to use the laminar approach to calculate the volume of an ellipse and the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10. Additionally, some students were confused about the difference between SSE and SST, and the use of r and r^2 values. Some students also expressed confusion about the assignment A11 and the in-class quiz.

However, some students found the lecture to be clear and enjoyed the class, with one student stating that the actual definition of the r squared value could have been more clear. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but struggled with the application of the laminar approach to the assignments.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.

Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture to be clear, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas where students experienced the most confusion. For example, the summary could state that the most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, particularly with regards to assignment 10, and the mathematical models. This will help the instructor to focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples of the requested explanations: Instead of simply stating that students requested more explanation on certain topics, the summary could provide more specific examples of what they would like to see. For instance, instead of saying that students requested more explanation on the other factors similar to r^2 value, the summary could provide an example of a specific concept or formula that students were confused about. This will help the instructor to better understand what specific areas need more clarification.
3. Prioritize the suggestions based on frequency of occurrence: Some suggestions were mentioned more frequently than others. It would be helpful to prioritize the suggestions based on the frequency of occurrence, so that the instructor can focus on the most critical areas that need improvement. For example, if the majority of students were confused about the laminar approach, then the summary should prioritize that area as the most critical for the instructor to address.

Here is a revised version of the summary based on the above suggestions:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: The majority of students found the lecture to be clear, but the most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, particularly with regards to assignment 10 and the mathematical models.
2. Provide more specific examples of the requested explanations: Students requested more explanation on the laminar approach, particularly with regards to how to use it to calculate the volume, and how to calculate the coefficient of friction for each material.
3. Prioritize the suggestions based on frequency of occurrence: The most critical areas that need improvement are the laminar approach and the mathematical models, as these were the most common areas of confusion for the students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections provided, the majority of students found the lecture to be clear and straightforward, with a few areas of confusion. The most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, particularly with regards to assignment 10 and the mathematical models. Some students were also confused about the difference between SSE and SST, and the instructions for assignment 10 were found to be confusing.

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

1. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion: Instead of mentioning that ""some students had confusion with specific aspects of the assignment,"" the summary could focus on the specific areas that caused confusion, such as calculating the pressure head and using Excel for Assignment 12. This will give the instructor a clearer understanding of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: While the original summary mentions that some students found the instructions for the exam and in-class activity to be confusing, it would be more helpful to provide specific examples of what was confusing. For instance, was it the wording of the instructions, the format of the exam, or the expectations for the in-class activity? Providing specific examples will help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and how to address it.
3. Focus on the most common areas of confusion: Based on the reflections, it seems that the most common areas of confusion were calculating the pressure head and using Excel for Assignment 12. The summary could focus on these areas specifically, and provide more detail on how the instructor can help students overcome these challenges. This will ensure that the instructor is addressing the most pressing issues and providing targeted support to students.

1. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion: Instead of simply stating that the instructions were unclear, highlight the specific areas that caused confusion, such as the scope of the project, the required parts of the assignment, and the problem statement. This will provide a clearer picture of the issues and help the instructor identify the areas that need improvement.
2. Provide specific examples: To make the summary more concrete, provide specific examples of the confusion. For instance, instead of saying ""the location of the assignment was confusing,"" provide an example such as ""some students were unsure where to find the assignment in Brightspace."" This will help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and how to address it.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: To make the summary more impactful, focus on the impact of the confusion on the students. For example, instead of saying ""the instructions were unclear,"" say ""the unclear instructions caused some students to struggle with the assignment and left them uncertain about what was required."" This will help the instructor understand the consequences of the confusion and the need for improvement.

Here's the revised summary incorporating these suggestions:

nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.

I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.

Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.

166,"  SUMMARY: The students had various levels of understanding and confusion regarding the equations and formulas covered in the lecture. Some common areas of confusion included the in-class assignment, the laminar approach, and the mathematical models for the Taum Sauk project. Many students reported difficulty with understanding the instructions for the in-class activity and the A10 assignment, as well as confusion about which variables to use and how to find them. Some students also requested more explanation on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but could benefit from more clarification on certain topics and more examples to help reinforce their understanding.",Equations and Formulas,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of. 
 I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered. 
 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.
 I thought that today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: While the summary should acknowledge the variety of understanding and confusion among the students, it would be more effective to focus on the most common areas of confusion, such as the in-class assignment, the laminar approach, and the A10 assignment. This will help the instructor prioritize the areas that need the most attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the equations and formulas that caused confusion. For instance, instead of simply stating that the students were confused about the ""first equation,"" the summary could specify which equation it was and what the confusion was regarding. This will help the instructor better understand the areas where the students need more support.
3. Focus on the focused topic: As the summary is focused on the topic of Equations and Formulas, it would be helpful to limit the suggestions to that topic only. For instance, the suggestion to ""go over the module a little more"" could be omitted as it is not directly related to the focused topic. This will help the instructor stay focused on the most important areas that need improvement.

1. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion: Instead of generalizing the confusion to ""the topic of mathematical modeling,"" highlight the specific areas that caused confusion, such as the in-class assignment, the laminar approach, and the A10 assignment. This will give the instructor a clearer picture of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more detail on the laminar approach: Several students expressed confusion about the laminar approach, so it may be helpful to provide more detail on this topic in the summary. This could include a brief explanation of what the laminar approach is, how it is used to create mathematical models, and any specific challenges that students faced when trying to understand it.
3. Offer specific suggestions for improvement: Instead of simply stating that the class was ""straightforward"" or ""challenging,"" offer specific suggestions for how the instructor can improve the course. For example, you could suggest providing more examples or explanations of difficult equations, or offering additional guidance on the A10 assignment. This will give the instructor concrete actions they can take to address the areas of confusion and improve the course.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.

179,"  SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear and understandable, with only a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were related to Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. Specifically, students were unsure about the expectations for Assignment 10, how to complete the mathematical models for the project, and how to cite sources properly. Additionally, some students were confused about the laminar approach and how to interpret the data for the assignment. Overall, the students felt that more clarification and examples would be helpful in understanding the assignment and its requirements.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the reflections provided:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture clear, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the areas that caused confusion. For example, the summary could state that Assignment 10 and the in-class activity were the main sources of confusion, and provide more detail on what specifically caused confusion for each of these topics.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of what caused confusion for each topic. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were unsure about the expectations for Assignment 10, the summary could provide an example of a specific question or issue that students had. This would help to give a clearer picture of the areas where students need more clarification.
3. Focus on the most common sources of confusion: While all of the reflections were considered, it may be helpful to focus on the most common sources of confusion. For example, if multiple students were confused about the same aspect of Assignment 10, it may be worth highlighting that as a key area of confusion. This would help to prioritize the most important issues and ensure that the instructor addresses the most pressing concerns.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections provided, the main areas of confusion for the students in the lecture were Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. Specifically, students were unsure about the expectations for Assignment 10, how to complete the mathematical models for the project, and how to cite sources properly. Additionally, some students were confused about the laminar approach and how to interpret the data for the assignment. To address these issues, the instructor should provide more clarification and examples on these topics, with a focus on the most common sources of confusion. For instance, the instructor could provide more detail on the specific parts of Assignment 10 that are causing confusion, and provide examples of how to properly cite sources. Additionally, the instructor could provide more information on the laminar approach and how to interpret the data for the assignment. By addressing these areas of confusion, the students will be better equipped to complete the assignment and participate in the in-class activity."

It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.","  Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the student reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Tom Sauk Reservoir:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary provides a general overview of the student reflections, it could be more effective if it highlighted the main sources of confusion. For instance, the summary could mention that the students had difficulty with the inclusion of constraints in the company's perspective, the unclear expectations for Assignment 10, and the difficulty with finding reliable sources for the in-class activity. This would help the instructor quickly identify the areas that need more attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the students' confusions. For instance, instead of simply stating that the students had difficulty with the Laminar Approach, the summary could provide an example of a specific question that the students had trouble with. This would help the instructor understand the nature of the students' confusion and provide more targeted feedback.
3. Focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir: While the summary mentions the Taum Sauk project, it could be more focused on the Tom Sauk Reservoir. The summary could be revised to emphasize the specific challenges that the students faced when learning about the Tom Sauk Reservoir, such as understanding the reservoir's design and operations. This would help the instructor understand the specific areas where the students need more support.

Here's an example of how the summary could be revised based on these suggestions:

Suggestions:

* Emphasize the main sources of confusion: The students had difficulty with the inclusion of constraints in the company's perspective, the unclear expectations for Assignment 10, and the difficulty with finding reliable sources for the in-class activity.
* Provide more specific examples: The students had trouble understanding the Laminar Approach, specifically with question X, and had difficulty finding reliable sources for the in-class activity.
* Focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir: The students had specific challenges when learning about the Tom Sauk Reservoir, such as understanding the reservoir's design and operations.

Overall, the revised summary should be more concise and focused on the specific challenges that the students faced when learning about the Tom Sauk Reservoir. This will help the instructor quickly identify the areas that need more attention and provide more targeted feedback to the students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion were the inclusion of constraints in the company's perspective, unclear expectations for Assignment 10, and difficulty with finding reliable sources for the in-class activity. Specifically, the students had trouble understanding the Laminar Approach, particularly with question X, and had difficulty finding reliable sources for the in-class activity. The students also had specific challenges when learning about the Tom Sauk Reservoir, such as understanding the reservoir's design and operations. To address these challenges, the instructor should focus on providing more detail on the assignment instructions, especially for parts 4 and 5 of A10, and clarify the use of scholarly sources and the difference between journal, website, and excerpt citations. Additionally, the instructor could provide more examples and clarification on the Laminar Approach and how to compute it, as well as provide more information on the Tom Sauk Reservoir to help the students better understand the specific challenges they faced."
182,"  SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear and understandable, with only a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were related to the Taum Sauk reservoir project, specifically parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10, and the laminar approach. Some students also had difficulty understanding the instructions for the in-class activity and the assignment 10. Additionally, there were questions about the acceptable sources for class assignments and how to cite them. The students requested more clarification on the laminar approach and the mathematical models for the project. Overall, the students found the information literacy section confusing and requested more elaboration on in-text citations.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

 I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
 I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
 I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
 CO2 footprint
 I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
 I liked that we had a lot of studio time to work on our assignments and finish then so that we don't have to spend time outside of class.
 I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
 I found it very inters to calculated the carbon emission of my car. I would have never thought it was that much. 
 I like the idea of talking about renewable energy's I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight 
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I'm glad it was covered in today's class period. 
 It was interesting to see our midterm grades, as well as learn about carbon footprints.
 Calculating how much CO2 our cars burned.
 I found the in class activity very interesting as well as the breakout rooms today! My team and I had a great conversation with our PT, Adam, and we also got a lot of work done for our project. 
 I think it's interesting to learn about climate change and what we can do as engineers to prevent it from getting worse.
 The equation and class activity for car mileage
 Corollas have really good MPGs.
 That our cars generate a los of co2.
 It was interesting to learn about and calculate co2 emissions for a car
 Carbon footprint
 I found it interesting to go over the Code of Conduct from the beginning of the year and work more on the project with my groups.

 Calculating carbon footprint of our cars
 I found it interesting the different costs we calculated in our assignment 
 Trade off designs were also interesting because they introduced a new idea to us that sounds like a good tool to use.
 calculating carbon emission for cars.
 How much carbon dioxide was emitted from natural gases. 
 finding my carbon footprint
 I found all the information on carbon footprints very interesting. 
 The discussion of design trade offs was very interesting to me. Providing examples as well as the importance of them was a topic that very much appealed to me.
 I found the c02 emissions of our cars and the associated calculations interesting
 I found the striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming very interesting
 I found the photos that were shown on climate change to be really interesting, they effectively show the large influence of global warming.",319,"The group time was very helpful and the carbon emissions talk was very interesting to learn about my personal effect
The criteria and constraints were very useful to think about what my group needs to consider still.

196,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on probability and z-scores to be confusing, with specific issues including:

* Confusion about how to calculate z-scores and their relationship to standard deviation
* Difficulty understanding the concept of z-scores and how to apply it to real-world problems
* Need for more examples and practice with using z-scores in Excel
* Confusion about the expectations for each assignment, particularly A08
* Difficulty with the skittle example, including how to switch the x-axis to a percentage and how to handle missing data
* Need for more details on the concept of z-scores and their relationship to standard deviation
* Confusion about the instructions for A05 and A08, including what data to use and how to organize it

Overall, students found the lecture to be confusing and would benefit from more examples and practice with z-scores and probability. Additionally, they would like more detailed instructions and explanations for each assignment, particularly A08.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions
What I found most interesting about today’s class was how muchprocessing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used tocreate a solution.
I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering.
It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before.
It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
I found the idea iteration studio time interesting because it was fun to brainstorm possible solutions.
Idea generation with my team","  Sure! Based on the original reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Idea Generation and Brainstorming:

1. Emphasize the main theme of the topic: Instead of starting with a general statement about the students' interest in the topic, consider starting with a sentence that emphasizes the main theme of Idea Generation and Brainstorming. For example, ""The students explored various methods for generating ideas, including biomimicry and idea iteration, and found the topic to be informative and useful for their future engineering careers.""
2. Focus on the most relevant points: While the original summary covers a range of topics, some points are more relevant to the focused topic of Idea Generation and Brainstorming than others. Consider focusing on the points that are most relevant to the topic, such as the use of biomimicry and idea iteration, and eliminating or de-emphasizing less relevant points.
3. Use more concise language: Some of the sentences in the original summary are quite long and could be shortened for greater clarity. Consider using more concise language to convey the same information, such as ""The students found the quiz engaging and a good way to apply their knowledge"" instead of ""The quiz was a valuable experience for the students to apply their knowledge.""

With these suggestions in mind, here is a revised summary:

SUMMARY:

The students explored various methods for generating ideas, including biomimicry and idea iteration, and found the topic to be informative and useful for their future engineering careers. They particularly enjoyed the quiz and breakout group time, which allowed them to work together and discuss differing approaches to finding solutions. The usage of nature to create solutions to design problems was also a highlight of the topic. Overall, the students found the class to be engaging and useful for their future engineering careers.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The students delved into the creative process of idea generation, exploring biomimicry and idea iteration, and found the topic to be both informative and useful for their future engineering careers. The quiz and breakout group time allowed them to apply their knowledge and collaborate on solutions. The class highlighted the innovative use of nature to solve design problems, leaving the students with a valuable understanding of the importance of idea generation in their future endeavors."
202,"  SUMMARY:

The students reflected on the recent lecture and provided feedback on various aspects of the course. The main points of confusion were related to the project logistics, specifically the scope and constraints of the problem statement, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the process of going back to the problem statement later in the project. Additionally, some students were confused about the metrics section and the purpose of the design project. Some students also requested more details on how to study for the in-class quiz and how to empathize with users.

The majority of the students found the class to be straightforward and easy to follow, with one student commenting that everything was ""seaplane"" in great detail. However, a few students expressed that the workload for the first milestone is unexpectedly large and may be challenging to complete in the given time frame.

Overall, the students' reflections highlight the need for more clarity on the project logistics and the importance of clearly defining the problem statement and its constraints. Additionally, some students may benefit from additional support in understanding the difference between criteria and constraints, as well as how to empathize with users.",Project Logistics,"nothing

1. Emphasize the need for clearer project logistics: The reflections suggest that students are struggling with the scope and constraints of the problem statement, as well as the difference between criteria and constraints. To address this, the instructor could provide more detailed explanations and examples of how to properly define the problem statement and its constraints, and how to differentiate between criteria and constraints.
2. Provide more guidance on empathizing with users: Some students expressed confusion about how to empathize with users, particularly online students who may not have a large network of people to interview. To address this, the instructor could provide more guidance on how to conduct user research, such as online surveys or interviews, and how to analyze and interpret user data.
3. Offer additional support for the first milestone: Several students expressed concern about the workload for the first milestone being unexpectedly large. To address this, the instructor could offer additional support, such as office hours or online tutorials, to help students manage their workload and ensure they are on track to complete the project within the given time frame.

There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward

 We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
 How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
 Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.

There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.

Use more specific language: To create a more precise and focused summary, the use of more specific language related to climate change, such as ""global warming"" or ""carbon footprint,"" could be beneficial. This would help to emphasize the importance of the topic and create a more coherent summary.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the topic of climate change and carbon footprints was found to be engaging and interesting. The in-class activities, such as calculating car CO2 emissions and exploring the carbon footprint website, were particularly well-received. The discussion on design trade-offs and the impact of engineering decisions on the environment was also well-received, as it highlighted the importance of considering the environmental impact of engineering decisions. The students appreciated the opportunity to work on their assignments and projects during studio time. Overall, the students found the topic of climate change to be relevant and thought-provoking, and they appreciated the opportunity to learn more about this important global issue.

To improve the summary, the following suggestions could be considered:

1. Emphasize the importance of climate change: While the topic was engaging and interesting, it is essential to emphasize the importance of this topic as a pressing global issue. Understanding climate change is crucial for engineers, as it can help them make more informed decisions in their professional lives.
2. Focus on the most relevant points: The discussion on design trade-offs and the impact of engineering decisions on the environment was particularly well-received by the students. These topics are critical for engineers to understand, and the summary could benefit from focusing more on these points.
3. Use more specific language: To create a more precise and focused summary, the use of more specific language related to climate change, such as ""global warming"" or ""carbon footprint,"" could be beneficial. This would help to emphasize the importance of the topic and create a more coherent summary."
216,"  SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the class seemed to be well-understood, with few confusing aspects. However, some students struggled with the difference between criteria and constraints, the process of empathizing with users, and the amount of work assigned in the in-class activity and assignment A16. Additionally, some students were confused about the project goalposts and the purpose of the design project. Some students also requested more details on how to study for the in-class quiz and the process of going back to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section.

The majority of the students found the class to be straightforward and easy to follow, with no major issues or difficulties. However, a few students mentioned that the workload for the first milestone is unexpectedly large and that more time should be spent on how to empathize with different users, especially for online students.

Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but may benefit from additional clarification on certain aspects of the project and more time spent on empathizing with users.",Projects,"nothing

1. Emphasize the common themes: While the student reflections highlight various aspects of the class that were confusing or needed more clarity, there are some common themes that stand out. For example, several students mentioned the confusion around the difference between criteria and constraints, the process of empathizing with users, and the amount of work assigned in the in-class activity and assignment A16. Emphasizing these common themes in the summary can help the instructor identify the areas that need more attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some of the student reflections mention specific examples or scenarios that were confusing or needed more clarity. Providing more specific examples in the summary can help the instructor understand the nature of the issues and provide targeted solutions. For example, instead of simply stating that ""the difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing,"" the summary could provide an example of a specific situation where the distinction was unclear.
3. Focus on the most critical issues: While all student reflections are important, some may be more critical than others. For example, the fact that several students were confused about the project goalposts and the purpose of the design project may indicate a more significant issue that needs to be addressed. Focusing on the most critical issues in the summary can help the instructor prioritize their efforts to address the most pressing needs of the students.

Here's an updated summary based on the above suggestions:

The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do.

 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room

1. Emphasize the common themes of confusion:

While the original summary highlights the various points of confusion, it would be helpful to emphasize the common themes that emerged from the reflections. For example, the majority of students found it difficult to understand how to create and test prototypes, especially when using CAD software. Additionally, many students were unsure about the level of detail required in their prototypes and how to test their virtual prototypes. By highlighting these common themes, the summary can provide a clearer picture of the challenges that the students faced.

2. Provide more specific examples:

The original summary could benefit from more specific examples of the challenges that the students faced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about how to test their prototypes, the summary could provide examples of the specific challenges that students encountered when trying to test their prototypes. This would give the instructor a clearer understanding of the issues that need to be addressed.

3. Focus on the most critical aspects:

The original summary covers a wide range of topics, including the specifications of assignment 18 and the implementation of questions for concrete details. While these topics are important, they may not be as critical as the issues related to prototyping and testing. Therefore, it would be helpful to focus the summary on the most critical aspects of the topic, such as the challenges of creating and testing prototypes, and the need for more clarification on how to measure the success of experiments. By focusing on the most critical aspects, the summary can provide a more concise and focused overview of the topic.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The students had mixed reactions to the biotechnology lecture, with some finding it confusing and others understanding it well. The main areas of confusion were the application of bio mimicry to the project and the difference between types of brainstorming techniques. Some students would have appreciated more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart and more information on the brainstorming process. To address these confusions, it may be helpful to provide specific examples of how bio mimicry can be applied to the design project and clarify the scope of the project, including what specific aspects of the project are due when. Overall, the class was productive, and students were able to work on their projects and complete the quiz.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

To address these confusions, it may be helpful to provide specific examples of how bio mimicry can be applied to the design project and clarify the scope of the project, including what specific aspects of the project are due when.

Specifically, students were confused about how to apply bio mimicry to their design projects, and would benefit from more information on how to use the natural world to inspire materials or structures. Additionally, some students were unsure about the scope of the project and what specific aspects of the project are due when. Providing more information on the overarching design project and what specific aspects of the project are due when could help students better understand the project's requirements and expectations.

Overall, the class was productive, and students were able to work on their projects and complete the quiz. To improve the class, it may be helpful to provide more specific examples of bio mimicry and clarify the scope of the project to help students better understand the assignment and its requirements."

 The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
 It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
 I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. 
 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. 
 I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model 
 That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
 We didn't do much just got some work done. 
 Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. 
 I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. 
 expanding my knowledge on prototypes
 designing our prototypes
 We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.

232,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture to be clear and straightforward, with no major confusion. However, some students had difficulty with the in-class activity, particularly with the French press and Keurig examples, as they had no prior knowledge of these coffee makers. Additionally, some students were confused about the requirements for Assignment 17, including the number of ideas to generate and the level of detail required for the pros and cons diagram. Some students also requested more information on the background information for the in-class activity and the type of solution necessary for the issue of prototyping. Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful and productive, with good clarification on the topic of pros and cons.",Assignment 17,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.

 Writing and combining 3 problem statements
 writing the problem statement
 It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
 I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don't repeat them. 
 I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.
 Trade off
 I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
 I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting 
 I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer

Emphasize the main points: The summary should highlight the key points discussed in the lecture, such as the implementation of DLBs, the difference between linked lists and arrays, and the confusion around multi-way RSTs. To do this, you could start the summary with a sentence that summarizes the main points, such as ""The class discussed the implementation of DLBs and the difference between linked lists and arrays, with a focus on the confusion around multi-way RSTs.""
2. Use specific language: Instead of using general terms like ""the material,"" ""the concept,"" and ""the process,"" use specific language that is directly related to DLBs. For example, you could say ""the class discussed the implementation of DLBs using linked lists and arrays"" instead of ""the material was well-explained.""
3. Avoid redundant information: The summary mentions ""nodelets"" and ""siblings"" in the same sentence, which is redundant. To avoid this, you could combine these two points into one sentence or remove one of them. Additionally, the summary mentions ""runtime analyses"" twice, which is also redundant. You could remove one of these mentions to make the summary more concise.

I found finding the initial velocity slope confusing","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, focusing on the topic of calculating velocity:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: Based on the reflections, it seems that the process of finding vmax for graphs and understanding the references needed for Milestone 1 were the main sources of confusion for the students. The summary could be improved by highlighting these areas and providing more detail on how to address these challenges. For example, the summary could mention that the process of finding vmax for graphs can be tricky, but that there are specific techniques that can be used to make it easier, such as finding the slope of the line and identifying the maximum velocity.
2. Provide more context for Milestone 1: Some students were confused about the objectives and requirements for Milestone 1, and found it difficult to understand the difference between M1a and M1. The summary could be improved by providing more context for Milestone 1, such as explaining the purpose of the milestone and how it fits into the overall project. This could help students understand the importance of Milestone 1 and how to approach it.
3. Simplify the language and avoid technical jargon: Some students reported that the lecture material was clear, but that they found certain terms and concepts confusing. The summary could be improved by simplifying the language and avoiding technical jargon whenever possible. For example, instead of using the term ""vmax,"" the summary could simply say ""maximum velocity."" This could help students who are not familiar with the technical terms used in the lecture.

In general I often feel like the last couple slides of each lecture are squeezed in and not explained as clearly or slowly as the rest of the content. But this is usually corrected in the next lecture of for this week videos.
I was a bit unsure about exactly what Cartesian products were, but after asking a friend I got it cleared up. We learned a lot of terminology and definitions today, but none of it was too complicated.
I was confused about ordered n-tuples and Cartesian products. They both covered rather quickly towards the end of class and I felt as though I didn't have time to process the information. Cartesian products are especially confusing because I'm enrolled in calc 1 at the same time as this class. I have yet to learn about anything in calc 1 that would support my understanding.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Cartesian product/Cartesian products:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the lecture clear and understandable, it could be more effective to focus on the main sources of confusion, such as Cartesian products and set builder notation. This could involve breaking down the summary into subtopics, with each subtopic addressing a specific area of confusion.
2. Use more specific language: The summary could benefit from more specific language to help readers better understand the concepts being discussed. For example, instead of using ""elements in certain subsets,"" the summary could use ""subsets of sets"" or ""elements in set theoretic constructions.""
3. Provide more context for the Russel Paradox: While the summary mentions the Russel Paradox, it could be helpful to provide more context for why this concept is important in set theory. This could involve explaining how the paradox arises from the naive set theoretic definition of Cartesian products, and how the formal definition of Cartesian products resolves the paradox.

Here's the revised summary incorporating these suggestions:

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on Cartesian products and set builder notation to be clear and understandable, with a few experiencing confusion towards the end of the class. The main sources of confusion were Cartesian products and set builder notation, with some students requesting more elaboration on how to understand these concepts in an abstract sense. Additionally, a few students mentioned that the last couple of slides were squeezed in and not explained as clearly as the rest of the content. However, with the help of a friend or by reviewing the material later, students were able to clarify their understanding. Practice problems will help solidify students' understanding of Cartesian products and set builder notation.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on Cartesian products and set builder notation to be clear and understandable, with a few experiencing confusion towards the end of the class. The main sources of confusion were Cartesian products and set builder notation, with some students requesting more elaboration on how to understand these concepts in an abstract sense. To address these confusions, the instructor could provide more examples and explanations on how to work with sets that are sets themselves, and how to understand the formal definition of Cartesian products in resolving the Russel Paradox. Additionally, the instructor could slow down the pace of the last couple of slides to ensure that all students have a clear understanding of the material before moving on. Practice problems will help solidify students' understanding of Cartesian products and set builder notation."
