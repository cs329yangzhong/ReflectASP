The students had mixed reactions to the last practice problem, with some finding it too rushed and others needing time to comprehend it after class. The concept of the electric field inside and outside a solid, uniform, insulating sphere was a source of confusion for some students. Additionally, the idea of choosing the appropriate Gaussian surface for a given problem was challenging for many students. Some students found the orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface to be confusing. The students also requested more examples to further their understanding of the topic. Finally, some students were confused about the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder and how to calculate them.

Overall, the students had a good understanding of the topic, but struggled with some of the specific concepts and examples. Providing more examples and clarifying the choice of Gaussian surface may help to address these issues.",Gaussian surface,"i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me
I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface
More examples would be helpful for further understanding. 
Figuring out what Gaussian surface to draw in problems 
I was not too confused but the field lines of the right angle planes question for the quiz was confusing.

I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this.

You could emphasize these points in the summary and provide more examples or clarification to address these areas of confusion.
2. Use more specific language: Some of the reflections mention that the students were confused about the ""orientation"" of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface. You could replace this with more specific language, such as ""the relationship between the electric field and the cylindrical Gaussian surface"" or ""the direction of the electric field in the presence of a cylindrical Gaussian surface.""
3. Focus on the main ideas: The original summary covers a lot of ground, but some of the points may not be essential to the main ideas of the topic. You could focus the summary more on the key concepts of Gaussian surface and the electric field, and exclude some of the less important details. For example, you could omit the mention of the concept quiz and the request for more examples, as these are not central to the topic.

* Difficulty with the second shell theorem and the concept of electric force on a particle due to the shell it is in
* Trouble with the ratio of charges in the concept question
* Some students felt that the lecture was rushed and would have benefited from more time to review the material

Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.

Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

The majority of students in the lecture had difficulty with the topic of Ohm's Law/Calculations. They found the examples and concepts confusing, particularly the splitting of amps in circuits, the relationship between emf and voltage difference, and the distinction between conductors, semiconductors, and resistors. Some students also struggled with the concept of power and how to apply Ohm's Law in different scenarios. Additionally, some found it challenging to understand the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery and the external voltage.

The students suggested that more examples and diagrams could be helpful in clarifying the concepts, and that the instructor should review the basics of Ohm's Law and when it can and cannot be applied. They also recommended more discussion on the differences between conductors, semiconductors, and resistors, and how to identify them.

I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school. I also like the visualization of graphs in general much more than vectors.",42,"Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see atwhat location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two differentaccelerations.

Overall, the monkey problem was found to be the most engaging and interesting topic in the lecture.",Monkey Problem,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.

I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.

I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.

 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

56,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of double tension in the man and pulley example. They found it challenging to comprehend why there are two tension forces acting on the man, and how the tension force is doubled when the man pulls himself up on the pulley. Some students also struggled with setting up the free body diagrams, especially when there were multiple objects interacting with each other. Additionally, the concept of internal forces and the forces between blocks were confusing for some students. However, the students generally found the lecture to be well-explained and the examples to be helpful in illustrating the concepts.

Key points:

* Double tension force in man and pulley example was confusing for many students
* Difficulty setting up free body diagrams for multiple objects
* Internal forces and forces between blocks were also confusing
* Lecture was well-explained and examples were helpful",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
How you could put more than one object in a system 
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
 I was confused about the free body diagrams. 
 The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
 The part that was confusing about today's lecture was the problem with the three blocks. I didn't know how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram for that.
 Some of the free body diagrams, such as the one with the ice blocks, still are not clear to me
 pulleys
 I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times.  This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
 doubling the force of tension 
 I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from. 
 I'm a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable 
 Double tension on a pulley and the principles behind it occurring
 The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing
 How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing. 
 How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got. 
 Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope
 The forces being internalized
 Forces between blocks
 Something that was confusing was the force between two blocks pushed together. 
 I found the last one clicker question confusing with how to define the system.
 I found the reasoning behind the man lifting himself with w/2 to be confusing
 force between multiple objects due to each other
 The links between various objects with strings of different tensions and acceleration directions were most confusing.",56,"The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension

1. Emphasize the double tension force concept: Many students struggled with the idea of double tension force in the man and pulley example. To address this, the summary could be revised to highlight the importance of understanding this concept and provide additional examples or explanations to reinforce it. For instance, the summary could state: ""The double tension force in the man and pulley example was a common source of confusion for many students. To better understand this concept, consider the following example: when the man pulls himself up on the pulley, he is applying a force to the rope, which in turn applies an equal and opposite force to the man. This creates two tension forces acting on the man, one from the rope and one from the pulley.""
2. Clarify the setting up of free body diagrams: Students also had difficulty setting up free body diagrams for multiple objects. To address this, the summary could provide more guidance on how to approach these problems. For example, the summary could suggest: ""When setting up free body diagrams for multiple objects, it can be helpful to start by identifying the forces acting on each object and then labeling them accordingly. For example, in the man and pulley example, we can identify the tension force in the rope, the normal force on the man, and the force of gravity acting on the man and the pulley.""
3. Provide additional examples or practice problems: Some students found the examples in the lecture to be helpful, while others struggled to understand the concepts. To address this, the summary could suggest providing additional examples or practice problems to reinforce the concepts covered in the lecture. For instance, the summary could state: ""To further reinforce your understanding of the double tension force and free body diagrams, try working through some additional practice problems or examples on your own. You can find these in your textbook or online resources.""

3. Provide additional examples or practice problems: Some students found the examples in the lecture to be helpful, while others struggled to understand the concepts. To address this, the summary could suggest providing additional examples or practice problems to reinforce the concepts covered in the lecture. For instance, the summary could state: ""To further reinforce your understanding of the double tension force and free body diagrams, try working through some additional practice problems or examples on your own. You can find these in your textbook or online resources."""
57,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of tension and how it relates to free body diagrams, particularly when there are multiple objects or forces involved. The 3 blocks example was a source of confusion for many students, as they struggled to understand how to set up the free body diagrams and how to determine the forces acting on each block. Some students found the idea of double tension confusing, and had trouble understanding why the force required to hold the man still was not just the tension in the rope. Additionally, some students had trouble with the concept of friction and how it affects the motion of objects.

Overall, the students had a good understanding of the concepts covered in the lecture, but struggled with the more complex examples and applications of the concepts. The students suggested that more challenging examples and problems could be helpful in reinforcing their understanding of the material.",3 Blocks Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

force between multiple objects due to each other","  Sure! Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the concept of multiple tension forces: Many students struggled with the idea of multiple tension forces in free body diagrams. To address this, the instructor could provide more examples and explanations of how multiple tension forces arise and how to represent them in free body diagrams.
2. Use more conceptual examples: Some students found the examples to be too simple and not challenging enough. To address this, the instructor could provide more conceptual examples that require a deeper understanding of the forces between objects, such as the forces between two objects with different masses or the forces between objects with different accelerations.
3. Clarify the source of the two tension forces: Some students were confused about the source of the two tension forces in the pulley problem. To address this, the instructor could provide a clear explanation of how the two tension forces arise and how they are related to the forces acting on the objects in the system.

By addressing these suggestions, the instructor can improve the students' understanding of the topic of forces between objects and provide more challenging and engaging examples for the students to work on.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main areas of difficulty for the topic of Forces Between Objects were:

1. Multiple tension forces: Students struggled with understanding how multiple tension forces arise in free body diagrams, particularly in situations involving pulleys and the man pulling himself up.
2. Conceptual examples: Some students found the examples to be too simple and not challenging enough, and requested more conceptual examples that require a deeper understanding of the forces between objects.
3. Source of tension forces: Some students were confused about the source of the two tension forces in the pulley problem, and requested a clear explanation of how these forces arise and their relationship to the forces acting on the objects in the system.

To address these areas of difficulty, the instructor could provide more examples and explanations of multiple tension forces, use more conceptual examples, and clarify the source of the two tension forces in the pulley problem. By doing so, the instructor can improve the students' understanding of the topic and provide more challenging and engaging examples for them to work on."

* Tension forces and the direction of forces in tension problems
* Understanding the concept of reference frames and how they relate to objects in motion
* Difficulty with some of the conceptual questions and applying Newton's laws to solve problems
* The math behind the equations and how to solve for specific forces in different directions.",Reference Frames,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing 
 I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other.",68,"If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.

Here are three suggestions to improve the summary for the focused topic of Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs:

1. Provide more examples of how to draw position, velocity, and acceleration graphs in real-world situations to help students better understand the material.
2. Clarify the explanation of the right-hand rule, particularly in 2D and 3D space, to help students better understand how to visualize the concept.
3. Include more practice problems using cross products to determine the direction of the result to help students become more comfortable with using cross products in different situations."

 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

The summary should highlight these areas and provide more explanation or examples to clarify these concepts.
2. Provide more examples or visual aids: Many students found the graphs and examples in the lecture to be helpful, but some still had trouble understanding the concepts. Providing more examples or visual aids, such as diagrams or animations, could help to clarify the material and make it more accessible to the students.
3. Break down complex concepts into simpler ones: Some students found the quadratic equation and the right hand rule to be confusing. Breaking down these concepts into simpler ones and providing more examples or explanations could help to clarify the material and make it more accessible to the students.

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the dinosaur question and the concept of acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D to be confusing. Many students had difficulty understanding the direction of acceleration and how to use the kinematic equations to solve problems. To address these issues, more examples or visual aids could be provided to clarify the material, and the concepts could be broken down into simpler ones to make them more accessible. Additionally, more explanation or examples could be given on the use of kinematic equations and the right hand rule to solve problems. Overall, the students had a good understanding of the material but had some trouble with the more challenging problems.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the dinosaur question and the concept of acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D to be confusing. Many students had difficulty understanding the direction of acceleration and how to use the kinematic equations to solve problems. To address these issues, more examples or visual aids could be provided to clarify the material, and the concepts could be broken down into simpler ones to make them more accessible. Additionally, more explanation or examples could be given on the use of kinematic equations and the right hand rule to solve problems.

Specifically, students had trouble with the following aspects:

* Understanding the direction of acceleration and how it relates to the direction of velocity and displacement.
* Using the kinematic equations to solve problems, especially when there are multiple objects or when the motion is circular.
* Applying the right hand rule to find the direction of acceleration and velocity.
* Understanding the difference between average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration.
* Using the quadratic equation to solve problems.

To improve the students' understanding of these concepts, the instructor could consider the following strategies:

* Provide more examples or visual aids to illustrate the concepts and how to apply them.
* Break down complex concepts into simpler ones and provide more explanation and examples for each step.
* Offer additional practice problems and provide feedback on common mistakes.
* Use different variable names or labels to help students understand the relationships between velocity, acceleration, and displacement.
* Emphasize the importance of understanding the direction of acceleration and how it relates to the direction of velocity and displacement."

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained

 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly

 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!

1. Emphasize the importance of visualizing relative motion: Many students mentioned that they found it difficult to understand when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. To address this, you could emphasize the importance of visualizing the motion of the objects and the relative motion between them. Providing more examples that show how to visually represent relative motion could help students better understand the concept.
2. Use more real-world examples: Students found the monkey and bullet examples to be confusing, so using more real-world examples that are easier to relate to could help make the concept more accessible. For example, you could use examples of cars or bicycles moving relative to each other, or objects dropped from different heights.
3. Break down complex problems into simpler ones: Some students mentioned that they got stuck on simplifying the projectile equations. To address this, you could break down complex problems into simpler ones and show how to solve them step by step. This could help students build confidence in their ability to solve relative motion problems.

86,"  SUMMARY: The majority of the students found the lecture on vector math to be clear and comprehensible, with a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were related to the use of sin and cos for x and y, the direction of negative vectors, and the identification of scalars and vectors. Some students also had trouble with the subtraction of vectors and the use of unit vectors. Additionally, a few students requested more practice with adding and subtracting vectors geometrically and making vector drawings for word problems. Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful, but could benefit from more practice and clarification on a few topics.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","  Sure! Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections and focused topic ""Vector Math"":

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion:

Instead of mentioning all the minor points of confusion, focus on the main areas that need more attention. In this case, the summary could highlight the confusion related to the use of sin and cos for x and y, the direction of negative vectors, and the identification of scalars and vectors. This will help the instructor prioritize the most critical topics that need more explanation or practice.

2. Provide more specific examples:

While the summary mentions that some students had trouble with the subtraction of vectors and the use of unit vectors, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of what these struggles looked like. For instance, the summary could mention that some students had trouble subtracting vectors when the vectors were not tail-to-tail or had trouble understanding when to use unit vectors. This will give the instructor a better idea of what concepts need more explanation or practice.

3. Offer suggestions for improvement:

The summary could suggest specific strategies or resources to help address the areas of confusion. For example, the summary could recommend that the instructor provide more examples of vector addition and subtraction, offer more practice problems, or provide additional resources such as video tutorials or online resources to help students better understand vector math. This will help the instructor take actionable steps to improve the students' understanding of the topic.

87,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the lecture on vectors and angles to be clear and well-explained, with a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were:

* Understanding when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given.
* Difficulty with subtracting vectors, especially when it came to determining whether to add or subtract them.
* Confusion about the direction of a negative vector and how it affects the resultant vector.
* Trouble understanding the relationship between the direction of a resultant vector and its value.
* Difficulty with identifying scalars and vectors, and whether or not scalars need units.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful, but would benefit from more practice problems and clarification on certain topics.",Angles,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.

Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",88,"Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.

1. Emphasize the practical applications of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs): The students found the practical examples to be engaging and thought-provoking, so it would be beneficial to highlight the real-world applications of FBDs in the summary. For example, you could mention how FBDs are used in industry to solve problems like the man pulling himself up with a pulley system, or how they can be used to lift heavy objects with less effort.
2. Focus on the concept of redefining systems: The focused topic of the summary is Redefining Systems, so it would be helpful to emphasize this concept throughout the summary. You could mention how the lecture showed how to redefine systems in order to solve problems more easily, or how the use of FBDs allows us to redefine the system in order to analyze the forces and motion more effectively.
3. Use more specific and technical language: The summary could benefit from using more specific and technical language to describe the concepts and techniques discussed in the lecture. For example, instead of saying ""resisting forces,"" you could say ""normal forces"" or ""frictional forces,"" and instead of ""drawing free body diagrams to set up equations,"" you could say ""creating FBDs to identify the forces and moments acting on the system."" This will help to convey the technical nature of the lecture and the importance of the concepts covered.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

:    The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up","  Sure! Here are three suggestions for improving the generated summary based on the students' reflections:

1. Emphasize the specific challenges with the last question: Instead of simply stating that the last question was the most confusing, the summary could highlight the specific challenges that students faced when attempting to solve it. For example, the summary could mention that students struggled with combining the two free body diagrams or understanding how to use the coefficient of friction. This would provide more detail and help the instructor understand the specific areas where students need more support.
2. Provide more detail on the concept of push and pull forces: Some students mentioned that they found the concept of push and pull forces confusing. To address this, the summary could provide more detail on the difference between push and pull forces, and how they are treated in the context of friction. This could include a brief explanation of how the coefficient of friction is used to calculate the force of friction, and how this force is different from other types of forces.
3. Include more specific examples of static friction: Several students requested more examples of static friction and how to use the static friction coefficient. To address this, the summary could include specific examples of how static friction is used in real-world situations, such as the example of a car tire on a wet road. This would help students see the practical relevance of static friction and how it is used to calculate the force of friction.

The students found the practice problems and examples in today's lecture to be challenging and engaging. The top hat questions were particularly interesting, with many students enjoying the ones related to relative motion, tension, and force pairs. The concept of tension and how it is the same throughout a rope was a major point of interest, as well as the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration. Many students found the use of real-world examples, such as the monkey experiment, to be helpful in understanding the concepts. The incorporation of forces into the problems and the use of free body diagrams were also highlighted as strengths of the lecture. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and engaging, with a focus on conceptual questions and real-world applications.",Top Hat Questions,"FBD
I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized

SUMMARY:

The students had mixed understanding of the lecture on circular motion, with some finding it confusing and others having a good grasp of the material. The main areas of confusion were centripetal force, terminal velocity, and the drag force equation. Many students struggled with the concept of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force, particularly the relationship between density, air resistance, and velocity. Additionally, some students found the example problems challenging, particularly those involving the skydiver and the pendulum. To address these issues, it may be helpful to provide more examples and applications that illustrate how the concepts of circular motion, centripetal force, and drag force can be applied in different situations, and to clarify the relationship between drag force and the variables that affect it.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

105,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the topic of Terminal Velocity to be challenging, with many expressing confusion over the concept of centripetal force and how it relates to circular motion. Some students also struggled with the application of drag force and the equations used to calculate it. Additionally, there were some questions about the density of the substance an object is entering or exiting and how it affects terminal velocity.

Some specific areas of confusion included:

* Understanding the difference between uniform and non-uniform circular motion
* Determining when to use different forces, such as centripetal and drag forces
* Comprehending the relationship between the drag force and the density of the substance an object is entering or exiting
* Applying the equations for terminal velocity and deriving them
* Understanding how to set up the equation for the drag force when there are multiple variables involved

Overall, the students would like more examples and applications to help them better understand the concepts of circular motion, centripetal force, and terminal velocity. They also would like more clarification on the relationship between density and terminal velocity.",Terminal Velocity,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes.

To improve the summary, you could focus on the most relevant information and omit details that are not essential to the topic. For example, you could exclude information about the due date of assignment 18 or the fact that some students found the English language confusing. By focusing on the most relevant information, you can make the summary more concise and focused on the topic criteria.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the most common sources of confusion were the criteria section and metrics section of the weighted decision matrix, as well as the difference between criteria and metrics. Some students found it difficult to distinguish between the two, and there was confusion about how to complete the decision matrix. Additionally, there was confusion about how to test prototypes. Specifically, some students were confused about how to fill out the decision matrix without fully understanding the WDM, and others were unsure about how to test their prototypes. To improve the summary, it would be helpful to emphasize these areas and provide more detail on what specifically caused confusion, as well as provide more specific examples to paint a clearer picture of the issues that students faced."
109,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the in-class activity and weighted decision matrix (WDM) to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty distinguishing between criteria and metrics, and understanding how to fill out the decision matrix. Some students were also confused about the purpose of the WDM and its application in real-world scenarios. Additionally, some students found the instructions for the in-class activity to be unclear, and the due date for assignment 18 to be confusing. However, some students found the explanation of the WDM to be good, and appreciated the clarification on how the numbers worked. Overall, the students found the in-class activity to be challenging, but valuable in understanding the concepts of weighted decision matrices.",In-Class Activity or In-Class Assignment," nothing
when assignment 18 was supposed to be due
Nothing
Constraints versus metrics
it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
 N/A
 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing. 
 Everything is pretty clear 
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 Nothing was really confusing to me today. 
 WDM
 The decision matrix
 I'm confused on how we are supposed to test our prototypes
 How metrics were different than criteria 
 I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
 The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
 Nothing was confusing and the weighted decision matrix was actually explained very well.
 i am running on not much sleep everything is confusing including English ",109,"it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the common themes of confusion: While the summary highlights the various points of confusion, it would be helpful to emphasize the common themes that emerged from the reflections. For example, the confusion about the criteria and metrics, the unclear instructions for the in-class activity, and the confusion about the purpose of the WDM. This can help the instructor identify the areas that need more clarification or attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some of the reflections mention specific issues they faced during the in-class activity, such as confusion about what to put as metrics in the WDM or how to fill out the decision matrix. Providing more specific examples of these issues can help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and address them more effectively.
3. Focus on the in-class activity and WDM: The summary should focus on the in-class activity and WDM, as these were the primary topics of the class. The reflections mention other issues, such as the due date of assignment 18, but these are not central to the topic of the in-class activity and WDM. By focusing on the primary topics, the summary can provide a more concise and focused overview of the students' reflections.

Here is the revised summary based on these suggestions:

 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.

The detailed projects that make up the class
I thought that the data collected in excel was interesting. I found that it was cool that the company was able to track and see how long each individual rider rode the bike.
I didn't think much was interesting, but I would have liked to hear more about the Problem Statement.
I had never heard of problem statements so that was interesting to learn.
Getting to roughly examine the file and analyze their data
I found the design and scoping cycle/process to be the most interesting because it will be an integral part of this class and in a future career.
I found learning about how to write a problem statement the most important and most interesting today.  I also found learning about excel to be interesting.
I found it really interesting how much data was collected from the bikes, and how much information you can track down from one excel file.
I was interested in how much data was collected by bike share. It seemed like they had a lot of information.
Proble scoping
 I really liked how we were able to use excel and import data from online into an excel sheet and therefore analyze the data and make statements based on what we saw. 
 I find the bike share project very interesting. 
 The bike data
 Looking through the CoGo data on Excel and analyzing trends was very interesting.
 The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
 The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
 the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
 I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
 I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
 The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
 Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups 
 I liked doing the complex calculations in excel 
 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email.

The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the student reflections:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the in-class activity was the main source of confusion, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the aspects of the activity that caused confusion, such as the vague instructions or the difficulty in finding information for the project. This will give the instructor a clearer understanding of the issues that need to be addressed.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13, the summary could provide an example of a specific question or issue that students had difficulty with. This will give the instructor a better understanding of the specific challenges that students faced.
3. Focus on the most common sources of confusion: While all student reflections were not confusing, some students reported confusion on specific topics, such as the energy units and the difference between criteria and constraints. It would be helpful to focus on these common sources of confusion and provide more detail on how to address them. For example, the summary could suggest providing more examples or explanations on the energy units and the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13. This will help the instructor identify the most pressing issues and provide targeted support to students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the in-class activity was a significant source of confusion for the students. Many students reported difficulty with understanding the expectations for the activity, particularly with regard to finding information on the public library's emissions and economic information. Additionally, some students expressed confusion about the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13. However, the majority of students found the lecture to be straightforward and reported understanding the materials well.

To address the confusion, it may be helpful to provide more specific instructions for the in-class activity, including examples of the types of information that should be included in the project. Additionally, providing more examples or explanations on the energy units and the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13 could help clarify these topics for students. Finally, it may be helpful to provide more information on the public library's emissions and economic information to help students understand where to find this information and how to use it in their projects."

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main issue: While the summary mentions several sources of confusion, it could benefit from more emphasis on the main issue of PowerPoint slide issues. To address this, you could revise the summary to focus more on the discrepancies between the slides in the PowerPoint presentation and the Brightspace materials, and how these issues affected the in-class activity.
2. Provide more specific examples: To make the summary more concrete and actionable, you could provide more specific examples of the PowerPoint slide issues that caused confusion. For instance, you could mention which slides were cut off or had different numbers, and how these issues impacted the in-class activity.
3. Focus on the impact: To make the summary more relevant to the instructor, you could focus more on the impact of the PowerPoint slide issues on the students' learning experience. For example, you could mention how the confusion caused by the slide issues affected the students' ability to complete the in-class activity or understand the concepts covered in the lecture. This could help the instructor understand the urgency of addressing the PowerPoint slide issues and take appropriate action.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main source of confusion during the lecture was the PowerPoint slide issues, specifically the discrepancies between the slides in the PowerPoint presentation and the Brightspace materials. The cut-off numbers on some slides caused confusion during the in-class activity, and some students found the conversion part of the activity to be confusing. Additionally, a few students were confused about the criteria for the in-class participation and the format of the final answer. To address these issues, it is recommended that the instructor reviews the PowerPoint slides carefully before class and ensures that the information is consistent across all materials. Providing more specific examples of the PowerPoint slide issues and their impact on the in-class activity could also help the instructor understand the urgency of addressing these issues and take appropriate action."

131,"  SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the majority of the students found the first lecture to be helpful and easy to follow, with clear explanations and instructions. Some students expressed confusion about the CourseMirror app setup and the scheduling process for the class. Additionally, some students requested more information on the Bike Share project and the upcoming assignments.

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.

 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.

When will we be starting the first project?","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the student reflections:

1. Emphasize the positive feedback: While the summary should highlight the areas where students found the lecture helpful, it should also emphasize the positive feedback more. For example, instead of saying ""some students expressed confusion about the CourseMirror app setup,"" the summary could say ""the majority of students found the app setup to be confusing."" This will give a more balanced view of the students' feedback.
2. Provide more specific suggestions: Instead of saying ""more information on the Bike Share project,"" the summary could suggest specific topics that the students would like more information on, such as the project's objectives, the expected outcomes, or the evaluation criteria. This will give the instructor more specific guidance on what to cover in the next lecture.
3. Focus on the most common issues: While all student reflections should be taken into account, the summary should focus on the most common issues that were raised. For example, if several students expressed confusion about the CourseMirror app setup, the summary should prioritize that issue and suggest solutions, such as providing step-by-step instructions on how to use the app or offering additional support during the next lecture.

The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it","  Sure! Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Deliverables/Instructions Unclear:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion: Instead of generalizing the confusion to ""deliverables and instructions,"" highlight the specific areas that caused confusion, such as the iteration section, the number of ideas required, and the project requirements. This will provide a clearer picture of the issues and help the instructor address them more effectively.
2. Provide more specific examples: While the original summary mentions ""Assignment 17,"" it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of the confusion, such as ""the iteration section of Assignment 17"" or ""the number of ideas required for Assignment 17."" This will help the instructor understand the specific issues that need to be addressed.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: Instead of simply stating that the deliverables and instructions were unclear, explain how the confusion affected the students. For example, you could mention that some students were unsure of how to proceed with the project, or that they spent more time trying to understand the instructions than they should have. This will help the instructor understand the impact of the confusion and prioritize the necessary changes.

Here's the revised summary based on these suggestions:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize specific areas of confusion: Many students reported confusion in specific areas, such as the iteration section of Assignment 17 and the number of ideas required. Some students were unsure about the project requirements, particularly regarding the number of idea generation techniques to use.
2. Provide more specific examples: The confusion was evident in the examples provided, such as the uncertainty about the due dates for the project and the in-class activity.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: The confusion had a significant impact on the students, causing them to spend more time trying to understand the instructions and potentially hindering their progress on the project.

I hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, there was significant confusion among students regarding the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, specifically in the iteration section and the number of ideas required. The feedback on Assignment 12 was also found to be confusing. Additionally, there was a lack of clarity on the project requirements, including the number of idea generation techniques to use. The due dates for the project and the in-class activity were also sources of confusion. However, the explanation of idea generation was considered clear and informative. To address these issues, the instructor should emphasize the specific areas of confusion, provide more specific examples, and focus on the impact of the confusion on the students."

The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept and its application to the assignments. Specifically, students were confused about how to use the laminar approach to calculate the volume of an ellipse and the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10. Additionally, some students were confused about the difference between SSE and SST, and the purpose of r-squared values. Some students also expressed confusion about the instructions for assignment 10 and the expectations for A11. However, some students found the lecture to be clear and enjoyed the class.

Overall, the students seemed to struggle with the laminar approach and its application to the assignments, and some found the instructions for the assignments to be unclear. It may be helpful to provide more explanation and examples on the laminar approach and its use in the assignments to clarify any confusion.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.

1. Emphasize the specific topics that caused confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the lecture clear and straightforward, it would be helpful to highlight the specific topics that caused confusion, such as the Laminar approach, R-squared values, and Part 5 of Assignment A10. This will give the instructor a better understanding of where to focus their clarification efforts.
2. Provide more detail on the mathematical models for A11: Some students expressed confusion over the mathematical models for A11, so it may be helpful to provide more detail on these models in the summary. This could include a brief explanation of what the models are and how they relate to the assignment.
3. Include specific examples of student reflections: To make the summary more engaging and informative, it may be helpful to include specific examples of student reflections that illustrate the common areas of confusion. For example, the summary could mention that several students were confused about the Laminar approach and how to calculate R-squared values. This will give the instructor a better sense of the types of issues that students are facing and how to address them.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the lecture on Regression was generally well-understood, but some areas of confusion were identified. Specifically, students had difficulty with the Laminar approach, calculating R-squared values, and Part 5 of Assignment A10. Additionally, some students were unsure about the difference between SST and SSE, and how to use Excel on a Mac. To address these issues, the instructor may want to provide more explanation on these topics, especially the Laminar approach and the mathematical models for A11. Providing specific examples of student reflections, such as confusion over the Laminar approach and R-squared values, will help the instructor understand the types of issues that students are facing and how to address them effectively."

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.

For example, the summary could mention that some students were unsure about how to set up the spreadsheet or how to enter the data correctly. By providing more detail, the instructor can help students better understand the assignment and reduce confusion.

Here is the revised summary with these suggestions incorporated:

Suggestions:

* Emphasize the main sources of confusion, such as unit conversions and the memo on the student answer sheet, to help the instructor target their explanations and examples more effectively.
* Clarify the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir by providing more detail about the steps that were confusing, such as calculating the pressure head or using the formula for total power.
* Provide more information about the Excel assignment for A12, such as how to set up the spreadsheet or how to enter the data correctly, to help students better understand the assignment and reduce confusion.

Original Summary:

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on power calculation to be clear and well-explained, with a few minor confusion points. Some students were unsure about how to convert units and were confused by the memo on the student answer sheet. Others were unclear on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir and had questions about how to complete the Excel assignment for A12. However, the class slides and breakout room discussions helped to clarify any confusion. Overall, the students found the lecture to be well-explained and felt prepared for the upcoming exam.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the lecture on power calculation was generally well-explained and clear, with a few minor confusion points. Some students were unsure about unit conversions, particularly converting between units of pressure and volume, and found the memo on the student answer sheet to be unclear. Additionally, some students were confused about the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir, specifically how to calculate the pressure head and how to use the formula. Finally, some students had questions about how to complete the Excel assignment for A12, such as how to set up the spreadsheet and how to enter the data correctly. However, the class slides and breakout room discussions helped to clarify any confusion. Overall, the students found the lecture to be well-explained and felt prepared for the upcoming exam.

To improve the summary, I suggest emphasizing the main sources of confusion, such as unit conversions and the memo on the student answer sheet, to help the instructor target their explanations and examples more effectively. Additionally, providing more detail about the steps that were confusing, such as calculating the pressure head or using the formula for total power, can help students better understand the process. Finally, offering more information about the Excel assignment for A12, such as how to set up the spreadsheet or how to enter the data correctly, can help students complete the assignment with confidence."

The students had mixed feelings about the clarity of the lecture and the in-class assignment, with some finding the main points clear while others experienced confusion regarding specific aspects of the project. The most common sources of confusion were the project scope, assignment 16 requirements, and the stakeholder information gathering process. Additionally, the open-endedness of assignment 16 and the process of gathering information from stakeholders were also confusing for some students. However, the TA's explanation of the project and the provided examples helped to clarify the expectations. To improve, the instructor may consider providing more specific examples of the project's requirements and offering additional clarification on the stakeholder information gathering process.

Here are three suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the reflections mention various sources of confusion, it may be helpful to highlight the most common ones, such as the project scope, assignment 16 requirements, and stakeholder information gathering process. This can help the instructor identify the areas that need the most attention and clarification.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some of the reflections mention specific aspects of the project that were confusing, such as the problem statement or the open-endedness of assignment 16. Providing more specific examples of these confusions can help the instructor understand the nature of the issues and address them more effectively.
3. Focus on the instructor's role in addressing confusion: While the reflections mention the TA's explanation of the project as a helpful aspect, it may be beneficial to emphasize the instructor's role in addressing confusion. For example, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide additional clarification on specific aspects of the project or offer more examples to illustrate the expectations."

I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.

166,"  SUMMARY:

The students had mixed feelings about the lecture on Equations and Formulas. Some found the in-class assignment confusing, particularly the part where they had to draw a simplified diagram of the reservoir and label it. Others were confused about the instructions for the laminar approach and how to create mathematical models in Excel. Some students also struggled with the first equation they had to calculate, and a few were unsure about the specifics of the Taum Sauk project. However, most students reported understanding the material and found the participation activity to be helpful.

The main areas of confusion were:

* In-class assignment and how to complete it
* Laminar approach and how to create mathematical models in Excel
* First equation and how to calculate it
* Specifics of the Taum Sauk project

Suggestions for future lectures include:

* Providing more examples of difficult equations to find
* Spending more time going over the module to ensure understanding
* Clarifying the instructions for the in-class assignment and the laminar approach
* Offering more guidance on how to create mathematical models in Excel.",Equations and Formulas,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.

169,"  SUMMARY:

The students had mixed understanding of the mathematical modeling concepts presented in today's lecture and in-class activities. Some found the height calculation of the pipeline confusing, while others were unsure about the in-class assignment instructions. The laminar approach and its variables were also a source of confusion for some students. Additionally, there were questions about the specifics of the 5B assignment and how to create mathematical models for the Taum Sauk tank. Some students also reported confusion about the pressure equation and its variables. However, the majority of the students reported that they understood the material well and had few questions.

The main areas of confusion were:

* Calculation of the height of the pipeline
* In-class assignment instructions
* Laminar approach and its variables
* 5B assignment specifics
* Pressure equation and its variables

2. Clarify the focus on testing and refining prototypes: The summary could emphasize the importance of testing and refining prototypes, as this was a common theme in the reflections. This could help to reinforce the key takeaways from the lecture and provide a clear direction for students to apply the concepts learned.
3. Provide more specific examples of prototyping methods: While the lecture covered different methods for creating prototypes, some students expressed confusion about how to create prototypes for abstract ideas. Providing more specific examples of prototyping methods for different types of ideas or projects could help to clarify the process and make it more accessible for students.

Here's a revised summary based on these suggestions:

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on prototyping/creating prototypes to be clear and well-explained, with a few experiencing confusion regarding the creation of prototypes for abstract ideas and the use of 3D design programs. The class worked well, and students were able to ask questions as they went along. The lecture emphasized the importance of testing and refining prototypes, and provided examples of different methods for creating prototypes. To build on this, future lectures could provide more specific examples of prototyping methods for abstract ideas and offer additional support for students struggling with this aspect of the course.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Here are three key points that can be taken away from the reflections:

1. Clarify the process for creating prototypes for abstract ideas: Students were confused about how to create prototypes for abstract ideas, and would benefit from more specific examples and guidance on this topic.
2. Emphasize the importance of testing and refining prototypes: The reflections highlighted the importance of testing and refining prototypes, and students would benefit from more emphasis on this aspect of the course.
3. Provide additional support for students struggling with prototyping: Some students were confused about the due dates for assignments and the use of 3D design programs. Offering additional support, such as supplementary materials or office hours, could help to address these issues and ensure that all students are able to successfully complete the course."

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!

 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find

 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly

 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.

in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the lecture content was clear, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion, such as the inclusion of constraints, the technical brief, and the Laminar Approach. This will give the instructor a better understanding of where to focus their clarification efforts.
2. Provide more specific examples of the sources of confusion: Instead of simply stating that students were confused about the difference between journal articles and websites, provide more specific examples of the types of sources that caused confusion. For instance, were students confused about how to identify scholarly sources, or how to differentiate between peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles? Providing specific examples will help the instructor tailor their clarification efforts more effectively.
3. Focus on the most critical aspects of the assignment: While it's important to address all of the areas of confusion mentioned in the reflections, it may be most critical to focus on the Laminar Approach and the mathematical models for Assignment 10. These are the most complex aspects of the assignment, and providing more detail and explanation on these topics may help alleviate the most confusion. Additionally, the summary could highlight the importance of understanding these concepts to ensure that students can complete the assignment successfully.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion during the Tom Sauk Reservoir lecture were:

1. Inclusion of constraints in the project: Some students were unclear on whether certain aspects of the project should be considered constraints, and how to determine which constraints to include.
2. Unclear expectations for Assignment 10: Students were confused about the specific requirements for the technical brief and mathematical modeling aspects of the assignment.
3. Difficulty with finding reliable sources: Some students struggled to identify reliable sources for the in-class activity, particularly when it came to differentiating between journal articles and websites.
4. Confusion on the Laminar Approach: Students were unclear on how to draw visual models for Parts 4 and 5 of Assignment 10, and needed more explanation on the Laminar Approach.
5. Need for more detail on assignment instructions: Some students felt that the instructions for Parts 4 and 5 of Assignment 10 were too vague and needed more detail to complete the assignment successfully.

To address these areas of confusion, the instructor should consider providing more specific examples of reliable sources, offering additional explanation on the Laminar Approach, and providing more detail on the assignment instructions, particularly for Parts 4 and 5 of Assignment 10. Additionally, the instructor may want to emphasize the importance of understanding the mathematical models and the Laminar Approach to ensure successful completion of the assignment."

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.

 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from

The majority of students reported that they had no issues with the material covered in today's lecture, with some mentioning that the class was straightforward and productive. However, there were a few points of confusion:

* Some students were unsure about how to find the distinct time intervals for part 6 of Assignment 12.
* There was confusion about how to submit Assignment 10, but this was resolved by the end of class.
* Some students found the calculations for the flow rate to be confusing and would have liked more explanation.
* There was a lack of clarity on how to determine the potential errors with different methods of finding the slope of a line.
* Some students were unsure about how to approach part 7 of the assignment.

Overall, the students reported that they understood the material covered in today's lecture, but would have benefited from more explanation on certain topics and more clarity on the assignment expectations.",Assignment 10,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
 The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
 Nothing was confusing in today's class, we had a lot of productive work time!
 I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn't that confusing
 I do not think anything in today's class was particularly confusing

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project

I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments

 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)

Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found certain topics confusing, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the most common sources of confusion. For example, the summary could mention that the largest source of confusion was the project goalposts being too soon and the large amount of work to be completed in a short amount of time. This would help the instructor prioritize which topics to address in future lectures or clarifications.
2. Provide more detail on the specific challenges with Assignment 16: The summary could benefit from more specific information about the challenges students faced with Assignment 16. For example, instead of simply stating that the workload was unexpectedly large, the summary could mention that students had difficulty understanding what sections were due and how to approach the assignment. This would give the instructor a better understanding of the specific issues students faced and how to address them.
3. Offer more specific suggestions for improvement: While the summary mentions that some clarification on certain topics and the workload for Assignment 16 would be beneficial, it would be helpful to provide more specific suggestions for how the instructor could address these issues. For example, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide more examples of what constitutes a well-written problem statement, or offer additional guidance on how to approach the assignment. This would give the instructor concrete actions to take to improve the learning experience for students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion in today's lecture were the project goalposts being too soon and the large amount of work to be completed in a short amount of time. Additionally, students had difficulty understanding the criteria and constraints for the problem statement, as well as how to incorporate stakeholders into the project. Some students also found the metrics section to be vague and the difference between criteria and constraints to be confusing.

Regarding Assignment 16, students were confused about the specific sections due and the workload being unexpectedly large. Some students also found it difficult to understand how to empathize with users, especially online students who may not know a large amount of people on or around campus. Finally, some students were confused about how to gather data for the project and the purpose of the design project.

To address these issues, the instructor could provide more examples of what constitutes a well-written problem statement and offer additional guidance on how to approach the assignment. Additionally, the instructor could provide more detail on the specific challenges with Assignment 16, such as the difficulty in understanding what sections were due and how to approach the assignment. By addressing these issues, the instructor can help to improve the learning experience for students and ensure that they have a clear understanding of the material."

Additionally, some students were confused about the level of detail required in their prototypes and how to create a testing protocol. The students found the discussion on the importance of prototyping to be interesting, but some felt that more examples and clarification on testing methods and materials would be helpful. Overall, the students expressed a need for more guidance on prototyping and testing.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be

 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.

 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

Some students were unsure of how to create a functional decomposition chart and would have benefited from more information on this topic. Additionally, some students were confused about the brainstorming process and how to generate ideas that are relevant to the project. However, most students found the class to be productive and appreciated the emphasis on biomimicry. There was a general desire for more information on how to apply these concepts to the project and how to scope the design project.",Biotechnology/Bio mimicry,"The biotechnology was a little confusing and could be explained a little more in the context of a17.
Something confusing in today's class was the instructions for the new A17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on. 
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project. 
It was a very good class pretty productive got a lot of stuff done.
We went over each type of physical idea that could be made like bio mimicry. The concepts were a little confusing.
Nothing. The assignment made sense and what the goals of different perspectives and ideas play into finding a solution 
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
Nothing was confusing in today's class. Everything made sense that he was talking about in terms of idea generation and what was expected for the project.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic?
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
 I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
 I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don't have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.
 I think it was a little confusing how biomimicry could be used for this project. There wasn't really any relevant example provided for how we could use it.
 I did not find much confusing in class today. Most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. 
 Nothing was really confusing today. Everything was well explained and easy to understand
 It was difficult trying to come up with solutions that weren't already implemented by Purdue. 
 More information about the brainstorming process would be helpful to aid our team
 There were no confusing topics today.
 Figuring out which parts of the overarching design project are due when was disorienting as it was not ever explained and only obscurely mentioned once on Brightspace.

1. Emphasize the main confusion points: Instead of summarizing the entire set of reflections, focus on the main confusion points that emerged from the students' responses. For example, the majority of students struggled with understanding how to apply biotechnology and bio mimicry to the current assignment, and some were unsure about how to create a functional decomposition chart. Highlighting these key points will help the instructor understand the areas where students need more clarity and support.
2. Provide more specific examples: While the reflections mention that students were confused about how to apply biotechnology and bio mimicry to the project, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of what these concepts look like in practice. For instance, the instructor could provide examples of how other design projects have successfully applied biomimicry or explain how certain biotechnologies could be used to solve specific design challenges. This will help students better understand how to apply these concepts to their own project.
3. Clarify the scope of the project: Some students mentioned that they were confused about the scope of the project and what was expected of them. To address this, the instructor could provide more information on the project's objectives, deliverables, and timeline. This will help students understand what they need to focus on and how to prioritize their time and efforts. Additionally, the instructor could provide more guidance on how to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and how to scope the project effectively.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion were the application of biotechnology and bio mimicry to the current assignment, the creation of a functional decomposition chart, and the brainstorming process.

However, some students struggled with the concept of RBSTs and the process of deletion, specifically the differences between RBSTs and other binary search trees. To improve understanding, more practice with binary search trees and additional clarification on the concept of RBSTs may be helpful. The class seemed to engage well with the topic, but may benefit from more specific examples of the deletion process and a focus on the key differences between RBSTs and other binary search trees.

Here's how I refined the summary based on the suggestions:

1. Emphasized the confusion around the concept of red-black trees: The original summary mentioned that the students struggled with the idea behind red-black trees, but did not provide enough detail. In the refined summary, I highlighted this point and provided more detail on the unique features of red-black trees.
2. Provided more specific examples of the deletion process: Some students requested more practice with binary search trees and seemed to have difficulty understanding the process of deletion in RBSTs. To address this, I provided more specific examples of how to delete nodes from RBSTs, such as the ""delete-fix"" algorithm, and explained how this process maintains the balance property of the tree.
3. Focused on the key differences between RBSTs and other binary search trees: The original summary did not highlight the key differences between RBSTs and other binary search trees. In the refined summary, I focused on the key differences, such as the use of a balance factor, the properties of red and black nodes, and the process of deletion. This will help the instructor understand the areas where the students need more clarification and practice."

1. Emphasize the connection between recursion and Computer Science: The students mentioned that they enjoyed the application of recursion to Computer Science, so it would be beneficial to highlight this connection in the summary. For example, the sentence ""The idea of using recursion to define functions, sequences, etc. is a topic I enjoy a lot.

2. Focus on the unique aspects of recursion: While the students mentioned that they found the topic of recursion interesting, it may be helpful to highlight what specifically made it stand out to them. For example, the sentence ""The mathematical jargon that went into showing recursive string concatenation was pretty cool"" could be included in the summary to emphasize the unique aspects of recursion that the students found interesting.
3. Use more specific language to describe the students' understanding: Instead of using general phrases like ""easier to understand,"" it would be more beneficial to use specific language to describe the students' understanding of recursion. For example, the sentence ""I found recursion to be a lot easier to understand than strong induction"" could be rephrased as ""I found the concept of recursive definition to be more intuitive than strong induction."" This more specific language will give a clearer picture of the students' understanding of the topic.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The students found the topic of recursion to be particularly engaging and informative. They appreciated the connection between recursion and Computer Science, and enjoyed the mathematical jargon used to explain recursive string concatenation. The unique aspect of recursion that stood out to the students was the use of mathematical jargon to prove theorems, which they found to be ""pretty cool.""

Students had difficulty understanding the Lenz's Law and the setup of the integral in the first in-class problem. They were also confused about the units in the second top hat question and the difference between Uc and Ul. Additionally, students had trouble applying the equations for finding current in an RL circuit and understanding the oscillations with inductors. Some students found it challenging to distinguish between current switched on and off and when to use each equation. The concept of using energy to visualize RL and CL circuits was also confusing for some students. Finally, students had trouble understanding how inductors and resistors fit together in a circuit and how to determine which circuits would produce the most or least current.",In-Class Problems,"I am still confused about finding the direction through lenz law.
