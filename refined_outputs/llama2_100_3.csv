Students had mixed understanding of the Gaussian surface topic, with some finding it confusing and others having a good grasp of the concept. The main areas of confusion were:

* Choosing the appropriate shape for the Gaussian surface, and whether multiple shapes would yield the same answer as the cylinder.
* Understanding the orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surfaces.
* Difficulty with the first problem on the concept quiz, which dealt with the angle at which flux flows from an object.
* Confusion about the relationship between conductors and insulators in relation to Gauss' law.
* Difficulty with the last example problem video, specifically transitioning from one layer to the next.

Overall, students found the concept of Gaussian surfaces to be challenging and would benefit from more examples and clarification on the different shapes and their applications.",Gaussian surface,"i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me
I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface
More examples would be helpful for further understanding. 
Figuring out what Gaussian surface to draw in problems 
I was not too confused but the field lines of the right angle planes question for the quiz was confusing. 
Nothing was too confusing. The only part I found a little difficult was the different gauss fields around the uniformly charged inner sphere. Just transitioning from one layer to the next for me slightly confused in your last example problem video.
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this.
 The second question on the concept quiz confused me, I wasn't sure how positive and negative charges being outside or inside affect flux.

The students found the topic of flux to be engaging and interesting, with many expressing that the concept questions were easy to answer after watching the lecture videos. The Faraday cage video was particularly well-received, with students commenting on the interesting way that insulators and conductors react to electric fields. The internal and external ends of a cylinder embedded in a conductor were found to have different flux values, and the use of Gaussian surfaces was seen as a helpful tool for simplifying complex problems. Gauss's Law was also found to be interesting, with students appreciating the simplicity of the dot product method for measuring flux. The use of field lines to determine the charge of a surface was also well-received, and the water example helped to clarify the concept for some students. However, some students still struggled with the subject and felt that more examples and practice problems would be helpful.",Flux,"I really like the flux topic. The concept questions about these were something that I found relatively easy to answer after watching the lecture videos in advance. 
The faraday cage video was really interesting.
It was interesting to see the way that insulators and conductors reacted to electric fields and how that affected the flux
I found Faraday cages cancelling out external electric fields very interesting. It was also neat how the internal cap of a cylinder imbedded in a conductor has no flux, but the external end does.
I liked the electric flux portion of the lecture this week. I liked reading the diagrams and solving for the charge in the example with the box. 
Flux and field lines with Gaussian 
I found Gauss's Law interesting based on the fact that it can simplify a very difficult problem
I find it interesting that such a complex value like flux can be measured by a dot product and not a more complicated calculus method. 
The diagrams helped me picture how flux works
I found GaussIan surfaces pretty interesting since you can draw a shape and then make solving Gauss' law easier to solve.
 conductors 
 How we can use field lines to determine the charge of a surface
 I found it most interesting that when E is a constant, it can be pulled out of the integration and all that's left is area.

 I thought it was interesting how we can prove the equation for E is correct by doing some math.
 I found out that Gauss's law is just flux over an imaginary shape, like a potato. I think this helped clear up much of my confusion.
 I had heard of Faraday Cages but I didn't really know what they were or how they worked so that was interesting
 The water example gave me an idea of the concept, but I still don't feel strong about the subject. ",23,"I really like the flux topic. The concept questions about these were something that I found relatively easy to answer after watching the lecture videos in advance.
It was interesting to see the way that insulators and conductors reacted to electric fields and how that affected the flux
I found Faraday cages cancelling out external electric fields very interesting. It was also neat how the internal cap of a cylinder imbedded in a conductor has no flux, but the external end does.

Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.

I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.

Students found the lecture on capacitors to be generally clear, with the exception of a few areas that caused confusion. These areas include:

1. Charge density and electric field: Some students had difficulty understanding the relationship between these two concepts and how they are related.
2. Simplifying circuit diagrams with capacitors: Some students found it challenging to understand how to re-orient capacitors in circuit diagrams, especially when there are multiple branches involved.
3. Series and parallel capacitors: Students were confused about the difference between series and parallel capacitors and how to determine which type to use in a given circuit.
4. Capacitor equivalence: Some students had trouble understanding the concept of capacitor equivalence and how to apply it in practice.
5. Electric current and density in insulators: Some students were confused about how electric current and density behave in insulators.

Overall, students found the lecture to be helpful but would benefit from additional examples and explanations to better understand these concepts.",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators
 The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

56,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of double tension in the man and pulley example. They found it challenging to comprehend why there were two tension forces acting on the man, and how the tension force was doubled when the man pulled himself up. Some students also struggled with the free body diagrams, particularly when there were multiple objects interacting with each other. Additionally, the concept of internal forces and the forces between blocks were confusing for some students. However, the students generally found the lecture to be well-explained and the examples to be helpful in illustrating the concepts.

Key points that need to be emphasized in future lectures include:

* The concept of double tension in the man and pulley example
* The proper setup of free body diagrams, especially when there are multiple objects interacting with each other
* The distinction between internal and external forces
* The forces between blocks and how they are affected by friction and other factors.",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

The students had difficulty understanding the concept of free body diagrams, particularly when it comes to representing forces and tension in equations. They found the examples using pulleys and the man pulling himself up to be challenging and confusing. Some students were confused about the existence of two tension forces in certain situations, and how to set up the free body diagrams for these problems. Additionally, the students had trouble understanding how to determine the acceleration of objects in certain situations, such as when there are multiple forces acting on an object.

The students found the concept of doubling the force of tension to be confusing, and some were unsure about the source of the two tension forces in the free body diagrams. They also had trouble understanding how to solve for a variable in these problems.

Overall, the students had a good understanding of the topic of free body diagrams, but struggled with some of the more challenging examples and the reasoning behind the forces and tensions in these situations.",Free Body Diagrams,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one

61,"  SUMMARY:

The students found the topic of Coefficient of Friction to be interesting and engaging. They enjoyed the conceptual questions and the interactive learning style of the top hat questions. The majority of the students found the explanation of static friction and the relationship between normal force and friction to be the most interesting aspects of the lecture. They also appreciated the use of real-life examples, such as the sandpaper block on the sandpaper ramp, to illustrate the concepts. Additionally, the students found the fact that surface area does not affect friction to be surprising. Overall, the students enjoyed the lecture and found it to be helpful in their understanding of the topic.",Coefficient of Friction,"I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level. 
While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren't too hard but not too easy as well. 
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.
Surprised by the answer to the second question, I thought the lower block was just put in to confuse us
Calculating the coefficient of friction for sandpaper 
I found that learning how to set up the system and what masses are included is important to solving friction problems
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
 Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
 It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction. 
 The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
 I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we've been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting. 
 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
 Break out room discussions
 I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style. 
 the concept of static friction changing with the force against it
 I enjoyed applying the coefficients of friction to a box on a slope.
 I really enjoyed the conceptual TopHat questions. I feel like they help me in application problems later in lecture and in the homework.
 i found the exapmle of solving for friction of the sand paper block interesting

65,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the concept of tension forces to be confusing, with some struggling to relate real-life examples to the theory presented in the videos. Many students requested more examples with angles given from different directions and a more thorough explanation of the salami question. Some students also found the top hat question about finding the second force to be confusing. Additionally, students had difficulty understanding how to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers.

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing 
 I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other.",68,"If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.

 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

80,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students in the class found the topic of Quadratic and Kinematic Equations to be challenging, with several students expressing confusion over the concepts of acceleration, velocity, and position in both 1D and 2D motion. The dinosaur example problem was particularly confusing for some students, with issues arising from the addition of accelerations, the direction of acceleration, and the use of calculus-based content. Some students also struggled with the concept of constant speed and the relationship between average and instantaneous velocities and accelerations. Additionally, there were some issues with the right hand rule and the use of vectors. Overall, the students found the lecture to be challenging, but the explanations and examples provided were helpful in clarifying the concepts.",Quadratic/Kinematic Equation,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.

 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

83,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found relative motion to be a challenging topic, with many expressing difficulty in understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and how to determine velocities from different perspectives. Some students reported confusion with the monkey and bullet examples, and the concept of relative motion in 2D. Additionally, some students requested more examples and practice problems to help solidify their understanding.

Specifically, students reported difficulty with:

* Understanding the concept of relative motion and how to apply it to real-world scenarios
* Determining the direction of velocities in different reference frames
* Adding and subtracting vectors in relative motion problems
* Understanding the relationship between the two Delta Y equations (monkey and bullet)
* Applying relative motion in 2D and determining the velocity of objects in different directions.

To address these challenges, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and practice problems, as well as clarify the concept of relative motion and how it is applied in different scenarios. Additionally, providing more time to work on practice problems and reviewing the basics of vector addition and subtraction may be beneficial.",Relative Motion,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.

 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday

 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity

 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

1. Emphasize the most common challenges: While all students found relative motion to be challenging, some struggled more with certain aspects than others. To improve the summary, you could focus on the most common challenges mentioned by students, such as understanding the concept of relative motion, determining velocities in different reference frames, and adding and subtracting vectors. This will give the instructor a better idea of where to focus their attention when addressing the class's challenges.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some students reported confusion with specific examples, such as the monkey and bullet examples. To help clarify these concepts, you could provide more specific examples or analogies that illustrate the key principles of relative motion. For example, you could use a different example of an object moving in a different direction, such as a car turning a corner, to help students understand how to apply relative motion in different scenarios.
3. Offer more guidance on practice problems: Many students requested more examples and practice problems to help solidify their understanding of relative motion. To address this, you could provide more detailed explanations of how to approach practice problems, or offer additional resources such as video tutorials or online practice exercises. This will help students feel more confident in their ability to apply the concepts of relative motion to real-world scenarios.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the most common challenges they faced with relative motion were understanding the concept, determining velocities in different reference frames, and adding and subtracting vectors.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the most common challenges: While the summary mentions that relative motion was the most challenging topic, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the most common challenges that students faced, such as understanding when to add or subtract vectors, conceptualizing relative speed, and difficulty with the monkey and bullet examples.
2. Provide more specific examples: Instead of just mentioning that students requested more examples, provide specific examples of the types of problems that students found confusing, such as projectile motion with an angle of launch or relative motion with multiple velocities. This will give the instructor a better idea of what areas need more attention in future lectures.
3. Clarify the focus of the summary: The original summary mentions ""vectors and directions"" as the focused topic, but the summary itself covers a range of topics. To improve the focus of the summary, consider revising it to focus specifically on relative motion, such as ""The majority of students found relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture, with difficulty understanding when to add or subtract vectors and conceptualizing relative speed."" This will help the instructor quickly understand the main areas of concern without having to read through all of the individual reflections.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture, with the most common challenges being understanding when to add or subtract vectors, conceptualizing relative speed, and difficulty with the monkey and bullet examples. Specifically, students had trouble with the following:

* Understanding the arrangement of subscripts and variables in relative motion equations
* Difficulty with projectile motion when launched at an angle
* Confusion with the monkey and bullet examples
* Trouble with relative motion in 2-D

To better assist students in understanding these concepts, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of projectile motion with an angle of launch and relative motion with multiple velocities. Additionally, more explanation and practice problems are needed to fully grasp the concept of relative motion, particularly when it comes to understanding when to add or subtract vectors and conceptualizing relative speed."
86,"  SUMMARY: The majority of the students found the lecture on vector math to be clear and understandable, with a few areas of confusion. Some students struggled with the concept of subtracting vectors, adding vectors, and the use of unit vectors. Additionally, there was confusion about when to add or subtract vectors, and how to identify the direction of the resultant vector. Some students also requested more practice with unit vectors and more examples using them. Finally, a few students found the transition from the online lectures to the in-class examples to be smooth and efficient.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided responses and does not include any irrelevant information or suggestions.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","  Sure! Based on the provided reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students struggled with subtracting vectors, adding vectors, and the use of unit vectors, it would be helpful to prioritize these areas of confusion and provide more detail on what specifically caused difficulties. For example, you could mention that some students found it challenging to determine when to add or subtract vectors, or that they had trouble visualizing the direction of the resultant vector.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more concrete examples of the types of questions or concepts that caused confusion. For instance, you could mention specific questions or examples from the lecture that students struggled with, and provide more detail on what made them confusing. This would help to give a clearer picture of the areas where students need more support.
3. Offer more targeted suggestions for improvement: While the summary mentions that students requested more practice with unit vectors and more examples using them, it would be more helpful to provide more specific suggestions for how to address these areas of need. For example, you could suggest incorporating more practice problems with unit vectors into future lectures, or providing additional examples that illustrate how to use unit vectors in different contexts. This would give the instructor more concrete guidance on how to improve the lecture content to better support student learning.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the lecture on vector math was generally clear and understandable, but some areas of confusion were identified. The main challenges were with subtracting and adding vectors, understanding the purpose of unit vectors, and determining the direction of the resultant vector. To address these issues, the instructor could provide more practice with unit vectors, incorporate more examples using them, and emphasize the most common areas of confusion. Additionally, the transition from the online lectures to the in-class examples was smooth and efficient.

Here are three specific suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Prioritize the most common areas of confusion: The summary should focus on the areas that caused the most difficulty for the majority of students, such as subtracting and adding vectors, and the use of unit vectors.
2. Provide concrete examples: The summary should include specific examples of the types of questions or concepts that caused confusion, such as the Yeti problem or the use of unit vectors in different contexts.
3. Offer targeted suggestions for improvement: The summary should provide more specific suggestions for how to address the areas of need, such as incorporating more practice problems with unit vectors into future lectures or providing additional examples that illustrate how to use unit vectors in different contexts.

87,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the lecture on vectors and angles to be clear and well-explained, with a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were:

1. When to use sin and cos for x and y, and how to apply them correctly.
2. Understanding the concept of subtracting vectors and how to determine when to add or subtract them.
3. Difficulty with identifying scalars and vectors, and whether or not scalars need units.
4. Confusion with the direction of negative vectors and how they affect the resultant vector.
5. Trouble with visualizing the resultant vector and understanding its relationship with the addition vectors.
6. Difficulty with understanding when to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems.
7. Some students found the topic of unit vectors to be confusing, especially their purpose and how they are used.
8. A few students had trouble with the breakout rooms and getting used to using Top Hat.

Overall, the lecture was well-structured and easy to follow, but some students struggled with certain concepts and would benefit from additional practice and review.",Angles,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.

 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",88,"Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the last question was the most confusing, it would be helpful to specify which aspects of the question were confusing for the students. For example, was it the concept of friction on an incline, the combination of the two free body diagrams, or something else? By highlighting the most common sources of confusion, the instructor can target their explanations and examples more effectively.
2. Provide more examples of static friction: As several students requested more examples of static friction, it would be helpful to provide additional examples or practice problems that focus on this topic. This could include problems with different types of surfaces, angles, and forces to help students better understand how to apply the static friction coefficient.
3. Clarify the difference between push and pull: Some students were confused by the difference between push and pull in terms of force. To address this, the instructor could provide a clear explanation of the difference between these two types of forces and how they are treated in problems. Additionally, the instructor could provide examples that illustrate the difference between push and pull forces in different situations.

Here is the revised summary based on these suggestions:

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
 I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.",97,"I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging.

 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.

The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes.

1. Emphasize the key challenges: In the summary, highlight the main areas where students struggled, such as understanding when terminal velocity begins and ends, deriving the equations, and applying the concepts to real-world scenarios. This will help the instructor understand the specific areas that need more attention in future lectures or revisions.
2. Provide more examples and applications: Students requested more examples and applications to help them better understand the concepts. Consider providing additional examples of terminal velocity in different contexts, such as in sports or engineering, to help students see the practical relevance of the topic.
3. Clarify the relationship between centripetal force and circular motion: Many students struggled with the concept of centripetal force and how it relates to circular motion. Provide more explicit explanations of how centripetal force arises from the motion of an object in a circular path, and how it relates to the forces acting on the object, such as the normal force and the drag force.

Here is the revised summary incorporating these suggestions:

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the topic of Terminal Velocity to be challenging, with many expressing confusion over the concept itself, as well as the equations and examples used to illustrate it. Specifically, students struggled with understanding when terminal velocity begins and ends, deriving the equations, and applying the concepts to real-world scenarios. Additionally, students requested more examples and applications to help them better understand the concepts. To address these challenges, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and applications of terminal velocity, as well as more detailed explanations of the equations and forces involved, and to reinforce the relationship between centripetal force and circular motion.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Here are three key areas where students struggled:

1. Understanding when terminal velocity begins and ends: Many students were confused about the conditions under which terminal velocity occurs and how it is affected by changes in density and other factors.
2. Deriving the equations: Students had difficulty understanding how to derive the equations for terminal velocity and were confused by the units for each component of the drag force.
3. Applying the concepts to real-world scenarios: Students struggled with applying the concepts of terminal velocity to real-world examples, such as the example of the man hitting the water.

To address these challenges, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and applications of terminal velocity, as well as more detailed explanations of the equations and forces involved. Additionally, reinforcing the relationship between centripetal force and circular motion may help students better understand the underlying principles of terminal velocity."

 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
 N/A
 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the common themes of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the in-class activity and WDM to be confusing, it would be helpful to emphasize this further and provide more specific examples of the common themes of confusion. For instance, the summary could mention that many students struggled with understanding the difference between criteria and metrics, or that they found the instructions for the in-class activity to be unclear. This would help to provide a clearer picture of the challenges that the students faced.
2. Provide more specific recommendations for improvement: While the summary mentions that some students found the explanation of the WDM to be good, it would be helpful to provide more specific recommendations for how the instructor could improve the in-class activity and WDM explanation. For instance, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide more examples or illustrations to help students understand the concepts, or that they provide more guidance on how to fill out the decision matrix. This would help to provide actionable recommendations for the instructor to improve the course material.
3. Focus on the in-class activity and WDM: As the focused topic is the in-class activity and WDM, it would be helpful to focus the summary more on these topics and less on other aspects of the course. This could involve cutting out information about other topics that are not directly related to the in-class activity and WDM, and focusing more on the specific challenges and confusions that students faced with these activities. This would help to provide a more focused and targeted summary that is directly relevant to the instructor's needs.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the in-class activity and weighted decision matrix (WDM) to be confusing, with common themes of difficulty in understanding the difference between criteria and metrics, and how to fill out the decision matrix. Many students were also confused about the purpose of the WDM and its application in real-world scenarios. The instructions for the in-class activity were found to be unclear, and the due date for assignment 18 was confusing. However, some students appreciated the clarification on how the numbers worked in the WDM. To improve, the instructor could provide more examples or illustrations to help students understand the concepts, and provide more guidance on how to fill out the decision matrix. Additionally, the instructor could focus on providing more detailed explanations of the WDM and its application in real-world scenarios. Overall, the students found the in-class activity to be challenging and in need of more guidance and clarification."

 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.

 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.

131,"  SUMMARY:

The students found the first lecture to be helpful and interactive, with clear explanations and instructions. The BikeShare project was deemed sufficient in detail, and the breakout sessions were beneficial for getting to know classmates. However, some students experienced confusion with the CourseMIRROR app setup and the scheduling process. Additionally, there were questions about the due dates and assignments, particularly on Brightspace. Some students requested more information on the projects and quizzes, and clarification on the group formation and project assignments. The class dynamics, Brightspace, and Office 365 were well understood. Overall, the lecture was considered easy to follow, and the class provided a good grasp of the course's objectives.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system.

I found the assignment 12 to be fascinating 
We have worked a lot during the breakout room!
I really liked that we're applying real engineering practices now because it is very interesting
A12
I found it interesting how power could be calculated for the reservoir 
The time spent with my team during today's class was super helpful!!! 
I enjoyed using excel line charts to analyze the the instantaneous rate of change of the volume of the reservoir 
The reservoir power equation and A12 were very interesting to start on
the class quiz
 I enjoyed how we had a lot of time to work on our project for this upcoming week, I thought it could of used more explanation though.
 I liked being able to work with my team.
 Best fit lines are very interesting.
 I thought that finding all the different unit conversions for the acre-feet was interesting 
 I found the ability to apply things that we have done to solve for something tangible and comprehensible to be interesting.
 I thought the voter registration was most interesting in today's class

 I really liked the amount of time we had in breakout rooms to work on A12.
 Talking and communicating with my teammates
 nothing.

 Nothing stood out as it was mostly group work.
 Using math in class is getting interesting, more than just finding means, now we are using slope and instantaneous rate
 I liked getting to work in the breakout rooms, I feel like my team has a good understanding on the a12 assignment
 The most interest part of today's class was learning about the volumetric flow rate and how to calculate it of multiple intervals.
 I found it interesting how we are taking the slope and are going to change its units to get different values of Q.
 I liked how we talked about voting, bought awareness to it and I now know I can use my Purdue ID card.
 I liked that we got so much time to work with our team in class. It helped to get all of us on the same page.
 I thought that the fact that a12 was a continuation of a10 was interesting.

1. Emphasize the benefits of teamwork: While the original summary mentions that the students found the teamwork and breakout rooms aspect of the lecture to be engaging, it could be further emphasized. Consider adding a sentence that highlights the importance of teamwork in engineering projects, such as ""The students appreciated the opportunity to work in teams and apply real-world engineering practices, which is a crucial aspect of the course.""
2. Focus on the specific teamwork activities: Instead of mentioning ""breakout rooms"" generically, focus on the specific activities that took place in those rooms. For example, you could mention that the students worked on the A12 assignment, used Excel line charts to analyze data, or applied physics concepts to solve a tangible problem. This will help to paint a clearer picture of the teamwork activities that took place.
3. Use more specific language: To make the summary more concise and focused, use more specific language to describe the students' experiences. For example, instead of saying ""the ability to apply physics concepts to solve a tangible problem was also a highlight,"" you could say ""the students enjoyed applying physics concepts to design and optimize a real-world system.""

For example, ""The majority of students reported confusion regarding the feedback for Assignment 17, with many expressing frustration at not knowing how to proceed without having received feedback for Assignment 16.""
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the types of confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the number of ideas to generate for the project, the summary could provide an example of a specific student reflection that illustrates this confusion. This would make the summary more concrete and help the instructor better understand the issues that need to be addressed.
3. Focus on the instructor's role: The summary could be revised to focus more on the instructor's role in addressing the confusion. For example, the summary could suggest specific actions that the instructor could take to clarify the feedback process for Assignment 17, such as providing additional guidance on how to proceed without having received feedback for Assignment 16. This would help the instructor feel more empowered to address the issues that were raised in the reflections.

Overall, the suggestions should be based on the original reflections and focused on the topic of feedback. By emphasizing the main source of confusion, providing more specific examples, and focusing on the instructor's role, the summary can be more effective in highlighting the issues that need to be addressed and providing recommendations for improvement.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main source of confusion was the feedback for Assignment 17, with many students expressing frustration at not knowing how to proceed without having received feedback for Assignment 16.

The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that many students reported confusion over various aspects of the lecture, it would be helpful to highlight the most common sources of confusion. For example, the majority of students seemed to be confused about the number of ideas required for Assignment 17 and the iteration process. Emphasizing these areas could help the instructor focus their attention on addressing these specific issues.
2. Provide specific examples: The summary could benefit from providing specific examples of where the deliverables and instructions were unclear. For instance, instead of simply stating that the instructions for Part 5 were confusing, the summary could provide an example of what was confusing (e.g., the instructions were unclear on how to fill out the tables, or the criteria for what constitutes a good solution were not clearly defined). Providing specific examples can help the instructor understand the nature of the issues and make targeted improvements.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: While the summary mentions that the class was straightforward, it would be helpful to focus on the impact of the confusion on the students' learning experience. For example, the summary could mention how the confusion over the iteration process affected the students' ability to complete the assignment, or how the lack of clear instructions for Part 5 made it difficult for students to understand what was expected of them. Focusing on the impact of the confusion can help the instructor understand the significance of the issues and prioritize their attention on addressing them.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the deliverables and instructions for the current lecture were found to be unclear, particularly for Assignment 17. The majority of students reported confusion over the number of ideas required, the iteration process, and the feedback provided. Additionally, there was confusion over the use of biomimicry and the need for a prototype. To improve clarity, the instructor should emphasize the most common sources of confusion, provide specific examples of where the deliverables and instructions were unclear, and focus on the impact of the confusion on the students' learning experience.

Here are three specific suggestions to improve the deliverables and instructions:

1. Clearly define the number of ideas required for Assignment 17 and provide examples of what constitutes a good idea.
2. Provide more detailed instructions on how to complete the iteration process, including examples of how to fill out the tables and criteria for what constitutes a good solution.
3. Clarify the use of biomimicry and the need for a prototype, including providing examples of how to incorporate biomimicry into the design process.

By addressing these areas of confusion, the instructor can improve the clarity of the deliverables and instructions, enhance the students' understanding of the material, and improve their learning experience."

The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept and its application to the assignments. Specifically, students were confused about how to use the laminar approach for assignment A10 and found the instructions for the volume-height regression equation to be challenging. Additionally, some students were confused about the difference between SSE and SST, and the purpose of r and r^2 values.

Some students reported that the instruction on the laminar approach could have been more detailed and that they would have benefited from more explanation on the topic. Others expressed confusion about the assignment A11 and the due date for the in-class quiz.

Despite these challenges, many students reported that they enjoyed the class and found the explanation of the linear regression model to be helpful. However, it is clear that more clarification is needed on the laminar approach and its application to the assignments.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the types of confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the laminar approach, the summary could mention that students were confused about how to apply the laminar approach to specific problems or how to interpret the results. Providing more specific examples could help the instructor better understand the nature of the confusion and provide targeted solutions.
3. Focus on the focused topic: While the original reflections provide a wealth of information about the students' experiences, the summary should focus specifically on the laminar approach. To do this, you could revise the summary to only include comments that are directly related to the laminar approach. For example, you could exclude comments about the linear regression model or the assignment A11, as these topics are not part of the focused topic. By focusing on the laminar approach, the summary can provide a clearer picture of the students' understanding of this specific concept.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the lecture on the laminar approach was found to be confusing, with specific difficulties in understanding the concept and its application to the assignments.

149,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture to be clear and straightforward, with a few areas of confusion. The most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, specifically how to use it for assignment 10 and the difference between SSE and SST. Some students also found the instructions for assignment 10 to be confusing, particularly the part 5 with regression lines. Additionally, a few students were confused about the mathematical models and how to choose the surface area to start with.

There were also some requests for more explanation on certain topics, such as the laminar approach and the r-squared value. Some students suggested that going over assignments more in class would make the process clearer.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be helpful, but some clarification on certain topics would be beneficial.",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.

 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture to be clear, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion. For example, the summary could state that the most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, SSE and SST, and the regression lines in assignment 10. This will give the instructor a clearer understanding of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more specific examples of confusing topics: Instead of simply stating that certain topics were confusing, the summary could provide more specific examples of what was confusing. For instance, instead of saying that the laminar approach was confusing, the summary could state that students had difficulty understanding how to use the laminar approach to calculate the volume of an ellipse or how to use it for assignment 10. This will give the instructor a better understanding of the specific issues that need to be addressed.
3. Offer suggestions for addressing the confusion: The summary could also offer suggestions for how the instructor could address the confusion. For example, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide more examples of how to use the laminar approach or provide additional explanation on the difference between SSE and SST. This will give the instructor concrete actions they can take to improve the students' understanding.

I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main points: The summary should focus on the key points related to power calculation, such as the confusion about the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir and how to calculate volumetric flow rate. It should highlight the main areas where students need more clarity and support.
2. Provide more specific examples: Instead of general statements like ""more explanation on how to complete assignment 12,"" provide specific examples of what students need more clarity on, such as how to calculate the pressure head or how to use Excel for assignment 12. This will help the instructor understand the specific areas where students need more support.
3. Focus on actionable items: The summary should focus on actionable items that the instructor can use to improve the course, such as providing more information on how to prepare for the exam or clarifying the in-class activity. It should avoid general suggestions like ""make sure to bring this up in next class"" or ""consider this for future lectures."" Instead, it should focus on specific actions that the instructor can take to address the students' needs and concerns.

Here's an example of how the summary could be revised based on these suggestions:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main points: The majority of students reported that they did not find anything confusing in today's lecture on power calculation.

2. Provide more specific examples: Some students requested more information on how to complete assignment 12, specifically how to calculate the pressure head and how to use Excel. Provide specific examples and explanations on how to complete these tasks.
3. Focus on actionable items: A few students were confused about the in-class activity and whether there was one or not. Clarify the in-class activity and provide more information on how to prepare for the exam, such as providing previous exams or sample questions.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion in today's lecture on power calculation were related to the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir and how to calculate volumetric flow rate. Some students also requested more explanation on how to complete assignment 12, specifically how to calculate the pressure head and how to use Excel.

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the class to be clear and straightforward, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion. For example, the in-class assignment, the project instructions, and the open-endedness of Assignment 16 were the main sources of confusion. Emphasizing these points could help the instructor understand where to focus their attention when addressing future confusion.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that the project instructions were confusing, the summary could provide an example of a specific task that was confusing or a particular aspect of the project that was unclear. This would help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and provide more targeted feedback.
3. Focus on the project scope: The summary mentions that the project is broad and slightly confusing, but it would be helpful to provide more specific information about the scope of the project. For example, what specific aspects of the project are causing confusion? Are students having trouble understanding the problem statement, the requirements, or something else? Providing more specific information about the project scope could help the instructor tailor their feedback and support to address the specific needs of the students.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the majority of students found the class to be clear and straightforward, with a few areas of confusion. The most common sources of confusion were the in-class assignment, the project instructions, and the open-endedness of Assignment 16. Specifically, students were confused about the directions for the in-class assignment, the scope of the project, and the specific tasks they needed to complete by next class. To address these issues, the instructor should focus on providing clear and concise instructions, clarifying the project scope, and providing more specific examples of what is expected in Assignment 16. Additionally, the instructor should consider providing more information about the stakeholders and how to reach them, as well as clarifying the goal of the project and the specific tasks that need to be completed. By addressing these areas of confusion, the instructor can help ensure that students have a clear understanding of the project and can complete it successfully."

 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08

Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.

 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!

 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey.

 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
 I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering. 
 I liked being able to work in the breakout room.
 The projects looked interesting",222,"I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activityof drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting.

The in class assignment was confusing in what the task was and how to complete it.","  Sure! Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the reflections:

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students were confused about various aspects of the lecture and in-class activities, it would be helpful to highlight the most common sources of confusion. For example, the summary could mention that the most common sources of confusion were the in-class activity, the laminar approach, and the assignment explanations and descriptions. This would help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the types of confusion that students experienced. For example, instead of simply stating that the assignment explanations and descriptions were confusing, the summary could mention that students were unsure about which variables to use for the in-class activity or that they had difficulty understanding the instructions for the A10 assignment. This would provide more context and help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion.
3. Prioritize the suggestions: The suggestions should be prioritized based on their importance and frequency of occurrence. For example, if the majority of students were confused about the in-class activity, it would be more important to address that issue first. Additionally, the suggestions should be prioritized based on their potential impact on student learning. For example, if the confusion about the laminar approach is causing students to struggle with the assignments, it would be more important to address that issue than a minor issue with the assignment explanations and descriptions.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the most common sources of confusion during the lecture and in-class activities were the in-class activity, the laminar approach, and the assignment explanations and descriptions. Specifically, students were unsure about the requirements for the assignments, such as the two alternative mathematical methods and the models for the Taum Sauk tank. Additionally, students had difficulty understanding the pressure equation and the instructions for the A10 assignment. To address these issues, the instructor should focus on clarifying the assignment explanations and descriptions, providing more examples and context for the in-class activity and the laminar approach, and ensuring that the instructions for the A10 assignment are clear and concise. Prioritizing these suggestions based on their importance and frequency of occurrence will help improve student learning and understanding."

 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!

The students had mixed reactions to the lecture on Gasoline Density, with some finding it clear and well-explained, while others found certain aspects confusing. The majority of students found the in-class activity and the calculation of carbon emissions to be confusing, with some expressing confusion about the relevance of gasoline density in the activity. Some students also found the discussion of assumptions and how to communicate them to be confusing. However, many students appreciated the inclusion of environmental impacts and the emphasis on the importance of considering these in engineering developments. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and well-taught, with some areas for improvement in clarity and detail.",Gasoline Density," no
in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart.

 Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
 I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment. 
 There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
 I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth. 
 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.

It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","  Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary for the focused topic of Gasoline Density:

1. Emphasize the mixed reactions to the lecture: Instead of stating that the students had mixed reactions, consider emphasizing the contrasting opinions more explicitly. For example, ""The students had varying opinions on the lecture, with some finding it clear and well-explained, while others struggled with certain aspects."" This will help highlight the complexity of the students' experiences and provide a more nuanced understanding of the lecture's effectiveness.
2. Provide more specific examples of confusing aspects: While the summary mentions that certain aspects were confusing, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of what those aspects were. For instance, instead of simply stating that the in-class activity was confusing, provide an example of a specific question or problem that students struggled with. This will give the instructor a better understanding of where the students are struggling and what needs to be clarified.
3. Focus on the environmental impacts: The summary mentions that the students appreciated the inclusion of environmental impacts, so consider emphasizing this aspect more. For example, ""The students appreciated the emphasis on environmental impacts and the importance of considering these in engineering developments."" This will help highlight the relevance of the topic and provide a clearer focus for the summary.

Here's the revised summary based on these suggestions:

 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",321,"The z score was roughly explained
How probability and z score are related.
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
I am not sure about exactly what z value does
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normaldistributions so it would be great if you could go over those in moredetail.
I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I’m still not sure what it determines.
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel.
One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.

1. Emphasize the most common themes of confusion: Instead of listing all the individual topics that caused confusion, focus on the most common themes that emerged from the reflections. For example, you could mention that the majority of students struggled with z-scores, filling in missing data, and understanding the instructions for Assignment 08. This will help the instructor quickly identify the areas that need the most attention.
2. Provide specific examples of what students found confusing: Instead of simply stating that students found certain topics confusing, provide specific examples of what they found confusing. For example, you could mention that students were confused about how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example, or how to handle missing data in Excel. This will help the instructor understand the specific issues that need to be addressed.
3. Offer concrete suggestions for improvement: Instead of simply suggesting that the instructor provide more examples and detail, offer concrete suggestions for how the instructor can improve the course. For example, you could suggest that the instructor provide more practice problems on z-scores and probability, or offer additional resources such as video tutorials or online resources to help students better understand these concepts. This will help the instructor take specific action to address the issues that were identified.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

This will help the instructor better understand the nature of the students' confusions and provide more targeted guidance.
3. Focus on the most important points: The summary is quite long and covers a lot of ground. To make it more concise and focused on the Skittles Example, it might be helpful to prioritize the most important points and omit less essential information. For example, the summary could focus on the z-scores and the adjustment of the x-axis values, and omit the discussion of assignment A08, which is not directly related to the Skittles Example.

The students found the topic of Nature for Solutions/Biomimicry to be interesting and enjoyed learning about the various ways that nature can be used to create solutions to design problems. Many students found the quiz to be engaging and enjoyed the breakout group activities, where they could discuss differing approaches to finding solutions. The video on beetle research was also well-received, and students found the idea of using nature to create strong and resistant materials to be fascinating. Some students found the concept of biomimicry to be a bit confusing, but were still able to appreciate the interesting ways in which nature can be used to solve design problems. Overall, the students found the class to be engaging and informative, with a focus on the creative and innovative use of nature to solve real-world problems.",Nature for Solutions/Biomimicry,"It was interesting seeing how humans are making technology that mimics animals.
Something interesting was the quiz in class, I enjoyed it and think I did well. 
I liked learning about all the ways to create ideas in your head. 
It was interesting to finish the quiz and get it over with.
Nothing was that interesting in today's class. The topics discussed were neutral.
The breakout group time we had to work with out groups 
I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions 
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
What I found most interesting about today's class was how much processing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used to create a solution. 
I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.

I enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of beetle shells used to make very strong force resistant shells.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Nature for Solutions/Biomimicry:

1. Emphasize the main idea: The summary could be improved by focusing more on the main idea of the lecture, which is the use of nature as a source of inspiration for solving design problems. The current summary mentions several different topics, such as the quiz, breakout group activities, and the video on beetle research, but it could be more effective to focus on the central theme of biomimicry.
2. Use more specific language: Some of the language used in the summary is quite general, such as ""various ways that nature can be used to create solutions"" or ""differing approaches to finding solutions."" To make the summary more specific and focused on biomimicry, you could use language like ""students learned about the innovative use of nature to create solutions to design problems"" or ""explored the concept of biomimicry and its applications in design.""
3. Eliminate redundant information: The summary mentions several times that students found the class to be engaging and informative, but this information is already implied by the fact that they were participating in the class and completing the quiz. To make the summary more concise, you could eliminate these redundant statements and focus on the more specific information about biomimicry.

Here is the revised summary based on these suggestions:

The students reflected on the recent lecture and provided feedback on various aspects of the class. The majority of the students reported that they did not have any issues with the material covered in the lecture, and found the class to be straightforward. However, some students mentioned that they were confused about the calculations for the flow rate and how to determine the time intervals for part 6 of Assignment 12. Additionally, some students had trouble with the submission process for Assignment 10 and the Excel file for finding the flow rate. The students also expressed a desire for more clarity on how to calculate the power equation and the instantaneous flow rate. Overall, the students found the class to be productive and had a good understanding of the material.",Assignment 10,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
 The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
 Nothing was confusing in today's class, we had a lot of productive work time!
 I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn't that confusing
 I do not think anything in today's class was particularly confusing 
 I found nothing confusing about today's class
 We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
 How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
 Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.
 Nothing was confusing to me in class today.
 There wasn't much confusion with today's lecture. I thought our module quiz was so much easier to comprehend than the last one and make class easy to move through 
 I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
 The length of the time periods
 I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day. 
 The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
 My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn't.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?

 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",411,"The executive summary part of A16
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment
The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the majority of students found the lecture to be understandable, there were specific areas that caused confusion. To improve the summary, you could focus on the most common sources of confusion, such as the assignment details for Assignment 16, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the process of empathizing with users. This will help the instructor identify the areas that need more attention and clarification.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some students requested more details on how to study for the in-class quiz and how to identify users and clients. Providing specific examples or resources for these topics could help clarify the expectations and reduce confusion. For example, you could include a list of recommended readings or study materials for the quiz, or provide examples of different types of users and how to empathize with them.
3. Simplify the language and structure: Some students found the instructions unclear or overwhelming. To improve the summary, you could simplify the language and structure to make it easier to understand. For example, you could break down the assignment details into smaller, more manageable tasks, or use bullet points to highlight the key points. This will help students better understand the expectations and feel less overwhelmed by the workload.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections provided, the most common sources of confusion for Assignment 16 were the assignment details, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the process of empathizing with users. Some students also found the workload and short deadline to be overwhelming. To address these issues, the instructor could provide more specific examples and resources for studying for the in-class quiz and identifying users and clients. Additionally, the assignment details could be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and the language and structure of the instructions could be simplified to make them easier to understand. By addressing these areas of confusion, students will be better able to complete the project successfully and feel more confident in their understanding of the material."
219,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the topic of prototyping and testing to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding how to create and test their prototypes, especially when using CAD software. Some students were unsure of how to make their prototypes and test them virtually, while others were confused about the materials they could use. Additionally, there was confusion about the level of detail required in the prototypes and how to create a testing protocol. Some students found the discussion on the importance of prototyping to be helpful, but would have appreciated more examples of strong and weak experiments. Overall, the students expressed a need for more clarification on the specifications of assignment 18 and how to create and test their prototypes.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do.

 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room

 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
 I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don't have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.

Something confusing in today's class was the instructions for the new A17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on. 
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project. 
It was a very good class pretty productive got a lot of stuff done.
We went over each type of physical idea that could be made like bio mimicry. The concepts were a little confusing.
Nothing. The assignment made sense and what the goals of different perspectives and ideas play into finding a solution 
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
Nothing was confusing in today's class. Everything made sense that he was talking about in terms of idea generation and what was expected for the project.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic?
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
 I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
 I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don't have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.

 I did not find much confusing in class today. Most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. 
 Nothing was really confusing today. Everything was well explained and easy to understand
 It was difficult trying to come up with solutions that weren't already implemented by Purdue. 
 More information about the brainstorming process would be helpful to aid our team

Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Biotechnology/Bio mimicry:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the instructions for the new A17 assignment confusing, it would be helpful to specify which aspects of the assignment were confusing and provide more detail on what students would like to see clarified. For example, ""Some students found the instructions for the A17 assignment confusing, particularly the part on functional decomposition.""
2. Provide more specific examples of bio mimicry: The summary mentions that students were unclear about how to apply bio mimicry to the project, but it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of how bio mimicry can be applied to the design project. For example, ""Some students were unsure of how to apply bio mimicry to the project, but examples such as using nature-inspired materials or designing a system that mimics the structure of a leaf could help to illustrate the concept.""
3. Focus on the most common themes: While all the reflections are included in the summary, it would be helpful to focus on the most common themes that emerged from the reflections. For example, the theme of confusion around the instructions for the A17 assignment and the need for more information on how to apply bio mimicry to the project were mentioned by several students.

 Trade off designs were somewhat confusing but somewhat easy to grasp because it's a new concept to me.
 nothing was confusing
 What sources of electricity generation to use when finding carbon dioxide emissions for electricity. 
 nothing
 I wasn't confused on anything from today's class.
 This class wasn't confusing at all to me. The topics we discussed were interesting and straightforward, and working with my group in studio time was productive. 
 There was really nothing confusing in today's class, the in class activity and environmental/economic impacts fir assignment 13 were explained very clearly 
 How dropped grades factor into the midterm grade that is displayed 
 I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable.",418,"The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation’s other than to try to trip us up.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","  Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary for the focused topic of Gas Density:

1. Emphasize the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity: Many students were confused about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity. To address this, the summary could be revised to emphasize the importance of gas density in the design and development of engineering projects, and how it relates to the environmental impact and economic feasibility of the project.
2. Clarify the assumptions to be made in the project: Several students were confused about the assumptions to be made in the project and how to communicate them. To address this, the summary could be revised to provide more guidance on how to identify and communicate assumptions in the project, and how they relate to the environmental impact and economic feasibility of the project.
3. Provide more examples of how to calculate CO2 emissions: Some students were confused about the calculation of CO2 emissions and how to apply it to the project. To address this, the summary could be revised to provide more examples of how to calculate CO2 emissions and how to apply it to the project, with a focus on the relevance of gas density in the calculation.

Here's the revised summary based on the suggestions:

SUMMARY:

The students had mixed reactions to the in-class activity and the topic of gas density. Some found the calculations confusing, while others found the information to be straightforward. The majority of students were confused about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity and why it was included. However, most students found the information presented in class to be clear and well-explained, with a focus on the environmental impacts and economic feasibility of engineering developments. The topic of carbon emissions and the calculation of CO2 emissions was also a point of confusion for some students. To address these issues, the instructor could provide more examples of how to calculate CO2 emissions and how to apply it to the project, with a focus on the relevance of gas density in the calculation. Additionally, the instructor could emphasize the importance of gas density in the in-class activity and provide more guidance on how to identify and communicate assumptions in the project. Overall, the students had a good understanding of the topic, but could have benefited from more clarification on certain points.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the importance of group work: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found group work to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture, it could be further emphasized to highlight the value of collaboration in the design process. For example, the summary could state that students found the ""collaborative brainstorming and problem-solving"" aspect of the lecture to be the most interesting, or that group work allowed them to ""learn from one another and combine their ideas to create innovative solutions.""
2. Highlight the variety of prototyping methods: The summary could provide more details about the different prototyping methods discussed in the lecture, such as CAD modeling, 3D printing, and other materials and softwares. This could help to give a more comprehensive understanding of the prototyping process and the various tools and techniques available to students.
3. Include more specific examples of student engagement: While the summary mentions that students found the class discussion helpful and enjoyed working in breakout rooms, it could be more effective to include specific examples of student engagement. For instance, the summary could state that students were actively participating in the class discussion, asking questions, and sharing their ideas and thoughts with one another. This could help to give a more vivid picture of the learning experience and highlight the effectiveness of the group work approach.

Idea generation with my team","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Brainstorming ideas/creating solutions:

1. Emphasize the most relevant points: The summary could be shortened and made more focused by emphasizing the most relevant points, such as the use of biomimicry, idea iteration, and the breakout group time. This could be done by removing less relevant information, such as the mention of the quiz and the fact that the topics discussed were neutral.
2. Use more specific language: Some of the phrases used in the summary are quite general, such as ""the various methods and techniques discussed in class"" and ""differing approaches to finding solutions."" Using more specific language, such as ""biomimicry"" and ""idea iteration,"" would make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.
3. Use active voice: The summary is written mostly in passive voice, which can make it seem less engaging and less action-oriented. Using active voice, such as ""students enjoyed the breakout group time"" instead of ""the breakout group time was a highlight for many students,"" would make the summary more engaging and dynamic.

 nothing
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was are the exploring prior art supposed to be just general things being done or are they supposed to relate specifically to our ideas that we generated?
 Nothing was confusing in today's class! The in-class activity made a lot of sense and really helped us when generating ideas. 
 It was really confusing to follow what is expected from Assignment 17, I still don't fully understand what is expected of us.",426,"I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don’t drink coffee, so I didn’t really have much perspective for the problem.
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers

I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn’t have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would’ve been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information.
I was confused as to how indepth the pro’s and con’s diagram should be.
The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first.
The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.","  Sure! Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections:

1. Emphasize the common themes: While the reflections highlight various aspects of the class, there are some common themes that stand out. For example, many students found the in-class activity on pros and cons to be confusing, and some had difficulty understanding the context of the example given. You could emphasize these common themes in the summary to provide a clearer picture of the class's overall experience.

Suggestions: To improve the summary, you could focus on the common themes of confusion with the in-class activity and the unclear instructions for Assignment 17. You could also highlight the praise for the TAs' assistance and the overall productivity of the class.

2. Use more specific language: Some of the sentences in the summary are quite general, which makes it difficult to understand the specific issues that students faced. For example, ""some students found the instructions for Assignment 17 to be unclear"" could be rephrased as ""several students reported confusion about the requirements for the iteration section of Assignment 17.""

Suggestions: Use more specific language to describe the issues that students faced, such as ""several students reported confusion about the requirements for the iteration section of Assignment 17"" instead of ""some students found the instructions for Assignment 17 to be unclear.""

3. Provide more detail on the French press: The reflections mention that some students were confused about the French press and its difference with a Keurig. Providing more detail on this aspect could help to clarify the issue and give a better understanding of the class's experience.

Suggestions: You could add a sentence or two to explain the French press and its difference with a Keurig, such as ""Some students were confused about the French press, which is a type of coffee maker that uses a steeping process to brew coffee. It differs from a Keurig, which uses individual coffee pods to brew coffee."" This would help to clarify the issue and provide a better understanding of the class's experience.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the in-class activity on pros and cons was a common source of confusion, with some students struggling to understand the context of the example given. Additionally, the instructions for Assignment 17 were found to be unclear, particularly with regards to the requirements for the iteration section. Some students were also confused about the difference between a French press and a Keurig. However, most students found the class to be productive and the in-class activity to be helpful. The TAs were praised for their assistance. Overall, the class was found to be straightforward and clear, with only a few minor issues with the assignment requirements and the in-class activity.

To improve understanding, the lecture could emphasize the key differences between black and red node deletion, provide more visual aids for the rotations, and simplify the language used to describe the node deletion methodology.

Here are the three key points that the revised summary focuses on:

1. Differences between black and red node deletion: The summary highlights the distinct strategies for handling black and red nodes in the tree, such as the color flip and the different rotation techniques used for each case.
2. Rotation concepts: The summary provides more visual aids and examples to illustrate the left and right rotations, and explains the reasoning behind the rotation techniques to maintain the Red-Black tree properties.
3. Simplified language: The summary uses simpler language to describe the node deletion methodology, such as ""deleting a node with two child nodes"" instead of ""deleting a node with two children.""

By focusing on these three key points, the revised summary provides a clearer and more concise overview of the topic of RB BST/Red-Black tree/red-black BST/Red Black BST, addressing the students' needs for further clarification on the rotations and node deletion methodology."

1. Emphasize the key takeaway: Instead of summarizing all the points, focus on the most important takeaway from the lecture, which is that Red-Black BSTs have a worst-case runtime of O(log n) for all operations. This can be done by starting the summary with a sentence that highlights this key point, such as ""The students have learned that Red-Black BSTs have a worst-case runtime of O(log n) for all operations, making them an efficient data structure for searching and inserting elements.""
2. Use concrete examples: The students have mentioned that they have seen how the insertion states transition between each other until the tree is corrected. To make the summary more concrete, you could provide an example of how this works, such as ""For example, when inserting a new node, the tree may start in an unbalanced state, but through a series of rotations, the tree is corrected to maintain a balance between red and black nodes.""
3. Avoid repetition: The summary mentions ""rotations"" twice, which can make it feel repetitive. To avoid this, you could combine the two mentions of rotations into one sentence, such as ""The students have learned about the rotations used to maintain a balance between red and black nodes, which are essential for the O(log n) worst-case runtime of Red-Black BSTs.""

Figuring out how to do the main function
I was confused on the coding for V0","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Coding:

1. Emphasize the main challenges: Instead of mentioning all the areas of confusion, focus on the main challenges that the students faced while coding in MATLAB. For example, you could highlight the difficulty in pinpointing and correcting errors in the data, and the confusion about how to call subfunctions with the right columns of data selected. This will give the instructor a clearer picture of the students' struggles and help them tailor their future lectures and support.
2. Use specific examples: To make the summary more concrete, provide specific examples of the coding challenges the students faced. For instance, you could mention a particular function or line of code that caused confusion, or provide an example of how the students struggled to select the right columns of data for the subfunctions. This will help the instructor understand the specific issues the students are facing and provide targeted support.
3. Focus on the learning objectives: To keep the summary focused on the topic of Coding, you could revise it to emphasize the learning objectives covered in the lecture. For example, you could mention the importance of understanding how to write subfunctions, how to select the right columns of data, and how to use smoothing techniques to reduce noise in the data. This will help the instructor understand what the students have learned and what they still need to work on.

Here's the revised summary with these suggestions:

 opening the files
 Some things that were confusing was opening the files for the assignments, but that was expected. Someone eventually helped me out.     However, something else I think would be useful is a calendar with all the due dates for upcoming assignments. For example if it included the pre-class videos and assignments.
 Initially struggled with running a p file, got it once it was explained.
 At first, it was kind of confusing how to download the link and access certain files on the matlab desktop app. The TAs were very helpful if you asked for help, though. 
 It would be helpful if you could go over how we save the text in our command window if there is a way to do that so we can go back to work on code later if needed.
 Just explaining things a bit slower, I would look down at my laptop to follow along and when I would look back at the screen you would already be 3 steps ahead. My whole table was very lost as you were explaining.
 The wording on a submission text-box made it confusing as to whether we should submit the command alone or include the result.
