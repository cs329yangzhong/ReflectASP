The students had mixed understanding of the Shell Theorem and Coulomb's Law in today's lecture. Some found the diagrams confusing, while others had trouble with the math steps in the examples. The concept of grounding and the idea of charge remaining in a particle after it has been grounded were also unclear to some students. However, the majority of students found the lecture well-explained and enjoyed the breakout rooms.

Some specific areas of confusion included the second shell theorem, the ratio of charges, and the example with the two particles repelling each other. Some students also had trouble understanding why the lightbulb lit up due to the work done by the professor.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be good, but some areas could be clarified to improve understanding.",Shell Theorem/Coulomb's Law,"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the lecture well-explained, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion. For example, the second shell theorem, the ratio of charges, and the example with the two particles repelling each other were identified as confusing. Emphasizing these areas can help the instructor focus on addressing these points in future lectures.
2. Clarify the concept of grounding: Some students had trouble understanding the concept of grounding and how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded. Providing additional examples or explanations on this concept can help clarify this important aspect of Coulomb's Law.
3. Use more specific language when discussing the lightbulb example: The reflection mentions that some students had trouble understanding why the lightbulb lit up due to the work done by the professor. To avoid confusion, it may be helpful to use more specific language to describe this example, such as ""the lightbulb lit up due to the transfer of energy from the professor's hand to the lightbulb through the wire."" This can help students better understand the concept of work and energy in the context of Coulomb's Law.

I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.

Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Electric/Uniform Field:

1. Emphasize the specific challenges with dipoles in a uniform field: Instead of mentioning ""calculating moments"" as a general challenge, focus on the specific issues students had with dipoles, such as understanding how dipoles work in a uniform field and the second-to-last example being confusing. This will help the instructor target their clarification and examples more effectively.
2. Clarify the physical properties of the electric field: Students seemed to have difficulty understanding the physical properties of the electric field, such as its relationship to electric force. The instructor could provide more examples or explanations to help students grasp these concepts better.
3. Provide more examples or illustrations for simple charge distributions: Students struggled with the simple charge distributions and the math behind certain numbers being considered 0. Providing more examples or illustrations can help students better understand these concepts and how to apply them in practice.

I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on.

 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors

 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.
 The most interesting and helpful part of the video lecture were showing all the different types of vectors problems that will be present.",55,"I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into thebreak out rooms.

56,"  SUMMARY:

The man and pulley example was a challenging topic for many students, with several common areas of confusion. These included understanding the concept of two tensions in the pulley system, difficulty with setting up free body diagrams, and confusion about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. Some students also found it difficult to understand how tension is multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem and how to solve for a variable in the equation. Additionally, some students struggled with understanding the principles behind the doubling of the force in the pulley system and the concept of internalized forces. Finally, some students found the last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice to be confusing.

Overall, the topic of the man and pulley example was a challenging one for the students, with many struggling to understand the concepts and set up the free body diagrams. The instructor may want to consider providing additional examples and explanations to help clarify these concepts and make them more accessible to the students.",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

The students also struggled with understanding the relationship between tension and the man's weight in the pulley system and the source of the two tension vectors in the free body diagram. To address these areas of confusion, the lecture could benefit from more specific examples of how free body diagrams are applied in real-world situations, such as calculating the force required to lift a heavy object or determining the acceleration of a car on a frictionless surface. Additionally, the lecture could use clearer language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible, and key terms and concepts should be defined and explained more thoroughly to help the students better understand the material."

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of tension in free body diagrams, particularly when it comes to multiple tension forces and the relationship between the force of tension and the acceleration of an object. Some students found the examples and questions to be challenging, especially the ones involving pulleys and multiple objects. The students also had trouble understanding how to set up free body diagrams and how to determine the forces acting on an object.

 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.

 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

The students found the topic of centripetal force problems to be engaging and interesting, with many highlighting the real-life applications and the connection to their prior knowledge of circular motion. The discussion of terminal velocity and drag force was particularly well-received, with many students finding it fascinating that acceleration can occur even when velocity is constant. The examples of extreme acceleration due to terminal velocity, such as jumping from an airplane into water, were also well-liked. The students appreciated the inclusion of relatable examples, like Pokémon and Minecraft, to help illustrate the concepts. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and enjoyable, with a focus on centripetal force problems that deepened their understanding of circular motion.",Centripetal force problems,"I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting
What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

79,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the dinosaur question to be confusing, with issues arising from the direction of acceleration, the use of positive and negative directions, and the need to combine the accelerations of multiple dinosaurs. Some students also had trouble with the concept of keeping track of negative and positive values. Additionally, a few students found the calculus-based content to be challenging, especially when it came to the use of derivatives. Finally, some students had difficulty distinguishing between average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration.

However, the majority of students found the lectures to be clear and well-explained, with some students commenting that the examples and practice problems were helpful in reinforcing the concepts. Overall, the students seemed to have a good understanding of the material, but may have benefited from additional practice with applying the kinematic equations to real-world situations.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value

The majority of students found relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept of relative speeds, direction, and the use of vector addition and subtraction. The monkey problem was particularly confusing for some students, with issues arising from the equations set up and the use of tangents to determine the final velocity. Additionally, students struggled with relative motion in 2D and the use of reference frames. To address these struggles, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples and clarification on the most common areas of confusion, such as the monkey problem and relative motion in 2D, and use clear and concise language to ensure that the instructor understands the students' struggles and can address them effectively.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

2. Provide more specific examples and clarification: Many students requested more examples and practice problems to help reinforce their understanding of relative motion. Providing specific examples and clarification on the most common areas of confusion, such as the monkey problem, could help address these requests and improve student comprehension.
3. Use clear and concise language: Some students mentioned that the lecture went too quickly, and they had difficulty keeping up with the material. Using clear and concise language in the summary, and avoiding technical jargon or complex terminology, could help ensure that the instructor understands the students' struggles and can address them effectively."
85,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture. Many struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion, and some found it difficult to conceptualize relative speed, especially when objects are launched at an angle. The monkey and bullet examples were also confusing for some students, with some requesting more explanation on the equations used to solve these problems. Additionally, some students had trouble with the concept of reference frames and determining velocities from different perspectives. However, the majority of students found the lecture to be helpful and felt that the examples and explanations provided cleared up any confusion. Overall, students would like more practice problems and examples to help solidify their understanding of relative motion.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
 Tension forces 
 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
 Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.",85,"This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, focusing on the topic of angles:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the difference between scalars and vectors: Some students found it difficult to identify scalars and vectors, which can lead to confusion when working with angles. Consider adding more examples or practice problems to help students understand the difference between these two concepts.
2. Provide more examples of how to use unit vectors: Unit vectors can be helpful in solving problems involving angles, but some students found it confusing when to use them and how to apply them. Consider providing more examples of how to use unit vectors in different situations, and emphasize their importance in solving problems.
3. Clarify when to add or subtract vectors: Some students had trouble with the concept of subtracting vectors, and found it difficult to determine when to add or subtract vectors. Consider adding more examples or practice problems that illustrate when to use addition and subtraction with vectors, and provide clear explanations of when each method is appropriate.

Overall, the suggestions should focus on addressing the specific areas of confusion mentioned by the students, while also emphasizing the importance of understanding the fundamental concepts of vectors and angles. By doing so, the students will be better prepared to succeed in the course and avoid confusion in future lectures.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the lecture on vectors and angles was generally clear and understandable, but some areas of confusion were identified.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle.

93,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the topic of Two Blocks/Forces/Systems to be challenging, with many expressing confusion over the conceptual questions and the use of friction in the problems. Some students reported difficulty in understanding how to combine the forces of multiple blocks and how to determine the force needed to move one block on top of another. The last problem of the lecture, involving two blocks on a frictionless surface, was particularly confusing for many students. However, some students reported that the interactive lectures and the use of example problems helped to boost their confidence in understanding the material.

Some common areas of confusion included:

* Understanding the difference between push and pull forces
* Determining the force needed to move one block on top of another
* Combining the forces of multiple blocks
* Using friction in the problems
* Understanding the concept of fsmax and how it is used to overcome friction

Some students requested more examples and practice problems to help reinforce their understanding of the material, particularly in regards to static friction and the use of the static friction coefficient. Additionally, some students expressed confusion over the purpose of fsmax and how it is used in problem-solving.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",93,"When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.

I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.","  Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the importance of practice with Free Body Diagrams: Many students mentioned that they found the topic challenging and would benefit from more practice. Providing additional practice problems or examples in class, or encouraging students to work on their own with online resources, could help reinforce their understanding of FBDs.
2. Clarify the difference between push and pull forces: Some students were confused about the difference between push and pull forces, and how to represent them in FBDs. Providing clear definitions and examples of each type of force, and how they are represented in diagrams, could help alleviate this confusion.
3. Break down complex problems into simpler ones: Many students found it difficult to understand how to combine forces in FBDs when dealing with complex problems. Breaking down these problems into simpler ones, and providing step-by-step solutions, could help students build their understanding of how to use FBDs to solve more complex problems.

Overall, the suggestions should focus on providing more practice and clarification on key concepts, as well as breaking down complex problems into simpler ones to help students build their understanding of Free Body Diagrams.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections provided, the main areas of difficulty for the students in the lecture on Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) were:

1. Combining forces in FBDs, particularly when multiple forces are applied.
2. Understanding the difference between push and pull forces and how to represent them in FBDs.
3. Solving problems with more than one object or surface using FBDs.

To address these challenges, the following suggestions are recommended:

1. Provide more practice with static friction and how to use the static friction coefficient in problem-solving.
2. Offer clear definitions and examples of push and pull forces, and how they are represented in FBDs.
3. Break down complex problems into simpler ones, and provide step-by-step solutions to help students build their understanding of how to use FBDs to solve more complex problems.

By implementing these suggestions, students will have a better understanding of how to use Free Body Diagrams to solve problems with more than one object or surface, and how to combine forces in a clear and concise manner."

To better support student understanding, more examples and applications of drag force in circular motion could be provided, and the importance of terminal velocity could be emphasized. Additionally, more explanation on the relationship between drag force and centripetal force could be given to help students better understand how these two forces interact in circular motion.

Specifically, students had trouble with the following aspects of drag force:

* Understanding when to substitute drag force equations
* Combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions
* The effect of density on terminal velocity
* The units for each component of drag force
* The relationship between drag force and centripetal force

To address these challenges, the lecture could benefit from more examples and applications of drag force in real-world situations, such as in the design of roller coasters or water slides. Additionally, more explanation on the relationship between drag force and centripetal force could be given to help students better understand how these two forces interact in circular motion. Finally, the importance of terminal velocity could be emphasized to help students understand its significance in the context of drag force."

It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it

 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project
 Looking at assignment 13, the economic part is confusing
 Nothing was confusing 
 Today's class was great!! Nothing needed clearing up!
 nothing

 The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
 The class was not confusing because we did not go over a whole lot of information
 Everything seemed straight forward in glass today. If I do get confused I will look back at the slides and recording. 
 Nothing
 Nothing, the description of how power is generated differently around the world was very good.
 Nothing was confusing in this class.
 There was nothing confusing in class today.
 It was impossible to find what was due today in bright space so i missed the quiz that was due today.

The most efficient way to do A13
The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13.
It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the newassignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteriain assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused.
Looking at assignment 13, the economic part is confusing
I did not understand the assignment in its entirety.","  Sure! Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary for the focused topic of Assignment 13:

1. Emphasize the common themes of confusion: While the majority of students reported that they did not find anything confusing, there were some common themes that emerged, such as confusion about the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the process of creating charts for the project. The summary could be improved by highlighting these common themes and providing more specific information on how to address them.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some students requested more information on how to approach the project, particularly in regards to finding information on the public library's emissions and economic information. Providing more specific examples of where to find this information or how to access it could help clarify the assignment and reduce confusion.
3. Clarify the purpose of the in-class activity: Some students were confused about the in-class activity, specifically whether they were supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online. Clarifying the purpose of the activity and providing more specific instructions could help reduce confusion and ensure that students understand what is expected of them.

Here is the revised summary incorporating these suggestions:

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.

The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Shareproject will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the nextlecture.
he only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3.
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade.
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing.
However, I’m somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing inthe first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
Maybe more details in the CATME assignments.
Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually.In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester?
When will we be starting the first project?","  Sure, here are three suggestions for improving the generated summary based on the student reflections:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the common themes of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found Assignment 17 to be confusing, it would be helpful to further emphasize the specific themes of confusion that emerged from the reflections. For example, the reflections mention confusion about the need for 8-12 solutions, the iteration section, and the feedback on Part 5. Emphasizing these common themes can help the instructor understand the specific areas where students are struggling and provide targeted support.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For example, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the iteration section, the summary could provide an example of a specific question or issue that students had. This can help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and provide more targeted support.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: Finally, the summary could benefit from a discussion of the impact of the confusion on the students' learning experience. For example, the summary could mention whether the confusion led to frustration, delays, or other negative consequences. This can help the instructor understand the broader implications of the confusion and provide support to mitigate any negative effects.

Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models.

 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.

 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture straightforward, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion. For example, the summary could state that the laminar approach, SSE and SST, and assignment A10 were the most common sources of confusion. This will give the instructor a clearer picture of where to focus their attention when addressing student concerns.
2. Provide more specific examples of confusion: Instead of simply stating that the explanation of the regression data was rushed, the summary could provide more specific examples of what was confusing. For instance, students may have been confused by the difference between SSE and SST, or how to calculate the regression constant value. Providing specific examples will help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and address it more effectively.
3. Include a suggestion for additional in-class coverage: Based on the reflections, some students were confused about the expectations for the in-class quiz and the due date for assignment A11. To address this, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide additional in-class coverage on these topics to clarify any misunderstandings.

The majority of students found the lecture to be clear and understandable, with a few areas of confusion. The most common areas of confusion were related to the laminar approach, specifically how to use it for Assignment 10 and the difference between SSE and SST. Some students also had difficulty with the volume-height regression equation and the trendline in Excel. Additionally, some students were confused about the instructions for Assignment 11 and the due date.

Overall, the class seemed to be well-understood, but a few areas could be clarified to help students better understand the material.",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

For instance, instead of just mentioning that the instructions for the in-class activity were a bit confusing, you could provide an example of what specifically caused confusion, such as the lack of detail in the instructions or the ambiguity of the activity itself.

Focus on the instructor's role in addressing confusion: While the reflections mention that the instructor's explanation and breakout room session helped to clarify the expectations and tasks for Assignment 16, it would be helpful to emphasize the instructor's role in addressing the remaining confusion.

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the project instructions and expectations confusing, it would be helpful to specify which aspects were most confusing. For example, the summary could mention that the majority of students were confused about the scope of the project, specifically what is required for the first part of the assignment and how to research their residents and end users. This will help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the types of confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the open-endedness of assignment 16, the summary could mention that some students were unsure about how to approach the problem-scoping aspect of the assignment or how to determine the appropriate level of detail for their responses. This will help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and provide targeted guidance.
3. Focus on the project-related confusion: While the reflections mention other aspects of the lecture that were confusing, the summary should focus specifically on the project-related confusion. This means that the summary should exclude references to other aspects of the lecture that were not related to the project. By focusing on the project-related confusion, the summary will provide a clearer picture of the specific challenges that students faced and help the instructor prioritize their efforts to address these challenges.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.

I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.

The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
 I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that several students found the in-class assignment confusing, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the most common sources of confusion, such as the laminar approach and the diagram submission. This will give the instructor a clearer picture of where to focus their attention.
2. Prioritize the suggestions: Some of the suggestions, such as ""more explanation on the laminar approach"" and "" clearer instructions on the in-class assignment"" are more important than others. It would be helpful to prioritize these suggestions to ensure that the instructor addresses the most critical issues.
3. Provide specific examples: To make the summary more actionable, it would be helpful to provide specific examples of what the instructor could do to address the sources of confusion. For example, instead of simply suggesting ""more explanation on the laminar approach,"" the summary could suggest ""providing a step-by-step example of how to use the laminar approach to calculate the volume of the reservoir.""

Here is the revised summary based on these suggestions:

 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.

1. Emphasize the need for more clarification on the laminar approach and mathematical models: Many students reported confusion on these topics, suggesting that more explanation and examples are needed to better understand the material. The summary should highlight this issue and suggest ways to address it, such as providing more examples or clarifying the instructions for Assignment 10.
2. Provide more examples of how to simplify the diagrams: Students found it confusing to simplify the diagrams, and more examples or guidance on how to do this would be helpful. The summary should suggest providing more examples or exercises in class or in the form of additional resources, such as a tutorial or video.
3. Clarify the instructions for Assignment 10: Several students reported confusion on the instructions for Assignment 10, including what types of models are necessary and how to create them. The summary should suggest clarifying the instructions and providing more guidance on what is expected for the assignment.

Here is a revised summary based on these suggestions:

SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the in-class assignment and the laminar approach to be confusing. Specifically, they had difficulty understanding how to create mathematical models in Excel and how to simplify the diagrams. Some students also reported confusion on the instructions for Assignment 10 and the due dates for certain assignments. To address these issues, the instructor should consider providing more examples of how to simplify the diagrams and clarifying the instructions for Assignment 10. Additionally, the instructor may want to provide more explanation and examples on the laminar approach and mathematical models to better understand the material.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the in-class assignment and the laminar approach to be confusing, specifically struggling with creating mathematical models in Excel and simplifying diagrams. Assignment 10 instructions and due dates for certain assignments also caused confusion. To address these issues, the instructor should provide more examples of simplified diagrams, clarify Assignment 10 instructions, and offer more explanation and examples on the laminar approach and mathematical models. This will help students better understand the material and complete assignments with confidence."

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the majority of students found the lecture clear, a few mentioned confusion about creating prototypes for abstract ideas and using 3D design programs. To improve the summary, you could highlight these areas as the main sources of confusion and provide a brief overview of how they were addressed in the lecture.
2. Clarify the weighted design matrix: Some students were confused about the weighted design matrix, so you could clarify in the summary that the matrix was explained in detail and any confusion was addressed by the TA. This will help to provide a clearer understanding of the topic and alleviate any misunderstandings.
3. Focus on the in-class activity: The in-class activity was mentioned in several reflections, but it is not clear what the activity entailed. To improve the summary, you could focus on the in-class activity and provide a brief overview of what students did during the activity, such as ""Students worked on creating prototypes for their projects during the in-class activity.""

Overall, the class found the information to be straightforward, but with a few areas for improvement in terms of clarity and guidance.",Assignment 10 / A10 / A010,"I think that the class today was executed well and I'm starting to understand the class in a greater depth. 
More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates
 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren't talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don't really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
 I found nothing confusing. 
 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today's class. As we've now reached the fourth week of class, I've adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don't think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn't find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
 the new project
 The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment. 
 There wasn't anything too confusing in today's class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.",241,"The different parts of A010 that were due when
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
Due date for Assignment #10
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the class was generally understandable, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas where students experienced confusion. For example, the summary could mention that students were confused about the due dates for assignments, the milestones for A10 and A12, and the mathematical/physical models for A10. This will help the instructor identify the areas where they need to provide more guidance or clarification.
2. Provide more specific suggestions for improvement: Instead of simply stating that students requested more guidance on how to complete the mathematical/physical models for A10, the summary could suggest specific ways in which the instructor could provide this guidance. For example, the summary could suggest that the instructor provide more examples or demonstrations of how to complete the models, or that they provide additional resources or support for students who are struggling with the models.
3. Use more specific language to describe the students' reflections: The summary uses relatively vague language to describe the students' reflections, such as ""a few areas of confusion"" and ""some students requested more details."" To provide a more accurate picture of the students' experiences, the summary could use more specific language to describe the nature of the confusion and the specific requests that students made. For example, the summary could say that ""several students were confused about the due dates for assignments"" or ""several students requested more guidance on how to complete the mathematical/physical models for A10.""","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the class was generally well-executed and understandable, with a few areas of confusion regarding specific concepts and assignments. The main areas of confusion were the due dates for assignments, the milestones for A10 and A12, and the mathematical/physical models for A10. Students requested more guidance on how to complete these models and how to cite sources in APA format. To improve the class, the instructor could provide more specific examples or demonstrations of how to complete the models, offer additional resources or support for students who are struggling, and clarify the due dates and milestones for assignments and projects. Additionally, the instructor could provide more information on how to cite sources in APA format to avoid confusion and ensure academic integrity."

 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing

 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture clear, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion. For example, the summary could mention that parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 were confusing, and that students had difficulty understanding the laminar approach. This will help the instructor to focus their attention on these areas when providing additional support.
2. Provide more detail on the sources of confusion: Instead of simply stating that students were confused about the in-class activity and the instructions for assignment 10, the summary could provide more detail on what specifically caused the confusion. For example, the summary could mention that students were unsure about how to properly cite sources, or that they had difficulty understanding the information literacy section. This will help the instructor to identify the root causes of the confusion and provide targeted support.
3. Offer suggestions for improvement: Finally, the summary could offer suggestions for how the instructor could improve the lecture to address the areas of confusion. For example, the summary could suggest providing more examples or explanations of the laminar approach, or offering additional support on how to properly cite sources. This will help the instructor to take action to address the areas of confusion and improve the learning experience for students.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help

183,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the calculation of payback period and capital investment to be the most interesting aspect of today's lecture. Many students appreciated the simplicity of the formula and the ability to apply it to real-life examples. Some students found the in-class activity and breakout rooms to be helpful in understanding the concept. Additionally, the discussion on how companies determine whether an investment is worthwhile or not was found interesting by some students. Overall, the students found the topic of payback period and capital investment to be engaging and informative.",Payback Period/Payback Time,"I found the calculation for how to find how long it will take for the company to get their investments back to be the most interesting.
Discussion with my peers 
capital investments and determining whether investment is good or bad
I actually found the capital investment formula to be very interesting in today's class.
that it was very simple to find the payback period. 
Nothing really stuck out in today's class. It was just the usual with a new formula to calculate with.
The breakout groups. Not that the large class discussion isn't interesting I just found the time for the breakout groups helped the group figure out what we have to do
Learning the specifics of how energy expenses are economically impactful was interesting. 
I doing interesting the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced. This equation will definitely help my team during the project and we are able to see and understand how the factors relate. 
I found it interesting that companies have a capital investment payback period for upgrades on their products.
 I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting. 
 What I found most interesting about today's class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses. 
 That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
 I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
 The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.
 I found the payback time interesting and working more in groups on the project
 Something I found most important in today's class was the description on how group work should be assigned and completed. Making sure everyone is on the same page and everything has clarity was something I found necessary to explain to the class. 
 I found the in class activity very interesting and it helped us to understand what we need to do for Assignment 13. Also, the breakout rooms are extremely helpful and my team and I get a good amount of work finished. 
 The different types of energy usage 
 I thought our time in breakout rooms working on the assignment was the most interesting. The time in class is greatly appreciated.
 Today's most Interesting thing was learning more about how the different types of energy are use, how much they cost and how it all works.
 I was interested in the example used for the in-class activity because it somewhat pertained to a job that I had previously worked.
 I found it really interesting that companies are able to take into consideration the amount they're saving per unit in order to determine the payback time 
 Something interesting was the in-class activity, it was fun being able to learn how to solve for a payback period because it is cool to apply it to a real life example. 
 I found learning how to calculate the payback period interesting because when looking at the assignment I was intimidated by the concept. After practicing how to do it I feel a lot more confident.
 The equation introduced for payback was very interesting and explained well

Many students were intrigued by the idea of exploring different energy sources and the real-world applications of the projects. The class discussion on energy conversion units and the various forms of energy generation were also found to be interesting. Additionally, the new project on analyzing energy usage for the Indianapolis Library was seen as a valuable opportunity to consider economic and environmental factors. Overall, the students found the topic of Energy Generation to be informative and enjoyable.",Energy Generation ,"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
All the different forms to make energy 
one thing that was interesting was that only 23 percent of energy production reaches consumers. 
The process by which companies or buildings have to think about which process to use to generate energy and the various positive and negative consequences that come from each possibility.
I liked to read the backgroung information for the next assignment 
Solar panels
I found the premise of analysing multiple affects of our task and then balancing those aspects to be enjoyable.
I like how the assignment requires our group to actually make a design decision based on our data rather than just manipulate data for the sake of manipulating data.
The new project that we were assigned today was very interesting. I'm looking forward to finishing it with my group members. 
How solar panels can be used to produce energy.
 The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project. I am interested in energy use and all of that kind of stuff, so I was interested in starting this next project.
 I found the production of energy from solar panels very interesting because the way energy can be produced for electricity is amazing to me.
 I found it interesting how only 34% of source energy was delivered to customers as electricity, meaning we still have plenty of room for improvement when it comes to increasing efficiency. 
 One thing that was interesting about today's class was how the location of a building has such a huge impact on the payback of solar energy. 
 Something I found most important in today's class was the focus on units and their overall impact on calculations and results. Making sure to outline their importance prior to giving us the project helped us understand what to expect and what is being asked of us.

196,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on probability and z-scores to be confusing, with specific issues including:

* Confusion about how to calculate z-scores and their relationship to standard deviation
* Difficulty understanding the concept of z-scores and how they are used in data analysis
* Confusion about the assignment expectations for A08, including what data to use and how to handle missing data
* Difficulty with the skittle example, particularly with regards to switching the x-axis to a percentage
* Need for more practice with probability and z-scores
* Confusion about the instructions for A05 and what data to use for the assignment
* Difficulty with the breakout rooms and lack of clarity on what to do during the in-class activity

Several students also mentioned that more details and examples would be helpful for understanding the concepts and completing the assignments.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

3. Offer additional practice: Several students requested more practice with probability and z-scores. Offering additional practice exercises or providing resources for students to practice outside of class can help reinforce the concepts and build confidence."
197,"  SUMMARY:

The main topics of discussion in today's lecture were statistics and probability. The students had a few questions and concerns regarding the topics, which can be summarized as follows:

* The concept of z-scores and how to calculate them was confusing for some students.
* The process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles was unclear.
* The instructions for Assignment 08 were confusing, specifically regarding the ""new data"" tab.
* Some students had trouble understanding how to handle missing data in Excel for Assignment 8.
* The explanation for how to adjust the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages was not clear.
* Some students found the z-score information confusing and would have liked more examples and practice with the concept.

Overall, the students had a good understanding of the topics, but would have benefited from more clarification on a few points.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","  Sure! Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections and focused topic:

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: Based on the reflections, it appears that the Skittles Example was a topic that caused the most confusion among students. To improve the summary, you could emphasize this by starting with a sentence that highlights the main sources of confusion, such as ""The Skittles Example was a topic that caused significant confusion among students, with many struggling to understand the concept of z-scores and how to calculate them.""
2. Provide more specific examples of what students found confusing: Instead of simply stating that students found certain concepts confusing, you could provide more specific examples of what they found confusing. For example, you could mention that students struggled with understanding how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the Skittles example, or that they had difficulty with the assignment instructions and expectations for each part. This will give the instructor a better understanding of the specific areas where students need more clarification.
3. Focus on the most important suggestions: There were several suggestions made by students, but some were more important than others. To improve the summary, you could focus on the most important suggestions, such as providing more practice with probability and standard distribution of data, and clarifying the assignment instructions and expectations for each part. This will help the instructor prioritize the most critical areas that need improvement.

Here's an example of how the summary could be improved based on these suggestions:

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
 Going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out. 
 It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
 working with my team on our project ☺️
 The application of ideas and models
 The ideas that our group came up with 
 exploring pros and cons
 What I found most interesting about today's class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians. 
 The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment.

1. Emphasize the significance of carbon emissions: While the reflections mention the topic of carbon emissions, it would be helpful to emphasize its significance in the summary. For example, the summary could highlight the importance of reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, or the impact of carbon emissions on human health and the environment.
2. Focus on the in-class activity: The in-class activity on calculating car carbon footprint was a popular aspect of the lecture, and the summary could benefit from highlighting this activity. The summary could describe the activity in more detail, such as how the students calculated their car's carbon footprint and what they learned from the experience.
3. Use more specific language: To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of carbon emissions, it would be helpful to use more specific language. For example, instead of using ""the environment,"" the summary could use ""climate change"" or ""carbon emissions"" to emphasize the specific topic being discussed. Additionally, instead of using ""design trade-offs,"" the summary could use ""trade-offs in reducing emissions"" to provide more context.

 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",411,"The executive summary part of A16
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.

* Offer suggestions for addressing the confusion, such as providing more examples or explanations of the criteria and constraints, or offering additional support for students who are struggling with the assignment.

Original Summary:

The majority of students found the lecture to be understandable and easy to follow, with few confusing aspects. The main areas of confusion were related to the assignment details for Assignment 16, specifically the criteria and constraints, and the difference between problem scoping and previous assignments. Some students also found it difficult to identify users and clients, and would have appreciated more time spent on empathizing with different users. Additionally, some students were confused about the project goalposts and the amount of work to be completed in a short amount of time.

Regarding Assignment 16, students were confused about the specific sections due, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the workload being unexpectedly large. Some students also found the survey of the public to be a lot of work.

Overall, the lecture was well-planned, and the professor's explanations helped to clarify any confusion. However, some students would have benefited from more details on certain topics, such as how to study for the in-class quiz and how to empathize with users.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion in the lecture were related to the assignment details for Assignment 16, specifically the criteria and constraints, and the difference between problem scoping and previous assignments.

219,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the topic of prototyping and testing to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding how to create and test their prototypes, especially when using CAD software. Some students were unsure of how to make their prototypes in-depth and how to test them virtually. Additionally, there was confusion on how to approach prototype making and how to determine the level of detail required for the prototypes. Some students also found the discussion on testing protocols to be unclear and would have benefited from examples of strong and weak experiments. Overall, the students are looking for more clarification on the specifications of assignment 18 and how to create and test their prototypes.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

To make the summary more focused, you could emphasize this theme and highlight the specific challenges that students faced during the class, such as confusion about the instructions for the A17 assignment and difficulty understanding how to apply bio mimicry to the project.
2. Use specific examples: To make the summary more engaging and informative, you could use specific examples from the reflections to illustrate the challenges that students faced. For example, you could mention that some students were confused about how to apply bio mimicry to their designs, or that others had difficulty understanding the scope of the project and when specific parts were due.
3. Focus on the most important points: The original summary covers a lot of ground, but some points are more important than others. To make the summary more concise and focused, you could prioritize the most important points, such as the challenges with groupwork and brainstorming, and omit less important details. For example, you could omit the mention of the technical brief and focus more on the challenges with the A17 assignment and bio mimicry.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Many students struggled with groupwork and brainstorming during the class, particularly with understanding the instructions for the new A17 assignment and applying bio mimicry to their designs. Some were unsure of the scope of the project and when specific parts were due. To improve the class, more time could be spent on creating a functional decomposition chart and clarifying the project's scope. Overall, students were interested in learning more about brainstorming and how to apply bio mimicry to their designs.

The reflections highlight the following specific challenges:

* Confusion about the instructions for the A17 assignment
* Difficulty understanding how to apply bio mimicry to the project
* Uncertainty about the scope of the project and due dates for specific parts

By focusing on these common themes and using specific examples, the summary provides a clear and concise overview of the challenges that students faced during the class."

Something confusing in today's class was the instructions for the new A17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on. 
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project. 
It was a very good class pretty productive got a lot of stuff done.
We went over each type of physical idea that could be made like bio mimicry. The concepts were a little confusing.
Nothing. The assignment made sense and what the goals of different perspectives and ideas play into finding a solution 
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
Nothing was confusing in today's class. Everything made sense that he was talking about in terms of idea generation and what was expected for the project.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic?
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
 I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
 I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don't have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.
 I think it was a little confusing how biomimicry could be used for this project. There wasn't really any relevant example provided for how we could use it.
 I did not find much confusing in class today. Most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. 
 Nothing was really confusing today. Everything was well explained and easy to understand
 It was difficult trying to come up with solutions that weren't already implemented by Purdue.

There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","  Sure! Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary for the focused topic of Gas Density:

1. Emphasize the importance of gas density in the lecture: While the students generally found the lecture to be clear, some mentioned that they would have liked more information on the topic of gas density. To address this, you could emphasize the importance of gas density in the lecture and provide more examples of how it is used in engineering applications. This could help students understand the relevance of the topic and why it is important to understand it.
2. Clarify the relationship between the in-class activity and the environmental analysis: Some students were confused about how the in-class activity related to the environmental analysis. To address this, you could provide more context on how the in-class activity fits into the larger picture of the environmental analysis. For example, you could explain how the calculations from the in-class activity will be used in the environmental analysis and why they are important.
3. Provide more examples of how to calculate CO2 emissions and the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period: Some students were unsure about how to calculate CO2 emissions and the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period. To address this, you could provide more examples of how to perform these calculations and explain the reasoning behind them. This could help students understand the process and feel more confident in their ability to perform the calculations.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the lecture was generally found to be clear and well-explained, with a few areas of confusion. The topic of gas density was not a source of confusion for the students. However, some students were confused about the in-class activity and how it related to the environmental analysis. Additionally, some students were unsure about how to calculate CO2 emissions and the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period. To address these areas of confusion, emphasis could be placed on the importance of gas density in the lecture, the relationship between the in-class activity and the environmental analysis could be clarified, and more examples could be provided on how to calculate CO2 emissions and the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and well-taught, with a few areas for clarification."

SUMMARY: Students reflected on learning about Red-Black BSTs, focusing on the worst-case runtime of O(log n) for all insertion and deletion operations. They observed the importance of maintaining the balance of the tree, with a total of black edges to any leaf node being the same. During insertion and deletion, temporary violations of the RBBST conditions may occur, but the tree transitions between insertion states to correct the tree and maintain the balance. The RBBST conditions ensure that the tree remains balanced and the worst-case runtime is achieved.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Students reflected on learning about Red-Black BSTs, focusing on the worst-case runtime of O(log n) for all insertion and deletion operations.

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that students had mixed understanding of the material, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the areas that caused the most confusion. For example, instead of saying ""some were confused about the difference between M1a and M1,"" the summary could say ""students struggled with the distinction between M1a and M1, and the need for references for Milestone 1."" This will help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that require the most attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary mentions that students were confused about the questions in Milestone 1, but it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of what those questions were and why students found them confusing. For instance, the summary could say ""students had difficulty understanding how to approach the questions in Milestone 1, particularly question X and question Y, which were found to be confusing due to [specific reason]."" This will give the instructor a better understanding of the specific issues that need to be addressed.
3. Focus on the most important suggestions: The original summary includes several suggestions for improvement, but some of them may not be as important as others. To make the summary more focused on Milestone 2, it would be helpful to prioritize the most important suggestions and eliminate any that are less relevant. For example, the summary could omit suggestions related to the structure of the project and instead focus solely on the issues related to Milestone 2. This will help the instructor quickly understand the most critical issues that need to be addressed.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with finding vmax for graphs and the distinction between M1a and M1, with some confusion on the need for references for Milestone 1.

1. Emphasize the most important points: The summary should focus on the most important points from the reflections, which are the in-class demonstrations and their impact on understanding the concepts of resonance, phasors, and the relationships between inductors, capacitors, and resistors. The other points, such as the visual representations of waves and the use of an oscilloscope, are important but not as central to the topic.
2. Use more specific language: Instead of using general terms like ""visual representations"" and ""practice problems,"" use more specific language to describe the demonstrations and activities, such as ""sin wave demonstrations"" and ""phasor manipulation."" This will help to paint a clearer picture of the in-class activities and their impact on student learning.
3. Focus on the most engaging aspects: The summary should highlight the most engaging aspects of the in-class demonstrations, such as the use of an oscilloscope to demonstrate resonance and the changing oscillating ammeter. This will help to give a sense of what made the demonstrations particularly effective and memorable for the students.

1. Emphasize the hands-on approach: The students consistently mentioned that the in-class problems and demonstrations were helpful in understanding the concepts. To make the summary more concise, you could focus on the hands-on aspect of the in-class problems and how they helped the students understand the material. For example, you could say that ""The students found the hands-on in-class problems and demonstrations to be particularly helpful in understanding resonance, phasors, and graph manipulation.""
2. Highlight the key concepts: While the original summary covers a range of topics, it would be helpful to focus on the key concepts that the students found most interesting or challenging. For example, you could highlight the relationship between Z and R at resonance, the concept of current leading or lagging the emf, and the use of an oscilloscope to find the resonant frequency. By focusing on these key concepts, the summary can be more concise and informative.
3. Use more specific language: Some of the sentences in the original summary are quite general, which can make it difficult to understand what the students are referring to. To make the summary more specific, you could use more technical language and specific examples to illustrate the students' reflections. For example, instead of saying ""the demonstration of the graphs,"" you could say ""the demonstration of the sinusoidal graphs of the circuit's voltage and current."" This will help to make the summary more precise and informative.
