I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface
More examples would be helpful for further understanding. 
Figuring out what Gaussian surface to draw in problems 
I was not too confused but the field lines of the right angle planes question for the quiz was confusing. 
Nothing was too confusing. The only part I found a little difficult was the different gauss fields around the uniformly charged inner sphere. Just transitioning from one layer to the next for me slightly confused in your last example problem video.
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this.

Magnetic field lines and  multiloop circuits 
 The rc time unit was interesting. 
 I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered! 
 How you can split up multi loop circuits into separate branches 
 I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
 It was neat how we used the very basic loop rule to build up to a separable differential equation that solves q(t).
 I thought it was interesting how we have never been able to create a magnet with the same poles. Especially since it has the possibility to be useful for technology. 
 It's interesting how electrons move in circular motion around a magnetic field. Also it is interesting how many times we use the cross product. 
 I found it interesting that magnetic fields are so similar to electric fields.
 I think it is interesting how the graphs of charging and discharging a capacitor are able to tell us a lot

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.

Students had difficulty understanding the concepts of electric fields and dipoles in a uniform field, with specific confusion regarding the physical properties of the electric field and how dipoles interact with it. Some students found the tophat questions challenging, particularly those related to dipoles in a uniform field. Additionally, some students requested more time to absorb the information after practice problems and a review of potential energy of dipoles. Finally, a few students expressed confusion about the directions of electric fields and forces, as well as dipole moments.",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.

Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and helpful in understanding the topic of problem solving and picking equations in kinematics.",Problem Solving or Picking Equations,"Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same.
I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school.

The students found the projective problems, specifically the monkey and hunter problem, to be the most interesting and engaging part of the lecture. They appreciated the visual aids, such as the videos and FBD drawings, that helped them understand the concepts better. The students also enjoyed the group work and breakout rooms, which allowed them to collaborate and learn from one another. The topic of projectile motion was found to be particularly interesting, as it showed how separate the x and y components are and how the horizontal and vertical motions are independent. The students also appreciated the real-life applications of projectile motion and how it can be used to solve problems in different scenarios. Overall, the students found the lecture to be informative and engaging, with the projective problems being the most standout aspect.",Projective Problems,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

56,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of double tension in the man and pulley example. They found it challenging to visualize the two tension forces acting on the man and how they were related to the force he exerted on the rope. Some students also struggled with the idea of doubling the force of tension when the man pulled himself up on the pulley. Additionally, the free body diagrams for the man and the three blocks problem were confusing for some students, and they had trouble understanding how to set up the diagrams and solve the problems. However, the students generally found the lecture easy to understand and appreciated the clear explanations provided.

To address these challenges, the instructor may consider providing more examples and visual aids to help students visualize the double tension concept and how it relates to the force exerted by the man on the rope. Additionally, the instructor may want to review the free body diagrams and provide more practice problems to help students become more comfortable with setting them up and solving problems involving multiple forces.",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

Additionally, the instructor could provide more explanation and examples of how multiple tension forces work together, and provide more practice with problems that involve multiple tension forces. Finally, the instructor could provide more guidance on how to set up free body diagrams and how to identify the different forces acting on an object."
59,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of tension and how it is represented in free body diagrams. Specifically, they were confused about why the tension force is represented as a positive force, even though it is a force that is exerted by one object on another. Some students also struggled with the idea of double tension in pulley systems and how it relates to the force needed to hold the man still. Additionally, the students had trouble understanding how to set up free body diagrams for problems involving multiple objects and how to determine the forces acting on each object. Finally, some students found the examples and questions in the lecture to be challenging and would have benefited from more conceptual or harder examples.

 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual.

 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

1. Emphasize the right-hand rule more: While the majority of students found the right-hand rule to be confusing, it is a crucial concept in understanding the direction of vectors in 2D and 3D space. Consider adding more examples or practice problems that focus specifically on the right-hand rule, especially in 2D space.
2. Provide more visual aids: Many students had trouble visualizing the right-hand rule on a 2D graph and needed more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.

78,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture to be clear and informative, with helpful explanations and practice problems. However, some students struggled with the right-hand rule and visualizing 3D objects on paper. Additionally, some students had trouble with the cross product and determining the direction of the result. Some students also found the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs to be confusing.

Specifically, students had difficulty with:

* Understanding the right-hand rule and how to apply it to 3D objects
* Visualizing 3D objects on paper
* Determining the direction of the result when using the cross product
* Understanding how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration
* Interpreting position, velocity, and acceleration graphs

To address these issues, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and practice problems, as well as more detailed explanations of the right-hand rule and the cross product. Additionally, providing more information on how to visualize 3D objects on paper and how to interpret position, velocity, and acceleration graphs may be helpful.",General TopHat Issues,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

The majority of students found the dinosaur question and the concept of acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D to be challenging. Some students had difficulty understanding the direction of acceleration and the use of kinematic equations. Additionally, there was confusion about the right hand rule and the difference between average and instantaneous velocity. Some students found the examples and explanations helpful, while others suggested that more practice problems and examples would be beneficial. Overall, the students seemed to understand the material, but had some difficulty with the application and clarity of certain concepts.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

For example, the summary could mention that many students struggled with determining direction relative to different perspectives, applying vector addition and subtraction in relative motion, and understanding the equations used in the Monkey Problem.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some students mentioned that they had difficulty with the Monkey Problem and the concept quiz questions. Providing more specific examples of these questions and how they can be solved could help clarify the concepts for the students.
3. Clarify the reasoning behind subtracting vectors instead of adding: Some students mentioned that they were confused about the reasoning behind subtracting vectors instead of adding them in relative motion. Providing a clear explanation of this concept and why it is important could help students better understand the topic.

Here's the revised summary based on the suggestions:

85,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture. Specifically, they struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion, and had difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, especially when objects are launched at an angle. Some students also found the monkey and bullet example problem confusing, and requested more examples and explanations to help them better understand the concept. Additionally, a few students expressed confusion about the arrangement of subscripts and variables in relative motion equations, and the reasoning behind subtracting vectors instead of adding them. Overall, students felt that more explanation and practice problems are needed to fully grasp the concept of relative motion.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
 Tension forces 
 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
 Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.",85,"This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.

86,"  SUMMARY: Today's lecture on vector math covered topics such as adding and subtracting vectors, using unit vectors, and the right-hand rule. Some students found the concept of subtracting vectors to be confusing, while others had trouble with identifying when to add or subtract vectors based on the question. The lecture also introduced the topic of unit vectors and their role in vector math. Students expressed a need for more practice with adding and subtracting vectors geometrically and using unit vectors. Additionally, some students were confused about when to add or subtract vectors and how to identify the direction of the resultant vector. Overall, the lecture was clear and thorough, but some students may benefit from additional practice and review of the material.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

Here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections and the focused topic of angles:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and provide additional examples or practice problems to help students master this concept.
2. Clarify the purpose of unit vectors and provide more examples of how they are used in real-world applications. This could help students better understand the significance of unit vectors and how to identify them.
3. Consider adding more visual aids, such as diagrams or animations, to help students visualize the concepts of vector addition and subtraction. This could help to reduce confusion and improve understanding of the material.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the summary and provide more targeted support for the students in their understanding of vectors and angles.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the lecture on vectors and angles was generally well-received, with a few areas of confusion. The majority of the students found the lecture clear and well-explained, but some struggled with the concept of subtracting vectors and identifying scalars and vectors. To address these areas of confusion, it may be helpful to provide additional examples and practice problems to reinforce the concept of vector addition and subtraction, clarify the purpose of unit vectors, and provide more visual aids to help students visualize the concepts.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.

When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",93,"When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.

 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams

 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension

 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.

 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity

 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.

The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
How metrics were different than criteria","  Sure! Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic criteria:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the confusion around the criteria and metrics sections of the weighted decision matrix: While the majority of students found the explanation of the weighted decision matrix to be clear, there was significant confusion around the criteria and metrics sections. To improve the summary, you could focus on this specific area and provide more detail on what specifically caused the confusion (e.g., the difference between criteria and metrics, how to determine the appropriate metrics for each criterion, etc.).
2. Highlight the inconsistency in understanding the in-class activity: Several students mentioned that they were confused about the in-class activity, specifically the portion where they had to complete a decision matrix. To improve the summary, you could emphasize this inconsistency and suggest ways to clarify the instructions or provide more guidance in the future (e.g., providing a detailed example or demonstration, clarifying the expectations for the in-class activity, etc.).
3. Provide more detail on the challenges with finding sources for cost of production and testing prototypes: While some students mentioned that they had difficulty finding sources for cost of production and testing their prototypes, others did not mention this issue. To improve the summary, you could provide more detail on what specifically caused the challenges (e.g., the lack of resources, the complexity of the topic, etc.) and suggest potential solutions (e.g., providing additional resources, breaking down the topic into smaller parts, etc.).

By focusing on these three areas, you can create a more concise and focused summary that highlights the main issues and challenges faced by the students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the most common areas of confusion were the criteria and metrics sections of the weighted decision matrix, the in-class activity, and finding sources for cost of production and testing prototypes. Specifically, students had difficulty distinguishing between criteria and metrics, understanding the expectations for the in-class activity, and sourcing information for cost and prototype testing. To address these challenges, the instructor may consider providing more detailed explanations of the criteria and metrics, clarifying the expectations for the in-class activity, and offering additional resources for finding cost of production and testing sources."
109,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the in-class activity and weighted decision matrix (WDM) to be confusing, with specific issues including the unclear instructions, confusion between criteria and metrics, and difficulty understanding how to complete the WDM. Some students also found the difference between criteria and metrics to be confusing, and a few were confused about how to test their prototypes. However, some students found the explanation of the WDM to be good and the class to be clear overall.

The main areas of confusion for the in-class activity were the criteria and metrics sections of the WDM, and the lack of clear instructions on what to do for the activity. Some students also found the xsl file format and the text at the bottom of the page to be confusing.

Overall, the students found the in-class activity and WDM to be challenging and would have benefited from more explanation and clarification on the instructions and how to complete the activity.",In-Class Activity or In-Class Assignment," nothing

In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project
 Looking at assignment 13, the economic part is confusing
 Nothing was confusing 
 Today's class was great!! Nothing needed clearing up!
 nothing

 The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
 The class was not confusing because we did not go over a whole lot of information
 Everything seemed straight forward in glass today. If I do get confused I will look back at the slides and recording.

The majority of students found today's lecture to be straightforward and clear, with no confusion. However, some students reported minor confusion on specific topics such as the in-class activity, the criteria and constraints of Assignment 13, and the difference between criteria and constraints. Some students also requested more information on how to approach the project, specifically on finding information for the public library's emissions and economic information. Additionally, a few students expressed confusion on the energy units and the conversion process. Overall, the students found the class to be well-executed and appreciated the clear explanations provided.",In-Class Activity,"I was not confused about anything

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part

 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.

 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?

The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.","  Sure! Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the majority viewpoint: While some students reported minor confusion, the majority found the lecture to be straightforward and clear. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic, you could emphasize this majority viewpoint and highlight that the class was generally well-understood.
2. Clarify the specific areas of confusion: Instead of simply stating that some students were confused about specific topics, you could clarify what those topics were. For example, you could mention that some students were confused about the in-class activity, the criteria and constraints of Assignment 13, and the difference between criteria and constraints. This would provide more detail and help the instructor understand the specific areas where students may need additional support.
3. Provide more specific suggestions for improvement: Instead of suggesting that the instructor ""provide more information"" or ""cover more"" specific topics, you could provide more specific suggestions for improvement. For example, you could suggest that the instructor provide more examples of how to approach the project, or provide more information on the public library's emissions and economic information. This would give the instructor more specific guidance on how to improve the class.

The majority of students found the calculations for CO2 emissions to be confusing, specifically the conversion for the in-class activity and the difference between the slides in Brightspace and the in-class presentation. Some students also had issues with finding the correct numbers for the assignments. However, the students generally found the class to be straightforward and enjoyed the clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions. The in-class activity was a common source of confusion, with some students finding the values on the slides to be different from the answers provided. Additionally, some students were confused about the environmental portion of Assignment 13. Overall, the students found the class to be well-executed and enjoyed the clarification on the calculations for CO2 emissions.",CO2 Emission Calculations,"I understood everything
The way to do the calculations of the carbon emissions was confusing and I did not know where to find the numbers.
There was nothing confusing in today's class. It all made sense and was presented well.
The value of the grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline needed more accuracy from the slide in class to the slide for the in class activity.
nothing
The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing 
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today's class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
 I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
 I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
 I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well. 
 The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
 I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
 For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number. 
 I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
 Nothing was confusing today.
 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.

 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward. 
 I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the calculations for CO2 emissions were confusing, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the main sources of confusion. For example, the discrepancy between the slides in Brightspace and the in-class presentation, the conversion for the in-class activity, and the difficulty in finding the correct numbers for the assignments. This will help the instructor identify the areas that need more attention and clarification.
2. Provide more context for the environmental portion of Assignment 13: Some students were confused about the environmental portion of Assignment 13. Providing more context or examples of what this portion entails could help clarify the assignment and reduce confusion.
3. Use specific examples to illustrate the confusion: Instead of just stating that the in-class activity was confusing, provide specific examples of what was confusing. For example, mention that the values on the slides were different from the answers provided, or that some students were unsure about how to convert the units for the in-class activity. This will help the instructor understand the nature of the confusion and provide targeted solutions.

Some students had trouble accessing CourseMIRROR and requested a calendar with due dates for assignments. Additionally, some students requested more information on the project's organization and how it will work. The students were generally satisfied with the class dynamics and the Brightspace platform. However, some students expressed confusion about the scheduling process and the weekly class schedule. Overall, the students found the first lecture to be helpful and informative, with a few minor areas for improvement.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects andquizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know rememberwhat to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, soif more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might helpthose students.
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Shareproject will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the nextlecture.
he only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3.
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade.
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing.
However, I’m somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing inthe first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.

Focus on the specific aspects of group work that were most engaging: Instead of just mentioning that the students found group work to be helpful, the summary could delve deeper into the specific aspects of group work that they found most engaging. For example, it could mention how the students enjoyed brainstorming ideas with their teams, or how the process of problem scoping was particularly interesting. This would give the reader a better sense of what made the group work experience so valuable for the students.
3. Use more descriptive language to bring the reflections to life: The summary could benefit from more descriptive language that brings the students' reflections to life. For example, instead of simply stating that the students found the design process interesting, the summary could describe the process as ""engaging"" or ""challenging."" This would help the reader better understand the students' experiences and perspectives.

it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17 because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outline document. Jeff was able to clear it up at the end
I think it could have been nice to do the weighted decision matrix, and actually do ine as a in-class activity
How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer! 
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards. 
 The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
 Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.
 Im super confused on the project we are doing. My group and kept asking questions. I think everything else was straight forward. 
 You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.
 I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
 how to fill out the tables in assignment 17 correctly 
 I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete. 
 The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
 It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
 Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
 I thought that class was rather straightforward, however I had trouble finding bio imitation ideas for the project.
 I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thought we needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
 It would have been nice to have mor information on how to generate prototypes using biomicry.
 I was confused about which parts were due on Friday for the project and felt like it wasn't very clear what our team was supposed to do and turn in.
 I'm confused on if i have to cite my sources for pictures i took myself.
 nothing
 Trying to find what all was due in class 10b
 Nothing, the explanation of idea generation was clear and informative.
 I found the most confusing part to be the pros and cons list about each coffee maker as I am unsure of what they were since I don't really drink coffee.
 There was no confusing portion of the class
 I did not feel confused by anything from today. 
 It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class. 
 when assignments are due
 I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
 What a french press is
 The most confusing part today was which sections of the assignment were ur on Friday
 There was nothing confusing today.
 A17
 nothing
 I was confused about the need for 8 to 12 solutions 
 Biomimicry was a little confusing 
 Part 5, the iteration section
 The in class activity  
 The feedback on A12 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing
 A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn't been graded yet so my group doesn't know how to do an assignment before the information required has been provided.
 The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it

A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.","  Sure! Based on the reflections, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that students had mixed reactions to the lecture and assignment, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the main sources of confusion. For example, the summary could mention that students were confused about the number of ideas to generate, the pros and cons list, and the iteration process. This will help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the pros and cons list, the summary could provide an example of a specific question that a student asked, such as ""How do we determine the pros and cons of each idea?"" This will help the instructor better understand the nature of the confusion and provide more targeted feedback.
3. Focus on the impact of the confusion: Finally, the summary could benefit from a discussion of the impact of the confusion on the students' learning experience. For example, the summary could mention that the confusion about the assignment's requirements led to frustration or confusion, or that the lack of clarity on the iteration process made it difficult for students to complete the assignment. This will help the instructor understand the broader implications of the confusion and take steps to address them.

Overall, the suggestions above will help the instructor better understand the specific challenges that students faced with Assignment 17 and take targeted steps to address them, improving the learning experience for all students.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion for Assignment 17 were the unclear requirements, specifically the number of ideas to generate, the pros and cons list, and the iteration process. Students were also unsure about the project's scope and what was due on Friday. Additionally, some students found the biomimicry concepts confusing. The class found the in-class activity helpful, but requested more information on how to complete the assignment. The confusion caused frustration and difficulty in completing the assignment.

To address these issues, the instructor should provide more clarity on the assignment's requirements, specifically the number of ideas to generate and the pros and cons list. Additionally, the instructor should provide more information on how to complete the iteration process and clarify the project's scope. Finally, the instructor should consider providing more examples or explanations of the biomimicry concepts to help students better understand the topic. By addressing these areas of confusion, the instructor can improve the learning experience for all students and help them complete the assignment successfully."

The students found the carbon footprint calculations and activity to be the most interesting part of the lecture. They were surprised by the high carbon footprint of their own lifestyles and the impact of individual choices on the environment. The website that calculated the number of earths needed if everyone lived like them was found to be interesting, as well as the before and after pictures of climate change. The class also enjoyed working on the solar panel project and found the in-class activity on CO2 produced by cars to be informative. The discussion on ethics in engineering and the responsibility of engineers to reduce carbon emissions was also found to be interesting. Overall, the students gained a better understanding of their own carbon footprint and the impact of their choices on the environment.",Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity,"Solar panel specs
I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later. 
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about. 
 I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
 That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
 I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13. 
 I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.
 I liked looking at the carbon footprint website today! It was really interesting!

147,"  SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be confusing, with many expressing difficulty in understanding the concept and how to apply it to the assignments. Some students reported confusion on the difference between SSE and SST, and the use of r and r^2 values. Additionally, some students found the instructions for assignment A10 to be unclear, and requested more explanation on the task at hand. However, some students reported that the lecture was clear and they had no confusion. The main points of confusion were the laminar approach, the difference between SSE and SST, and the instructions for assignment A10.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture confusing, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the main sources of confusion. For example, the reflections mention that students were confused about the laminar approach, the difference between SSE and SST, and the instructions for assignment A10. Emphasizing these points in the summary can help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: Some students reported that they were confused about how to apply the laminar approach to the assignments. Providing more specific examples of how to use the laminar approach in the context of the assignments could help clarify the concept for these students. Additionally, providing examples of how to calculate SSE and SST could help students understand the difference between these two measures.
3. Offer additional resources or support: Some students reported that they were confused about the assignment instructions and requested more explanation on the task at hand. Offering additional resources or support, such as a video tutorial or a review session, could help address these concerns and reduce confusion.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.
 when assignment a11 is due and what our in class quiz is on
 SST and SSE

 I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear. ",207,"The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that aresimilar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that the majority of students found the lecture to be clear, it would be helpful to highlight the specific areas that caused confusion, such as the laminar approach, volume-height regression equation, and assignment A10. This will give the instructor a clearer understanding of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more specific examples of requested explanations: Instead of simply stating that students requested more explanation on the laminar approach, provide specific examples of what they would like to know, such as how to use it or what values to use. This will give the instructor a better understanding of what the students need help with.
3. Include a recommendation for additional instruction on the modeling process: Several students expressed frustration with the lack of clear instructions on the assignments and the need for more guidance on the modeling process. It would be helpful to include a recommendation for the instructor to provide additional instruction on this topic in future classes.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.

 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.
 Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me",218,"I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms
Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.
I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class.
Learning about histograms
Creating histograms from the data given to me.
I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus.
I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational
Using histograms to find probabilities
I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normaldeviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.

 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that several students found the in-class assignment confusing, it would be helpful to specify which aspects of the assignment were confusing (e.g., instructions, variables, laminar approach). This will give the instructor a clearer picture of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more specific examples of student feedback: Instead of simply stating that students were confused about the laminar approach, provide specific examples of what students said or asked during class. For instance, you could mention that students were unsure about how to use Excel to create mathematical models or how to label the diagram. This will give the instructor a better understanding of the specific issues that need to be addressed.
3. Focus on the most important suggestions: The original summary is quite long and includes many suggestions. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of assignment explanations and descriptions, you could prioritize the most important suggestions and omit less relevant ones. For example, you could focus on the confusion around the in-class assignment, the laminar approach, and the specifics of the assignments, and omit the participation activity and the diagram labeling. This will help the instructor to quickly understand the key issues that need to be addressed.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the student reflections, the main sources of confusion in the lecture were the in-class assignment, the laminar approach, and the specifics of the assignments. Many students found the instructions for the in-class assignment unclear, and were unsure about how to use variables and the laminar approach to create mathematical models in Excel. Additionally, there were questions about what was due for A10 and A12. To address these issues, the instructor should provide clearer instructions for the in-class assignment, provide more examples of how to use the laminar approach, and clarify the specifics of the assignments.

Here are three specific suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Emphasize the most common sources of confusion: The summary should highlight the most common sources of confusion, such as the in-class assignment and the laminar approach, to give the instructor a clear understanding of where to focus their attention.
2. Provide more specific examples of student feedback: Instead of simply stating that students were confused, the summary should provide specific examples of what students said or asked during class.

Emphasize the main sources of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students found the in-class assignment confusing, it would be helpful to specifically highlight the areas that caused the most confusion, such as the laminar approach and creating mathematical models. This will help the instructor focus their attention on the areas that need the most improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary could benefit from more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of simply stating that students were confused about the instructions for Assignment 10, the summary could provide an example of a specific question or issue that students had. This will help the instructor better understand the nature of the confusion and provide targeted solutions.
3. Prioritize the suggestions: The suggestions should be prioritized based on the severity of the confusion and the impact it had on the students. For example, the confusion about the laminar approach and creating mathematical models should be prioritized over the confusion about the due dates for assignments, as these are critical concepts that need to be mastered.

I’m confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume","  Based on the reflections provided, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: The summary should highlight the key areas where students struggled the most, such as understanding the instructions for the in-class assignment and the pressure head question, clarity on the requirements for the A10 assignment, and difficulty with the first equation to calculate in class. This will help the instructor focus on addressing these specific areas in future classes.
2. Provide more specific examples: While the summary mentions that students needed more examples and clarification on the laminar approach, it would be helpful to provide specific examples of what types of examples or clarification would be most helpful. For instance, the instructor could provide examples of how to apply the laminar approach to specific reservoir configurations or provide more detailed explanations of the mathematical equations involved.
3. Include recommendations for future classes: The summary should include recommendations for how the instructor can address the areas of confusion in future classes. For example, the instructor could provide more detailed instructions for the in-class assignment, provide additional examples of how to apply the laminar approach, or dedicate more time to reviewing the mathematical equations involved.

Overall, the class was well-received, but some minor adjustments could be made to address the students' concerns.",Assignment 10 / A10 / A010,"I think that the class today was executed well and I'm starting to understand the class in a greater depth. 
More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates
 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren't talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don't really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
 I found nothing confusing. 
 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today's class. As we've now reached the fourth week of class, I've adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don't think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn't find anything that describes these models.

Due date for Assignment #10
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.

 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main areas of confusion: Instead of summarizing the entire lecture as ""clear and understandable,"" focus on the specific areas where students experienced confusion, such as Assignment 10 instructions, scholarly sources, Laminar Approach, and data interpretation. This will give a clearer picture of the areas that need improvement.
2. Provide more specific examples: Instead of using general terms like ""scholarly sources"" and ""reputable sources,"" provide more specific examples of the types of sources that students should use for the in-class activity and assignment. For instance, you could mention specific databases or websites that are reliable and relevant to the topic.
3. Clarify the instructions for Assignment 10: Students expressed confusion about the instructions for Assignment 10, specifically parts 4 and 5. You could clarify these instructions in the summary to avoid confusion and ensure that students understand what is expected of them. Additionally, you could provide more information on how to use the Laminar Approach and draw visual models, as students found this to be a challenging aspect of the assignment.","  REFINED SUMMARY: Based on the reflections of the students, the lecture was generally clear and understandable, with a few areas of confusion. The main points of confusion were related to the assignment instructions, specifically for Assignment 10, and the use of scholarly sources for the in-class activity. Additionally, students had difficulty understanding the Laminar Approach and how to draw visual models using it. To address these areas of confusion, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of reliable sources for the in-class activity and assignment, clarify the instructions for Assignment 10, and provide more information on how to use the Laminar Approach and draw visual models.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.

183,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the calculation of payback period and capital investment to be the most interesting aspect of today's lecture. Many students appreciated the simplicity of the formula and the ability to apply it to real-life examples. The in-class activity and breakout rooms were also found to be helpful in understanding the concept. Some students noted that the discussion on payback period and capital investment was useful in relation to the upcoming assignment. Additionally, the economic analysis and the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced were found to be interesting. Overall, the students found the topic of payback period and capital investment to be engaging and useful for their future projects.",Payback Period/Payback Time,"I found the calculation for how to find how long it will take for the company to get their investments back to be the most interesting.
Discussion with my peers 
capital investments and determining whether investment is good or bad
I actually found the capital investment formula to be very interesting in today's class.
that it was very simple to find the payback period. 
Nothing really stuck out in today's class. It was just the usual with a new formula to calculate with.
The breakout groups. Not that the large class discussion isn't interesting I just found the time for the breakout groups helped the group figure out what we have to do
Learning the specifics of how energy expenses are economically impactful was interesting. 
I doing interesting the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced. This equation will definitely help my team during the project and we are able to see and understand how the factors relate. 
I found it interesting that companies have a capital investment payback period for upgrades on their products.
 I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting. 
 What I found most interesting about today's class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses. 
 That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
 I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
 The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.
 I found the payback time interesting and working more in groups on the project
 Something I found most important in today's class was the description on how group work should be assigned and completed. Making sure everyone is on the same page and everything has clarity was something I found necessary to explain to the class. 
 I found the in class activity very interesting and it helped us to understand what we need to do for Assignment 13. Also, the breakout rooms are extremely helpful and my team and I get a good amount of work finished. 
 The different types of energy usage 
 I thought our time in breakout rooms working on the assignment was the most interesting. The time in class is greatly appreciated.
 Today's most Interesting thing was learning more about how the different types of energy are use, how much they cost and how it all works.
 I was interested in the example used for the in-class activity because it somewhat pertained to a job that I had previously worked.
 I found it really interesting that companies are able to take into consideration the amount they're saving per unit in order to determine the payback time 
 Something interesting was the in-class activity, it was fun being able to learn how to solve for a payback period because it is cool to apply it to a real life example. 
 I found learning how to calculate the payback period interesting because when looking at the assignment I was intimidated by the concept. After practicing how to do it I feel a lot more confident.
 The equation introduced for payback was very interesting and explained well
 The most interesting part of today's class was getting to work in the assignment. 
 The in class activity for the payback period was interesting. Implementing the calculations into excel make everything easier. 
 I found the group project the most interesting in today's class. I learned a great deal about how to calculate both the economic and environmental impacts of the project. Overall it was very interesting. 
 It was interesting to learn about how companies may decide whether or not to invest something and what an investment entails.
 I found it most interesting when we were learning about how to calculate payback time given capital investment and savings. 
 Today's class overall was mostly breakout rooms so there wasn't much talked about other than the equations

The students found the topic of Energy Generation to be engaging and interesting, with several reflecting on the potential of solar energy and the importance of considering energy usage and efficiency. Many students were intrigued by the concept of converting units and the various forms of energy generation, such as solar panels and heat transfer. Some students expressed enthusiasm for the new project, appreciating the real-world applications and the opportunity to explore different energy sources. The discussion of thermodynamics and the various ways power is generated and distributed was also found interesting by some students. Overall, the students seemed to enjoy the topic and are looking forward to exploring it further in the next class.",Energy Generation ,"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
All the different forms to make energy 
one thing that was interesting was that only 23 percent of energy production reaches consumers. 
The process by which companies or buildings have to think about which process to use to generate energy and the various positive and negative consequences that come from each possibility.
I liked to read the backgroung information for the next assignment 
Solar panels
I found the premise of analysing multiple affects of our task and then balancing those aspects to be enjoyable.
I like how the assignment requires our group to actually make a design decision based on our data rather than just manipulate data for the sake of manipulating data.
The new project that we were assigned today was very interesting. I'm looking forward to finishing it with my group members. 
How solar panels can be used to produce energy.
 The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project. I am interested in energy use and all of that kind of stuff, so I was interested in starting this next project.
 I found the production of energy from solar panels very interesting because the way energy can be produced for electricity is amazing to me.
 I found it interesting how only 34% of source energy was delivered to customers as electricity, meaning we still have plenty of room for improvement when it comes to increasing efficiency. 
 One thing that was interesting about today's class was how the location of a building has such a huge impact on the payback of solar energy. 
 Something I found most important in today's class was the focus on units and their overall impact on calculations and results. Making sure to outline their importance prior to giving us the project helped us understand what to expect and what is being asked of us.
 It was interesting to see how solar energy has become more and more cost effective over the years.
 It was interesting that we can do something with the solar panel which is considered as future energy
 What I found most interesting from today's class was the amount of energy conversion units. The source I used for my in class participation showed very many conversions for specific scenarios like coal or food.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

To address this, the instructor could provide more specific tasks or questions to address during the breakout rooms, and ensure that the students understand what is expected of them during these sessions.

By addressing these areas of confusion, the instructor can improve the clarity and effectiveness of the lecture, and help the students better understand the concepts of probability and z-scores."
197,"  SUMMARY:

The main topics of confusion among the students in the class were related to probability and statistics, specifically with the z-score and its relationship to standard deviation, as well as the process of finding the area under a curve using integrals. Some students also found the concept of probability in general to be confusing. Additionally, there were issues with understanding the expectations for each assignment, such as Assignment 08, and how to fill in missing data. The class found the lecture to be more reading off slides than actual teaching, and some students would have appreciated more practice with the concepts.

The students had difficulty with the following topics:

* Understanding the z-score and its relationship to standard deviation
* Finding the area under a curve using integrals
* Probability in general
* Filling in missing data in Assignment 08
* Understanding the expectations for each assignment
* The relationship between z-score and probability

The students suggested the following:

* More practice with the concepts
* More explanation on how to fill in missing data
* More detail on the relationship between z-score and standard deviation
* More examples on how to use Excel for data analysis
* Clearer instructions on each assignment and what is expected
* More time spent on probability and statistics concepts.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","  Sure, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary based on the original reflections:

1. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that the Skittles Example was a challenging topic for the students, it would be more effective to highlight the most common areas of confusion. For instance, the reflections mention that z-scores and how to calculate them were confusing, as well as adjusting the x-axis values of the histogram to percentages. The summary could focus on these specific areas and provide more detail on how to address them.
2. Provide more specific examples: The reflections mention that more examples would be helpful in understanding the concepts. The summary could provide specific examples of how to apply z-scores and how to adjust the x-axis values of the histogram to percentages. This would help students better understand the concepts and how to apply them in practice.
3. Clarify the relationship between probability and z-scores: The reflections mention that the class had difficulty understanding the relationship between probability and z-scores. The summary could clarify this relationship and explain how z-scores are used to calculate probability. This would help students understand the connection between the two concepts and how to apply them in practice.

Here's a revised summary based on the suggestions:

SUMMARY: The Skittles Example was a challenging topic for many students in today's lecture. Common areas of confusion included z-scores and how to calculate them, as well as adjusting the x-axis values of the histogram to percentages. To address these areas of confusion, more examples and clarification on the relationship between probability and z-scores would be helpful.

The students also enjoyed the in-class activity on pros and cons and found it helpful in narrowing down product weaknesses and strengths. Overall, the students found the lesson to be informative and useful for their future careers as engineers.",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
 Going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out. 
 It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
 working with my team on our project ☺️
 The application of ideas and models
 The ideas that our group came up with 
 exploring pros and cons
 What I found most interesting about today's class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians. 
 The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment.

1. Emphasize the common themes: While the reflections highlight various aspects of the lecture, there are some common themes that emerge, such as confusion about the project goals and criteria, the difference between criteria and constraints, and the need for more time spent on empathizing with users. Emphasizing these themes in the summary could help to provide a clearer picture of the main issues that students faced.
2. Provide more specific examples: While the reflections mention specific aspects of the lecture that were confusing, the summary could benefit from more specific examples to illustrate these points. For example, instead of simply stating that the difference between criteria and constraints was confusing, the summary could provide an example of how the distinction was unclear or how it impacted the students' understanding of the project.
3. Focus on the project-related issues: While some reflections mention non-project-related issues, such as the amount of work to be completed in a short amount of time, the summary should focus on the project-related issues that were discussed in the lecture. This could help to provide a clearer picture of the specific challenges that students faced in relation to the project, and how they can be addressed.

 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",411,"The executive summary part of A16
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment
The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
In the beginning, we weren’t sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!","  Based on the reflections of the students, here are three suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: The summary should highlight the key areas where students experienced confusion, such as Assignment 16, project goals and timeline, stakeholders and users, data collection, and problem scoping. This will help the instructor focus on the areas that need more attention.
2. Provide more specific examples: The summary should provide more specific examples of the confusion that students experienced. For instance, instead of just stating that students were confused about the difference between criteria and constraints, the summary could provide an example of a specific situation where students struggled with this concept.
3. Offer concrete recommendations: The summary should offer concrete recommendations for how the instructor can address the confusion that students experienced. For example, the summary could suggest providing more examples or explanations of the concepts that students found confusing, or offering additional support or resources to help students understand the material.

Here is a revised version of the summary that incorporates these suggestions:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: The majority of students found the lecture to be understandable and easy to follow, with no major confusion. However, some students experienced confusion in specific areas, such as Assignment 16, project goals and timeline, stakeholders and users, data collection, and problem scoping.
2. Provide more specific examples: Students were confused about the difference between criteria and constraints, and how to identify and empathize with different users. For example, one student was unsure about how to gather data for the survey of the public.
3. Offer concrete recommendations: To address the confusion, the instructor could provide more examples or explanations of the concepts that students found confusing, or offer additional support or resources to help students understand the material. For instance, the instructor could provide more information about how to identify and empathize with different users, or offer a review session to help students understand the material better.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

219,"  SUMMARY:

The majority of the students found the topic of prototyping and testing to be confusing, particularly when it comes to creating physical prototypes and testing them virtually. Many teams are unsure about how to proceed with prototyping their ideas, especially those that require physical materials or testing on a large scale. Some students expressed confusion about the specifications of Assignment 18 and how to implement questions for concrete details. However, the class found the discussion on the importance of prototyping to be informative and easy to follow.

Key points of confusion include:

* How to create physical prototypes and test them virtually
* How to test ideas on a large scale with limited materials
* Clarification on the specifications of Assignment 18
* Implementing questions for concrete details

Overall, the students would benefit from more information on how to create and test prototypes, as well as clarification on the assignment specifications.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

The students found the topic of problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers to be the most interesting aspects of the lecture. They appreciated the clarification on who a stakeholder can be and the importance of research before starting any design ideas. The project assignment and the opportunity to work in teams to create a solution for campus safety was also well received. Many students found the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between a novice and professional engineer to be useful and informative. Additionally, the project objective was seen as arguably better than previous classes. Overall, the students are excited to work on the new project and incorporate their knowledge from previous assignments to complete it.",Problem Scoping,"starting our own design project 
I found the client stakeholder relations to be very interesting as well as the differences between a anovice and professional engineer.
Differences between client and end user
I liked working on problem scoping and developing ways to measure constraints and criteria
The project that was assigned to us for the final design was very interesting especially when we went into breakout rooms and discussed it
The issue of improving campus safety sounds interesting.
Learning about problem scoping and the upcoming design project
That we are creating our own ideas to a problem we are given.
I found working on the in class assignment to be most interesting. 
The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project to work on with my team
 The most interesting part of today's class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project. 
 I did not realize that we had been slowly incorporating different aspects of design into our assignments 
 Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project 
 starting a new project was the most interesting today
 It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
 The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem. 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. 
 I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
 I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers. 
 Design issues as a whole
 I found the research during problem scoping interesting.

1. Emphasize the importance of problem scoping: The summary could highlight the significance of problem scoping in the design process and how it helps engineers to define a project and identify the key stakeholders. This could be done by adding a sentence that emphasizes the importance of problem scoping and how it sets the foundation for the design process.
2. Focus on the students' interest in the project assignment: The summary could focus more on the students' excitement about the project assignment and the opportunity to work in teams to create a solution for campus safety. This could be done by adding more details about the project assignment and how it relates to the students' interests and goals.
3. Use more specific language: The summary could benefit from using more specific language to describe the students' reflections. For example, instead of using ""interesting,"" ""useful,"" and ""informative,"" the summary could use more specific adjectives such as ""insightful,"" ""practical,"" and ""revealing."" This would make the summary more engaging and help to convey the students' reflections more effectively.

Here's an example of how the summary could be revised based on these suggestions:

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of problem scoping:

The students found the topic of problem scoping to be particularly insightful, as it highlighted the importance of defining a project and identifying key stakeholders before beginning the design process.

However, the students generally found the tail vs non-tail recursion and the mechanics of traversals in code to be clear. To improve understanding, additional examples and explanations on non-tail recursive functions, preorder and inorder traversal, and tail recursion would be helpful.

Here are some specific improvements that could be made to the summary:

1. Emphasize the confusion around non-tail recursive functions: The summary should highlight the difficulty students faced in understanding non-tail recursive functions and provide more clarity on this topic. For example, ""Many students struggled with the concept of non-tail recursive functions and their implementation, and would benefit from additional examples or explanations on this topic.""
2. Clarify the difference between preorder and inorder traversal: The summary should explain the confusion around the different traversal methods and provide more context on the benefits of each approach. For instance, ""Some students found it challenging to differentiate between preorder and inorder traversal, and would benefit from seeing more examples of how each method is used in practice.""
3. Provide more examples of tail recursion: The summary should include more examples of tail recursion to help students better understand this concept. For example, ""Some students were unclear on the concept of tail recursion and would benefit from seeing more examples of how it can be implemented in practice, such as recursive function calls that can be optimized as a loop.""

1. Emphasize the mixed understanding of the lecture material: Instead of saying ""students had mixed understanding,"" you could say ""students experienced a range of understanding, with some finding everything clear while others struggled with specific concepts."" This phrasing emphasizes the complexity of the students' understanding and highlights the need for further clarification.
2. Focus on the most common areas of confusion: While it's important to acknowledge that students had mixed understanding, it's more helpful to focus on the most common areas of confusion. For example, you could say ""some students struggled with finding vmax and understanding the use of references for Milestone 1."" This focuses the summary on the most critical areas that need improvement.
3. Use specific language to describe the confusion: Instead of using general phrases like ""confusing"" or ""challenging,"" try to use more specific language to describe the confusion. For example, you could say ""students were confused about how to calculate vmax"" or ""students had difficulty understanding the reference material for Milestone 1.""

Providing more detail on the right hand rule and how to apply it in different situations could help clarify the concept and reduce confusion.","  REFINED SUMMARY:

Based on the student reflections, the main areas of confusion related to integration were:

1. Integration to find the magnetic field: Many students struggled with integrating to find the magnetic field, particularly with respect to the circular wire problem.
2. Right hand rule: Students were confused about how to use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field and force.
3. Direction of magnetic fields: Students had difficulty identifying the direction of magnetic fields when placed together.

To address these areas of confusion, it would be helpful to provide more detail on the right hand rule and how to apply it in different situations. Additionally, providing specific examples to illustrate the confusion, such as the circular wire problem, can help clarify the concepts and reduce confusion. Emphasizing the common themes of confusion, such as integration and the right hand rule, can also help to make the summary more concise and focused on the key issues."

To address these issues, the instructor may want to provide more examples and visual aids to help students better understand the concepts and how to apply them to real-world scenarios."
309,"  SUMMARY:

Students had difficulty understanding the concepts related to current in the lecture, particularly with regards to Lenz's Law, inductors, and the difference between Uc and Ul. They found it challenging to apply the equations for finding current in RL circuits and were confused about the function that defines current. Additionally, students had trouble understanding how inductors and resistors differ in their behavior in circuits and how to determine the amount of current from a voltage graph. The concept of current switching on and off over time and its effect on potential energy in capacitors/inductors was also confusing for some students. Finally, students had difficulty distinguishing between using the current switched on and off equations in their applications.",Related to Current,"I am still confused about finding the direction through lenz law.

1. Emphasize the main sources of confusion: The summary should highlight the key areas where students struggled the most, such as understanding Lenz's Law, differentiating between Uc and Ul, and applying equations for finding current in RL circuits. By focusing on these areas, the instructor can target their future lectures and examples to address these specific challenges.
2. Use clearer language: Some of the student reflections mention confusion about specific concepts, but the language used is vague. For example, ""the second top hat question with the Henry"" could be rephrased as ""the question about the Henry's law and the current flowing through an inductor."" Using clearer language can help to reduce confusion and make the summary more accurate.
3. Provide more specific examples: While the summary mentions that students had trouble applying the equations for finding current in RL circuits, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of what types of questions or situations caused confusion. For instance, the summary could mention that students were confused about how to determine the current in a circuit with multiple inductors or how to apply the equations when the switch is on for a long time. By providing more specific examples, the instructor can better understand where students are struggling and tailor their future lectures accordingly.","  REFINED SUMMARY:
