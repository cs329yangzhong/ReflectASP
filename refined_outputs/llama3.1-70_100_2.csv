Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""including calculating the moment for non-uniform fields"" as it slightly deviates from the focused topic of Electric/Uniform Field. Instead, focus on the students' confusion with dipoles in a uniform electric field.

2. To improve the summary's focus, rephrase the sentence ""Additionally, some students found the relationship between electric fields and forces to be unclear, including identifying the directions of electric fields and forces"" to specifically mention how this relates to uniform fields. For example, ""Some students struggled to understand how electric forces relate to uniform electric fields.""

3. To make the summary more coherent, consider combining the last two sentences into one, as they both discuss students' confusion with electric fields. For example, ""The top hat questions on electric fields, particularly those involving uniform fields and dipoles, were a source of confusion for many students.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concepts related to electric and uniform fields to be confusing, particularly when it comes to dipoles in a uniform electric field. Several students struggled to understand how dipoles work in a uniform electric field and determining the potential energy of a dipole. Some students struggled to understand how electric forces relate to uniform electric fields. The top hat questions on electric fields, particularly those involving uniform fields and dipoles, were a source of confusion for many students."

I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.

projectile motion and falling monkey","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""citing its unique and real-world application of projectile motion"" as it's already implied that the students found the Monkey Problem interesting and it's a real-world application. This would help to streamline the summary and focus on the key points.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""The problem's ability to illustrate the concept of relative motion and the independence of x and y components in projectile motion was also widely noted"" to focus more specifically on the Monkey Problem. For example, ""Students were also struck by how the Monkey Problem demonstrated the independence of horizontal and vertical motions, leading to the counterintuitive result that aiming directly at the monkey would result in a hit.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider removing the phrase ""Many students appreciated the video demonstration of the problem, which helped them visualize the concept"" and instead, integrate the idea into the sentence about the students' fascination with the problem. For example, ""Students were fascinated by the idea that aiming directly at the monkey would result in a hit, regardless of the monkey's fall, as illustrated by the video demonstration.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the Monkey Problem to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture.

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.

Many students appreciated the step-by-step approach to solving vector addition problems, finding it easy to follow and understand. The use of unit vectors to add components of a vector was also highlighted as a helpful concept. Additionally, students enjoyed working on vector addition problems in breakout rooms, finding it beneficial to collaborate and discuss ideas with peers.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easysystem of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I reallylike when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors toeasily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of students appreciating the step-by-step approach and the use of unit vectors into a single sentence, such as: ""Students found the step-by-step approach to solving vector addition problems, including the use of unit vectors to add components, to be easy to follow and understand.""

2. To focus more on the topic of Vector Addition, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when explained through the principle of moving backwards along one arrow"" as it is not a direct reflection on vector addition, but rather a specific teaching method. Instead, focus on the students' understanding and appreciation of vector addition concepts.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about what students found interesting or helpful about vector addition, such as the fact that they can add vectors by combining their components, or that they can use trigonometry to add vectors and find angle measures. This would provide a clearer picture of what aspects of vector addition resonated with the students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of vector addition to be interesting and easy to understand, particularly when explained through a step-by-step approach that includes using unit vectors to add components.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem.

 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of students' interest in the relationship between normal force and friction, and the molecular level explanation of friction, including cold welds, into one sentence. This would eliminate the need for two separate sentences and make the summary more streamlined.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Static Friction, consider removing the phrase ""applying the coefficients of friction to various problems"" and instead focus on specific examples that are directly related to static friction, such as the sandpaper block or the concept of cold welds.

3. To improve clarity, consider rephrasing the sentence ""The idea that surface area does not affect the force of friction was also a surprising and interesting point for many students"" to ""Students were surprised to learn that surface area does not contribute to the force of static friction."" This rephrased sentence is more direct and concise, and it explicitly states that the concept is related to static friction.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of static friction particularly interesting, with many noting its relationship to normal force and the molecular-level explanation, including the concept of cold welds.

 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in the context of relative motion and circular motion"" as it adds extra information that is not crucial to the main point. This will help to focus the summary on the key issues related to the Quadratic/Kinematic Equation.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""The dinosaur problem, which involved relative motion and acceleration, was a particular point of difficulty for several students"" to ""Students struggled with applying kinematic equations to problems involving relative motion, as seen in the dinosaur example."" This rephrased sentence directly ties the difficulty to the application of kinematic equations.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining the last two sentences into one, such as: ""Some students also found the use of quadratic equations and the concept of direction and sign in kinematic equations to be confusing."" This will help to eliminate redundant information and make the summary more streamlined.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the application of kinematic equations to be a challenging aspect of the lecture, with many expressing confusion about determining which equation to use in a given situation.

The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well

 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.

Overall, students would benefit from additional practice and explanation on relative motion, particularly in two dimensions, and clarification on how to apply vector addition and subtraction in different reference frames.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long.

the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining.

 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption.

I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors.

 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of ""when to use sine or cosine"" and ""applying angles in different quadrants"" into a single point, as they are closely related. This would help to eliminate redundancy and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Angles, consider removing the sentence about the relationship between the direction of a resultant vector and its value, as this is more related to vectors in general rather than angles specifically. This would help to keep the summary more on-topic.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific issues students had with angles, such as the confusion about adding or subtracting 180 degrees, or the difficulty with understanding angles in the context of inverse tangent. This would help to provide a clearer picture of the specific challenges students faced with the topic of Angles.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of angles in vector math to be a source of confusion, particularly when it comes to determining when to use sine or cosine and applying angles in different quadrants. Specifically, students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract 180 degrees to an angle, especially in the context of inverse tangent, and how to identify when to do so. Additionally, some students mentioned difficulty with understanding how to determine the direction of a vector based on its angle, and how to visualize and draw vectors in different cases."

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider focusing on the specific aspects of the last question that caused confusion, such as combining free body diagrams, determining forces, and calculating acceleration, rather than stating that the setup was confusing.

2. To improve the focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""due to time constraints"" as it introduces an external factor (time) that is not directly related to the students' understanding of the last question.

3. To make the summary more representative of the students' reflections, consider adding that some students specifically struggled with the concept of friction between the two blocks, as mentioned in several reflections, to provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: The last question of the lecture, involving two blocks with friction between them, was a common source of confusion among students. Many struggled to combine the free body diagrams, determine the forces, and calculate the acceleration, particularly in understanding the role of friction between the blocks.

 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension

 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity”

 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.

 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun.

 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with some exceptions"" as it is not specific and does not add much value to the summary. Instead, focus on the specific areas of confusion mentioned by the students.

2. To improve the focus on the topic Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation, consider rephrasing the summary to directly address the calculations involved. For example, instead of stating ""The environmental impact section of Assignment 13 was also a point of confusion for some"", rephrase it to ""Some students struggled with the environmental impact calculations in Assignment 13, specifically with determining CO2 emissions and finding the required data"".

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture on environmental impact and impact calculation to be clear"" as it does not provide specific information about the topic. Instead, start the summary directly with the areas of confusion mentioned by the students, such as ""Calculating CO2 emissions, particularly for coal, was a point of confusion for some students due to multiple conversions required.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Calculating CO2 emissions, particularly for coal, was a point of confusion for some students due to multiple conversions required.

 I'm still confused on the environmental portion of A13. 
 I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low 
 I thought the class was straightforward and there was nothing really confusing about it
 My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
 Today's class was good. 
 The A13 environmental impact was somewhat confusing.
 the differences in grams of CO2 per gallon of gas
 The in class activity had wrong numbers.
 At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2. 
 Nothing i'm doing pretty well
 The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
 nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
 Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
 The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing 
 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing
 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation. 
 I am not sure what the carbon footprint ya dot do with anything",130,"The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.

131,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with many expressing that they understood the class dynamics and expectations. However, some areas of confusion arose regarding homework and project directions. Specifically, students sought more information on the BikeShare project, including its objectives and requirements. Additionally, several students expressed difficulty navigating Brightspace and understanding the due dates for assignments, with some suggesting a consolidated calendar would be helpful. A few students also requested more details on upcoming assignments, such as CATME tasks and the BikeShare project timeline, to better prepare for the semester.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with navigating Brightspace and understanding due dates, into a single sentence. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more streamlined.

2. To improve focus on the topic of HW and Project Directions/Instruction, consider removing the sentence that mentions students' understanding of class dynamics and expectations, as this is not directly related to the topic.

3. To provide more specificity, consider adding more details about the types of information students were seeking regarding the BikeShare project and upcoming assignments. For example, you could mention that students wanted to know more about the project's objectives, requirements, and timeline, as well as the specific tasks and due dates for CATME assignments. This would help to provide a clearer picture of the areas where students were seeking more information.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear, but some areas of confusion arose regarding homework and project directions.

A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.","Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider specifying that the confusion about feedback was mainly related to Assignment 17 and the iteration section, as this was a common theme among students. This would make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of feedback.

2. Emphasize that the main issue with feedback was the lack of clarity on where the feedback was coming from and how to incorporate it, rather than the concept of feedback itself. This would provide a clearer understanding of the students' concerns.

3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students were unclear about the expectations for the assignment, particularly since the feedback for a previous assignment had not been received yet"" to ""Some students were unsure how to proceed with Assignment 17 as they had not received feedback on their previous work (A16)"". This would make the connection between the two assignments clearer and more concise.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion about the feedback aspect of Assignment 17, particularly in the iteration section, due to unclear expectations on where the feedback was coming from and how to incorporate it. A significant issue was the lack of feedback on their previous work (A16), which made it challenging for students to proceed with Assignment 17. The iteration section was also a point of confusion, with students unsure of how to proceed without receiving feedback on their previous work."

1.

2. The summary could be more concise by focusing on the most common points of confusion mentioned by the students, such as the iteration process and the feedback expectations, rather than trying to include every single point of confusion mentioned.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Deliverables/Instructions Unclear, it would be helpful to remove the mention of the feedback process and instead focus solely on the unclear instructions and deliverables for A17, such as the conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document, and the unclear expectations for specific sections like Part 5.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found specific aspects of Assignment 17 (A17) to be unclear, including the number of ideas required, the submission expectations, and the iteration process.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of students enjoying the video presentation aspect and the 3D models into one sentence, as these are closely related concepts. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

This would help to keep the summary centered on the main topic.

3. To make the summary more representative of the students' reflections, consider adding a phrase to acknowledge that many students found the project presentation to be the most interesting part of the class, despite some students finding the class to be uneventful or basic.

To improve the focus on the topic of Car CO2 Emissions, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students also found it eye-opening to learn about the impact of their individual actions on the environment"" to specifically mention car emissions. For example, ""Students were struck by the significant impact their car's emissions have on the environment.""

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""and exploring the environmental impact of their daily choices"" as it is somewhat broad and not directly related to car CO2 emissions. Instead, focus on the specific activity of calculating car emissions and the students' reactions to it.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the activity of calculating their car's carbon footprint to be particularly interesting, with students surprised by the large amount of CO2 emissions their vehicles produced, even those with ""good gas mileage.""

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point.

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the multiple mentions of confusion with the laminar approach, into a single sentence. For example, ""Many students struggled to understand the laminar approach, including its application to different shapes and calculation of the reservoir's volume.""

2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the mention of general concepts like ""r and r^2 values"" and instead focus on how these concepts relate specifically to Assignments 10 and 11. For example, ""Some students were confused about the use of r and r^2 values in the context of Assignment 10's regression lines and mathematical models.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific parts of Assignments 10 and 11 that caused confusion, such as Part 5 of Assignment 10 or the calculation of the regression constant value in Assignment 11. This will help to provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Assignments 10 and 11 to be the most confusing aspects of the lecture, particularly with regards to the laminar approach and its application to different shapes and calculation of the reservoir's volume. Many students struggled to understand the instructions for Assignment 10, specifically Part 5, and had difficulty with the regression lines and mathematical models. Some students were also confused about the use of r and r^2 values in the context of Assignment 10's regression lines and mathematical models, as well as the difference between SST and SSE. Additionally, students had trouble with specific parts of the assignments, such as calculating the regression constant value in Assignment 11 and understanding the requirements for Assignment 10's mathematical models."

 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.
 Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me",218,"I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms
Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.
I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when applied to real-world examples such as the skittles project"" and instead, directly state that the skittles project was an interesting application of histograms. This will help to streamline the summary and focus on the key points.

2. To improve the focus on histograms, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students appreciated the visual aspect of histograms, noting that they can be very informational and effectively display data"" to ""Students found histograms to be a useful tool for visualizing and understanding data"". This will help to emphasize the importance of histograms in data analysis.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the last two sentences into one, such as ""Students also found it interesting to learn about the relationship between histograms and z-scores, and how they can be used together to analyze data and calculate probabilities"". This will help to eliminate redundant information and make the summary more efficient.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the topic of histograms to be interesting, with the skittles project being a notable application.

Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.

I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views. 
 I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.

 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.

 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.

176,"SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on engineering failures to be insightful and interesting, particularly the case of the Taum Sauk reservoir, which highlighted the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in engineering projects. Many students appreciated the real-world examples and the opportunity to analyze the causes of various engineering disasters, such as the Taum Sauk reservoir's design flaws, negligence, and cost-cutting measures. They noted that even small oversights or miscalculations can lead to catastrophic failures, emphasizing the need for diligence and accountability in engineering.",Engineering Failures,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
 I found A12 to be most interesting today because I started to understand what some of the calculations were asking. I also found the engineering failures to be interesting. 
 Working on the in class activity was interesting because I got to research the TAUM Sauk failure. 
 How oversights in the engineering of structures can lead to massive failures
 I liked that I was able to spend more time with my group mates so that i could work on A12.
 I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an interesting part of today's class. It was interesting because we got to see decision failures. 
 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.

179,"SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 10 and the In-Class Activity 10 to be confusing, particularly with regards to the instructions and expectations. Several students mentioned difficulties understanding the ""laminar approach"" and mathematical models required for the assignment. Some students also struggled with determining what sources were acceptable and how to cite them properly. Additionally, there was confusion about the scope of the assignment, with some students unsure about what was expected for each part, especially parts 4 and 5. A few students also mentioned that they needed more time to complete the in-class activity and that the instructions were not clear.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with understanding the ""laminar approach"" and mathematical models, into a single point. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more streamlined.

2. To improve focus on the topic, consider removing the point about needing more time to complete the in-class activity, as this is more related to the logistics of the class rather than the content of Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific areas of confusion, such as what aspects of the ""laminar approach"" or mathematical models were unclear, or what specific instructions were unclear about the scope of the assignment. This would help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' difficulties and allow for more targeted support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 10 and In-Class Activity 10 to be confusing, particularly with regards to the instructions and expectations. The main areas of confusion included understanding the ""laminar approach"" and mathematical models required for the assignment, with specific difficulties in applying these concepts to parts 4 and 5.

 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about the technical brief, mathematical modeling, and the laminar approach, into a single point about the overall clarity of the assignment instructions.
2. To focus more on the topic of Due Dates or Deliverables, consider removing or rephrasing points that are more related to the content of the assignment, such as the confusion about the laminar approach, and instead focus on the specific issues related to due dates and deliverables, such as the discrepancies in due dates and the unclear scope of the assignment.
3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific due dates or deliverables that were unclear, such as the due date listed on Brightspace not matching the instructor's announcement, and the confusion about what was due for Assignment 10 and when.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the instructions and expectations for Assignment 10 to be unclear, leading to confusion about the deliverables and due dates. Specifically, there were discrepancies in due dates, with some students noting that the due date listed on Brightspace did not match the instructor's announcement. Additionally, students were unsure about the scope of the assignment, with some believing they were only working on part of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. Overall, students struggled to understand what was due and when, highlighting the need for clearer instructions and communication about assignment deliverables and deadlines."

The real-world applications of energy generation, such as analyzing energy usage for a municipal building, also sparked their interest. Additionally, students enjoyed exploring the benefits and drawbacks of different energy sources, including solar energy, and were excited to work on a project that involves designing and calculating the energy generated from solar panels.",Energy Generation ,"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
All the different forms to make energy 
one thing that was interesting was that only 23 percent of energy production reaches consumers. 
The process by which companies or buildings have to think about which process to use to generate energy and the various positive and negative consequences that come from each possibility.
I liked to read the backgroung information for the next assignment 
Solar panels
I found the premise of analysing multiple affects of our task and then balancing those aspects to be enjoyable.
I like how the assignment requires our group to actually make a design decision based on our data rather than just manipulate data for the sake of manipulating data.

To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in the context of energy production and consumption"" as it is already implied in the topic of calculations/unit conversions and the context of the reflections. This will help to focus the summary on the key points related to calculations and unit conversions.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students also enjoyed exploring online tools and resources, such as those provided by the US Department of Energy, to aid in energy conversions"" to focus more on the calculations and unit conversions aspect, rather than the online tools. For example, ""Students appreciated the availability of online resources to facilitate energy conversions and calculations.""

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""as it introduced a new concept that can be applied to real-world problems"" and instead focus on the students' reactions to the discussion on design trade-offs. This would help to streamline the summary and eliminate unnecessary words.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Trade-Offs, consider removing the sentence ""The concept of trade-offs was particularly relevant in the context of environmental impact and carbon footprints, which was also a major focus of the lecture."" While this sentence provides context, it shifts the focus away from trade-offs and onto environmental impact and carbon footprints. Instead, the summary could focus on how students found the discussion on trade-offs interesting and relevant to their future work as engineers.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding a quote or a specific example from the student reflections to illustrate their interest in trade-offs. For example, the summary could mention that students found the idea of trade-offs ""very interesting because it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future."" This would help to add depth and specificity to the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on design trade-offs to be a highlight of the lecture, with many noting it as ""very interesting"" and a valuable tool for future problem-solving. One student aptly captured the significance of trade-offs, stating that it's ""something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future."" The discussion on trade-offs resonated with students, who appreciated the examples and importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions as engineers."

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class

 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes).

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz.

 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.

1. To improve the summary's focus on Project Logistics, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture on project logistics to be clear"" as it's not directly related to the topic. Instead, start with the specific areas of confusion to make the summary more concise.

2. Emphasize the project timeline and milestones as a major point of confusion, as multiple students mentioned concerns about the workload and time constraints. This could be rephrased to ""Students were unclear about the project timeline, milestones, and workload expectations, with some finding the scope of work overwhelming.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider breaking down the confusion regarding assignments into specific examples, such as ""Some students were uncertain about the requirements for Assignment 16, including which sections were due and the submission process."" This would provide a clearer picture of the logistical challenges students faced.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding project logistics, particularly in determining criteria and constraints for the problem statement, understanding the difference between criteria and constraints, and identifying stakeholders and their roles.

 I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
 It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use 
 Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
 How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.
 Nothing.
 no confusion
 I was confused as to what we should do with the linear regression line in number 6. 
 Nothing we just did the taum sauk assignment
 Nothing was confusing today
 I wasn't sure exactly where to start on the assignment 12. My group was very confused when we went to studio time, and we didn't have a pt or gta come into our breakout session to help us out.
 I found nothing too confusing in today's class. The only slightly confusing thing was doing conversions for assignment A12.
 Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel. 
 What we needed to do in part 6.a and 6.b
 How to calculate the power generator 
 Nothing much! I felt like everything was explained clearly and I understood what my tasks are for Assignment 12.
 Not much was explained in today's class ",330,"The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn’t that confusing
We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.

Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel.","Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention the specific aspects of flow rate calculations that caused confusion, such as determining time intervals and finding instantaneous flow rate, rather than just stating that calculations could have been explained more thoroughly.

2. The mention of alternative mathematical models for modeling height and volume could be removed from the summary as it seems to be a tangential point and not directly related to the topic of flow rate. This would help to maintain a sharper focus on the topic.

3. The summary could be rephrased to better distinguish between the students' understanding of the flow rate concept itself and their confusion with the application of the concept to Assignment 12. This would provide a clearer picture of the students' grasp of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of flow rate to be clear, but some expressed confusion about specific aspects of calculating flow rate, such as determining time intervals and finding instantaneous flow rate, particularly when using Excel. Some students were unsure about how to apply these concepts to Assignment 12, specifically in parts 6 and 7. While the majority of students did not report significant confusion with the flow rate concept itself, they did suggest that more detailed explanations and examples of flow rate calculations would be helpful to solidify their understanding and application of the concept."

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding

One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.

1. To improve the summary's focus on the in-class activity, consider removing the phrase ""particularly with regards to its relevance to the environmental analysis"" and instead focus on the specific aspects of the activity that caused confusion, such as the density of gasoline and carbon footprint calculation.

2. To make the summary more concise, combine similar points, such as the students' struggles with calculations and the uncertainty about the purpose of including certain information, into a single sentence. For example, ""Some students struggled with the calculations, including the carbon footprint calculation, and were unsure about the purpose of including certain values, such as the density of gasoline and concentration of gas.""

3. To better capture the range of student experiences, consider adding a sentence to the summary that highlights the fact that many students were able to clarify their understanding through group discussion and the instructor's examples, while also acknowledging that some students remained confused. This could help to provide a more nuanced view of the students' experiences with the in-class activity.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the in-class activity to be somewhat confusing, specifically with regards to the inclusion of certain values such as the density of gasoline and the carbon footprint calculation.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""as it allowed them to work collaboratively with their peers and see their ideas take shape"" and instead focus on the key points of brainstorming and idea generation. This could result in a revised sentence such as: ""Many students found the brainstorming and idea generation aspect of the class to be the most interesting, with some noting that the breakout rooms and group discussions were particularly helpful.""

2. To focus more on the topic of Brainstorming/ideas, consider removing the sentence ""Students also appreciated the creative freedom and potential for innovation that came with brainstorming, and many were excited to move forward with their ideas and turn them into prototypes."" While this sentence is related to brainstorming, it also mentions prototyping, which is a separate topic. By removing this sentence, the summary can stay more focused on brainstorming and idea generation.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about what students enjoyed about the brainstorming process. For example, the original reflections mention that students enjoyed ""narrowing down their six ideas to the top three"" and ""coming up with different solutions."" Incorporating these specific details into the summary could make it more engaging and informative.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the brainstorming and idea generation aspect of the class to be the most interesting, with some noting that the breakout rooms and group discussions were particularly helpful.

This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.
 everything was pretty clear
 I didn't find anything that was too confusing in today's class.
 The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic Assignment 17, consider removing the phrase ""the type of solution necessary for the assignment"" as it is not directly related to the confusion about the assignment itself, but rather a general aspect of the assignment.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic Assignment 17, consider rephrasing the summary to group similar points together, for example: ""Many students found Assignment 17 to be somewhat confusing, with several expressing uncertainty about the specific sections required and the extent of the work needed. Some students also mentioned that the instructions for the assignment were not completely clear, and had questions about specific parts such as the functional decomposition and iteration sections.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 17 to be somewhat confusing, with several expressing uncertainty about the specific sections required and the extent of the work needed.

233,"SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class activity on pros and cons to be somewhat confusing, particularly due to a lack of familiarity with the products being compared, such as French presses. Some students struggled to understand the depth and detail required for the pros and cons analysis, while others found the activity to be unclear due to limited access to information about the products. Additionally, a few students expressed confusion about the parameters of the activity, such as whether to consider specific variants of the products.",Pros and cons/in class activity,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first.

 Design issues as a whole
 I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
 I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.

 I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
 I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
 The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the points about inductors and current into a single sentence, such as: ""Many students struggled to understand the behavior of inductors in circuits, including how they interact with current, other components, and the application of equations for finding current in RL circuits.""

2. To focus more on the topic of current, consider removing or rephrasing the sentence about Lenz's Law, as it is more related to magnetic fields than current. Instead, emphasize the students' confusion about the direction of current in RL circuits.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific aspects of current that students found confusing, such as the effect of switching current on and off over time, or the relationship between current and inductance in graphs of voltage vs time.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students struggled to understand the behavior of inductors in circuits, including how they interact with current, other components, and the application of equations for finding current in RL circuits. Specifically, they found it challenging to determine the direction of current in RL circuits and understand how switching current on and off over time affects potential energy in capacitors and inductors.
