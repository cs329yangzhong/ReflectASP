Instead, specify the concepts that caused confusion, such as ""the application of the equation 0.5CV^2 to different shapes"" or ""the role of dielectrics in weakening the electric field.""

3. To improve clarity, consider rephrasing sentences to directly state the specific concept that caused confusion, rather than using phrases like ""the distinction between variables U and V was unclear."" For example, ""Students were unsure about the difference between U (energy) and V (electric potential) and how they relate to capacitance.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with calculations involving capacitance, including those for multiple charges, cylindrical capacitors, and the relationship between energy and capacitance.

 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well. 
 I think the tophat questions overall were the most difficult part about class. ",36,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don’t think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force.
In today’s class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate.

I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.

Many were fascinated by the idea that aiming directly at the monkey would result in a hit, regardless of its falling motion, due to the independence of horizontal and vertical velocities. The problem's uniqueness and the use of a relatable scenario made it memorable and enjoyable for students to learn about.",Monkey Problem,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey

1. To improve the summary, consider adding specific quotes or phrases from the students' reflections to provide more depth and authenticity to the summary. For example, including phrases like ""it still kinda blows my mind"" or ""I found it interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time"" can help illustrate the students' fascination with the Monkey Problem.

2. Emphasize the key concept that students found most interesting about the Monkey Problem, which is the independence of horizontal and vertical velocities. This concept was mentioned in several reflections, and highlighting it in the summary can help to focus the discussion on the core idea.

3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the Monkey Problem. For example, instead of stating that the problem was a ""standout topic,"" the summary could directly state that ""students were fascinated by the Monkey Problem"" and then elaborate on why. This can help to eliminate unnecessary words and make the summary more direct.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were fascinated by the Monkey Problem, with many finding it ""mind-blowing"" and ""interesting"" due to its unique scenario and real-world application.

51,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of vector addition to be interesting, particularly when explained through the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and the use of unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.

The use of visual aids, like drawings and triangles, also helped students understand and visualize vector addition.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.

I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly those involving tension forces"" and instead, directly state that tension forces were a major area of difficulty, as it is already mentioned later in the summary. This will help to avoid repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the focus on the topic of Conceptual Problems, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students found the explanations and examples provided in class to be helpful, but still required more practice and clarification to fully grasp the concepts"" to focus more on the conceptual difficulties rather than the helpfulness of the explanations. For example, ""Students struggled to apply Newton's laws to complex problems and required more practice to fully understand the concepts.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining the last two sentences into one, as they both discuss areas of confusion related to inertial reference frames and relative motion. For example, ""Inertial reference frames and relative motion were also areas of difficulty, with students struggling to visualize and understand the interactions between objects in different frames of reference.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found conceptual problems challenging, with tension forces being a major area of difficulty.

 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me.

 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly

I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the Monkey Problem was a challenging topic for many students, and additional explanation or practice problems may be necessary to solidify their understanding."" This sentence is not directly related to the reflections and seems to be an inference. Instead, focus on summarizing the specific points mentioned by the students.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

Specific areas of confusion included vector subtraction, such as in the ""Yeti problem"" and TopHat questions, where students were unclear on whether to add or subtract vectors in different scenarios. Additionally, unit vectors and their purpose were unclear to some students, and a few had difficulties visualizing vectors and applying vector math to word problems, particularly in determining the direction of resultant vectors and using negative vectors."
87,"SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the use of angles in vector math, specifically when to use sine versus cosine, and how to determine the direction of a resultant vector. Some students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract 180 degrees to an angle, particularly when dealing with inverse tangent.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.

I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
 I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.",97,"I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging.

For example, instead of mentioning ""conceptual questions"" and ""relatable examples"" separately, combine them into a single phrase, such as ""conceptual questions with relatable examples like the spaceship and salami.""
2. To focus more on the topic of Top Hat Questions, remove the mention of Newton's Laws and tension, as these are broader topics that are not exclusively related to Top Hat Questions. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of Top Hat Questions that students found engaging, such as the use of real-world examples and the challenge of problem-solving.
3. To make the summary more specific and detailed, consider including more specific quotes or examples from the student reflections. For example, instead of saying ""students enjoyed the conceptual questions,"" say ""students enjoyed questions like the one about jumping on a scale, which helped them visualize real-world applications of the concepts.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Top Hat questions engaging and helpful in solidifying their understanding of concepts, particularly through conceptual questions with relatable examples like the spaceship, salami, and tug of war scenario.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly the concept of tension"" and instead, integrate it into the list of examples that students found interesting. This would make the summary more focused on the topic of Newton's Laws as a whole.

2. To improve the focus on Newton's Laws, the summary could explicitly mention how the examples and practice problems helped students understand the laws, rather than just stating that they ""solidified their understanding of forces and Newton's Laws."" For instance, it could mention how the examples illustrated the relationship between force and mass, or how the reference frames helped students understand the concept of inertial and non-inertial reference frames.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Newton's Laws, consider removing the mention of ""group work"" and ""top hat questions"" as these are more related to the teaching methods rather than the topic itself. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of Newton's Laws that students found interesting, such as the relationship between force and mass, or the concept of tension.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture, particularly enjoying examples and practice problems that illustrated key concepts, such as tension in the tug-of-war scenario, the salami problem, and the spaceship questions. These examples helped students understand the relationship between force and mass, as well as the concept of inertial and non-inertial reference frames. The use of free body diagrams also resonated with students, who appreciated the real-world applications and visualizations of the laws. Overall, students found the lecture to be engaging and helpful in reinforcing their understanding of Newton's Laws."
102,"SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of centripetal force to be confusing, particularly in relation to circular motion and acceleration. Some struggled to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center, while others found it challenging to conceptualize how centripetal force is caused by different forces, such as friction or normal force. The application of centripetal force in various problems, including those involving drag force and terminal velocity, also caused confusion.

when assignment 18 was supposed to be due
Nothing
Constraints versus metrics
it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it

It was interesting to learn about histograms.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the interest in histograms and the hands-on experience of creating and formatting them in Excel. This could be condensed into a single sentence, e.g., ""Students found the topic of histograms particularly interesting, appreciating the hands-on experience of creating and formatting them in Excel.""

2. To focus more on the topic of Histograms/Graphs/Charts, consider removing or rephrasing sentences that mention broader topics, such as the value of breakout rooms or the use of Excel in general. For example, the sentence ""Students also enjoyed learning about the different ways to utilize histograms to organize and display data"" could be rephrased to focus more specifically on the types of graphs and charts discussed.

3. To make the summary more focused on the key takeaways, consider highlighting specific concepts or skills that students found interesting or valuable, such as understanding bin size and number of bins, identifying trends in split data, or comparing multiple sets of data. This could be done by rephrasing the summary to focus on these specific points, e.g., ""Students found the concepts of bin size and number of bins in histograms, as well as identifying trends in split data and comparing multiple sets of data, to be particularly interesting and valuable.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the topic of histograms, graphs, and charts to be particularly interesting, appreciating the hands-on experience of creating and formatting them in Excel.

 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms.

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.

 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time.

 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar student concerns, such as the uncertainty about creating or finding a conversion tool and the lack of clarity on the word document requirements, into a single point. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the focus on the In-Class Activity, consider removing the mention of students appreciating the ample time provided, as this is not directly related to the clarity or confusion of the activity itself. This would help to maintain a clear focus on the topic.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the In-Class Activity, such as what the activity involved or what specific aspects of it were unclear to students. This would provide a clearer understanding of the issues and help to identify potential areas for improvement.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class activity confusing, with several expressing uncertainty about what was expected of them. Specifically, there was confusion about whether to create a conversion tool or find one online, and what specific details were required in the word document.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, while some students required additional clarification"" as it doesn't add new information and makes the summary slightly longer.

3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""However, some students initially found the concept and equation confusing, particularly with the fraction and determining when to include or exclude certain numbers"" to ""Some students found the payback equation confusing, specifically with the fraction and the inclusion/exclusion of certain numbers"" to make it more direct and focused on the equation.","REFINED SUMMARY: The payback calculation was generally well-received by students, with many finding it straightforward and easy to understand after the explanation and example problem.

There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

The value of the grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline needed more accuracy from the slide in class to the slide for the in class activity.
nothing
The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing 
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today's class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
 I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
 I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
 I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well. 
 The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
 I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
 For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number. 
 I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
 Nothing was confusing today.
 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
 Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward. 
 I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.
 More information on assignment 13 
 I thought the mix up between the bright space calculation and the in class presentation calculation for the in class assignment was confusing.
 I just thought it was confusing when the file was corrupted for the in class activity.
 I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
 The in class activity was confusing as to what we were supposed to calculate. 
 nothing
 I'm still confused on the environmental portion of A13. 
 I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low 
 I thought the class was straightforward and there was nothing really confusing about it
 My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
 Today's class was good. 
 The A13 environmental impact was somewhat confusing.
 the differences in grams of CO2 per gallon of gas
 The in class activity had wrong numbers.
 At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2. 
 Nothing i'm doing pretty well
 The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
 nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
 Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
 The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing 
 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.
 Nothing was confusing

 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""A few students also mentioned that their initial confusion was resolved after the issue was addressed"" as it doesn't add significant new information and makes the summary slightly longer.

2. To focus more on the topic of Midterm/Exam, rephrase the summary to directly state what the students were confused about, such as ""Several students expressed confusion and concern regarding discrepancies in their midterm scores and sought clarification on their performance.""

3. Consider adding a specific detail from the reflections to make the summary more specific and representative of the students' concerns, such as ""Some students mentioned that their midterm grades were lower than expected, while others were unsure about the criteria used to evaluate their performance.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion and concern regarding discrepancies in their midterm scores, with some mentioning that their grades were lower than expected and others seeking clarification on the criteria used to evaluate their performance, highlighting a need for clearer communication about exam grading and feedback."
131,"SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture clear and helpful, with some expressing appreciation for the interactive nature and detailed explanations. However, several students expressed confusion or a desire for more information on specific aspects of the homework and project directions, including the BikeShare project, assignment due dates, and the use of Brightspace and CATME. Some students also requested a consolidated calendar or schedule to keep track of assignments and due dates. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the group formation process and whether their groups would remain the same throughout the semester.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17 because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outline document. Jeff was able to clear it up at the end
I think it could have been nice to do the weighted decision matrix, and actually do ine as a in-class activity
How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer! 
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards. 
 The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
 Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.
 Im super confused on the project we are doing. My group and kept asking questions. I think everything else was straight forward. 
 You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.
 I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
 how to fill out the tables in assignment 17 correctly 
 I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete. 
 The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
 It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
 Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
 I thought that class was rather straightforward, however I had trouble finding bio imitation ideas for the project.
 I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thought we needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
 It would have been nice to have mor information on how to generate prototypes using biomicry.
 I was confused about which parts were due on Friday for the project and felt like it wasn't very clear what our team was supposed to do and turn in.
 I'm confused on if i have to cite my sources for pictures i took myself.
 nothing
 Trying to find what all was due in class 10b
 Nothing, the explanation of idea generation was clear and informative.
 I found the most confusing part to be the pros and cons list about each coffee maker as I am unsure of what they were since I don't really drink coffee.
 There was no confusing portion of the class
 I did not feel confused by anything from today. 
 It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class. 
 when assignments are due
 I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
 What a french press is
 The most confusing part today was which sections of the assignment were ur on Friday
 There was nothing confusing today.
 A17
 nothing
 I was confused about the need for 8 to 12 solutions 
 Biomimicry was a little confusing 
 Part 5, the iteration section
 The in class activity  
 The feedback on A12 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing
 A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn't been graded yet so my group doesn't know how to do an assignment before the information required has been provided.

A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.","Suggestions:
1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about the iteration section and the feedback component, into a single statement. For example, ""Many students were unclear about the iteration section, including what it meant, how to do it, and how to incorporate feedback into part 5.""
2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""particularly with regards to the expectations and requirements"" as it is too general and does not add specific information about Assignment 17. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of A17 that caused confusion, such as the number of idea generation techniques, filling out tables, and the prototype.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to group similar types of confusion together, such as confusion about the project components (e.g., iteration, feedback, prototype) and confusion about the process (e.g., filling out tables, using feedback). This can help to create a clearer structure and make the summary easier to follow.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 17 (A17) to be confusing, specifically regarding the project components and process. Some students were unclear about the iteration section, including what it meant, how to do it, and how to incorporate feedback into part 5. Others were confused about the number of idea generation techniques to use, how to fill out the tables, and what parts of the project to complete. Additionally, there was confusion about the prototype, with some students unsure if they needed to create a physical prototype or just a drawing, and uncertainty about the feedback component, including where it was coming from."

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.

 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point.

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

 I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear. ",205,"I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linearregression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how thatregression works.
I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient offriction of each material but I was lost because it doesn’t say whetherto make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on thechart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient offriction of each material.
I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand.
I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 wasconfusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize theequation in a volume vs height form.
I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been alittle longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusionthat I had in today’ class.

The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture on regression to be clear"" and instead focus on the specific areas of confusion. This will help to streamline the summary and get straight to the points that need improvement.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Regression, consider removing the mention of the laminar approach and assignment A10, as these seem to be tangential to the main topic. Instead, focus on the specific regression concepts that caused confusion, such as the use of SSE, SST, and r values, and the difference between r and r^2 values.

3. To provide a clearer picture of the students' understanding of regression, consider adding more specific details about the concepts that were well-received, such as the examples and explanations provided in the lecture. This will help to give a more balanced view of the students' understanding of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding specific regression concepts, including the use of SSE, SST, and r values to analyze data, as well as the difference between r and r^2 values and their applications. Some students found the instructions for assignments related to regression to be unclear, leading to confusion about what was expected of them. However, many students appreciated the examples and explanations provided in the lecture, which helped to clarify their understanding of regression."
149,"SUMMARY: Many students found aspects of Assignments 10 and 11 to be confusing, particularly with regards to the laminar approach and its application in the assignments. Several students expressed difficulty in understanding how to use the laminar approach to calculate volume and height, and some found the instructions for Assignment 10 to be unclear. Additionally, some students were confused about specific parts of the assignments, such as Part 5 of Assignment 10 and the calculation of regression constants.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture clear"" as it's not directly related to the topic of Exam Prep. Instead, focus on the specific concerns and confusions mentioned by the students.

2. To improve the focus on Exam Prep, rephrase the sentence ""Some also requested more information on how to prepare for the exam, such as access to previous exams for studying"" to ""Some students requested more information on exam preparation, including access to previous exams or more detailed instructions.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider replacing the phrase ""specific topics that they found confusing"" with the actual topics mentioned by the students, such as ""the calculation of pressure head and volumetric flow rate, as well as the use of Excel for A12.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding exam preparation, citing unclear instructions and a desire for more detail.

 I was confused as to why we had so much time in studio time with very little explanation as to what the time was meant for. Also, I did not see how the slides connected with the project.

 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.
Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confusedif we need responses from people or if we should generate themourselves.
I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16.
Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts ofthe last three parts was confusing because different documents saiddifferent things
Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
It was confusing as to what what due before class started because theBrightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Thingsto do before class.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, a few students mentioned"" and instead, incorporate the mentioned points directly into the main sentence, e.g., ""Many students found the deliverables for Assignment 16 (A16) to be confusing, citing inconsistent messages in different places on Brightspace, unclear expectations, open-endedness of the assignment, and confusion about the project's goal.""

2. To improve focus on the topic Deliverables, consider rephrasing the sentence to specifically highlight the types of deliverables that caused confusion, e.g., ""Many students found the deliverables for Assignment 16 (A16), specifically the problem statement, stakeholder research, and task requirements, to be confusing due to inconsistent messages and unclear expectations.""

3. To enhance clarity, consider breaking the summary into two sentences to separate the main point from the specific examples, e.g., ""Many students found the deliverables for Assignment 16 (A16) to be confusing. Specifically, they struggled with inconsistent messages on Brightspace, unclear expectations, and open-endedness of the assignment, particularly regarding stakeholder research and task requirements.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the deliverables for Assignment 16 (A16) to be confusing, specifically the problem statement, stakeholder research, and task requirements, due to inconsistent messages on Brightspace, unclear expectations, and open-endedness of the assignment.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.

 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project.

I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting.

This rephrased sentence is more direct and clearly relates to calculations.

3. Consider removing the sentence ""Some students also mentioned that they needed more examples and explanations to understand the calculations, and that the pace of the class was too quick for them to fully grasp the concepts.""

Everything about prototyping all made sense.
Nothing was confusing in class, but I am waiting on the slides being posted to brightspace to review what was discussed at the beginning.
How we are supposed to collect data for our prototypes
I was confused on how to create prototypes on abstract ideas.
I didn't find anything confusing about today's class.
I was confused by how we were supposed to make a prototype of our ideas without being together. Also some of our ideas are not able to be made easily by students.
 I was confused on if we do prototypes on three seperate solutions or three prototypes on the same solution
 I found the buildable prototype part to be a little confusing as I do not have many materials available to make prototypes. 
 Everything is pretty clear!
 I was a little confused on how we are supposed to make a prototype with everything going on but it was talked about in great detail to help me understand.
 I would have liked to go over how to use 3D design programs and which ones are best.
 the consistency between the powerpoints and the doc is bad sometimes 
 I think everything in class seemed straight forward and for the most part we worked on the assignment and asked questions as we went.

I was confused about assignment 18 and the prototypes.","Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Prototyping/Creating Prototypes, consider removing the mention of using specific tools like 3D design programs and Citrix receiver, as these are more related to the implementation of prototyping rather than the concept itself. This would help to maintain a clearer focus on the core topic.

2. The summary could be made more concise by combining similar points, such as the confusion around creating prototypes for abstract ideas, system-based solutions, and without physical materials. This could be rephrased as ""some students struggled with adapting prototyping to non-physical or abstract concepts.""

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""A few students were unclear about the number of prototypes to create and whether they should be for separate solutions or the same solution"" to something like ""some students were uncertain about the scope and application of their prototypes."" This would help to maintain a focus on the concept of prototyping itself, rather than the specifics of the assignment.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of prototyping clear, but some struggled with adapting it to non-physical or abstract concepts, such as system-based solutions or ideas without tangible materials. Confusion arose around collecting data for prototypes, testing online prototypes, and understanding the scope and application of their prototypes. Some students were uncertain about how to effectively create and utilize prototypes in the given constraints, highlighting areas for further clarification and support in the prototyping process."

 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet

 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.

 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.

We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slideabout the calculations for the participation’s other than to try totrip us up.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us butit seemed meaningless.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity.
It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with some assuming it was irrelevant or intended to be misleading"" as it adds extra information that is not directly related to the main point of the summary. The revised sentence could be: ""Several students expressed confusion about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity.""

2. To improve focus on the topic, consider rephrasing the summary to directly state the students' concerns about gasoline density, rather than using general phrases like ""did not understand why the density of gasoline was included in the calculations."" A possible rephrased sentence could be: ""Some students questioned the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity, feeling it was unnecessary information.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding a direct quote or paraphrasing a specific student's comment to illustrate the point. For example: ""One student noted that 'we calculated it without it,' implying that the inclusion of gasoline density was unnecessary for the task at hand.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity.

176,"SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on engineering failures to be the most engaging aspect of the class, particularly the case study of the Taum Sauk reservoir. They appreciated learning about the various causes of engineering disasters, including negligence, lack of ethics, and poor communication. Many students noted that even small flaws in design or oversight can lead to catastrophic failures, highlighting the importance of attention to detail and responsible engineering practices. The examples of real-world engineering failures helped students understand the significance of learning from past mistakes and the need for diligence and accountability in their future careers.",Engineering Failures,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.

 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
 I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred. 
 What was interesting about today's class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster. 
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""They noted that the reservoir's failure was caused by multiple factors, including design flaws, communication issues, and cost-cutting measures."" and instead, focus on the key takeaway that the reservoir's failure was a result of negligence and lack of proper ethics. This will help to streamline the summary and maintain its focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir.

179,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding various aspects of Assignment 10 and In-Class Activity 10, particularly with the instructions and expectations. Many found the directions unclear, especially regarding the mathematical modeling, laminar approach, and the scope of the project. Some students struggled to understand what was required for parts 4 and 5 of the assignment, and how to apply the laminar approach. Additionally, there was confusion about the sources to be used, with some students unsure about what constitutes a reliable source and how to cite them properly. Several students also reported difficulty in understanding the Taum Sauk reservoir project and the requirements for the technical brief.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the multiple mentions of confusion regarding the laminar approach and mathematical modeling. This can be condensed into a single point, e.g., ""Many students found the instructions for parts 4 and 5 of Assignment 10 unclear, particularly regarding the mathematical modeling and laminar approach.""

2. To improve focus on the topic, consider removing the mention of the Taum Sauk reservoir project and the technical brief, as these are not directly related to Assignment 10 and In-Class Activity 10. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of the assignment that caused confusion, such as the instructions, expectations, and sources.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider providing more details about the types of sources that caused confusion, such as the distinction between scholarly sources and general information sources. This can help to clarify the specific areas where students need more guidance, e.g., ""Some students were unsure about the difference between scholarly sources and general information sources, and how to determine which sources are reliable for the assignment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding Assignment 10 and In-Class Activity 10, particularly with the instructions and expectations. Many found the directions unclear, especially regarding the mathematical modeling and laminar approach in parts 4 and 5.

I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""and apply the concepts learned to real-life examples"" as it is not directly related to the topic of groupwork. This phrase can be inferred from the context, but it's not essential to the summary.

2. To make the summary more focused on groupwork, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Several students appreciated the clarity and organization provided by the group work assignments"" to ""Students appreciated the clarity and organization provided by the group work assignments in helping them understand their roles and responsibilities within the group"". This rephrased sentence is more specific to groupwork and highlights the benefits of group work assignments.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two sentences ""Additionally, students enjoyed the opportunity to work with their teams during studio time, finding it to be a valuable and productive experience"" and ""Many students found the breakout group activities and in-class work on the assignment to be the most interesting and productive aspects of the lecture"" into one sentence, such as ""Students found the breakout group activities, in-class work, and studio time to be valuable and productive experiences that allowed them to work collaboratively and effectively"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the breakout group activities, in-class work, and studio time to be valuable and productive experiences that allowed them to work collaboratively and effectively.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the multiple mentions of z-scores and probability. For example, the summary could state that ""many students found the concepts of z-scores, probability, and their applications (e.g., calculating z-scores, applying probability to histograms) to be confusing.""
2. To improve focus on the topic of Statistics and Probability, the summary could omit mentions of non-statistics topics, such as the organization of assignments in Brightspace or the use of breakout rooms. While these issues may be relevant to the students' overall experience, they are not directly related to the topic of Statistics and Probability.
3. To provide more clarity, the summary could specify which aspects of the bell curve and normal distribution were unclear to students. For example, it could state that ""students were unsure about how to determine if a distribution is similar to a normal distribution and when to use z-scores, and would benefit from more detailed explanations of these concepts.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concepts of z-scores, probability, and their applications (e.g., calculating z-scores, applying probability to histograms) to be confusing, particularly in the context of the skittle example and Assignment 8.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.

201,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of biomimicry, particularly the use of nature to create solutions to design problems, to be a unique and interesting approach. Many enjoyed learning about the various methods for generating ideas, such as using Google to find patents and exploring different types of problem-solving. Breakout group time and idea iteration studio sessions were also well-received, allowing students to brainstorm possible solutions and work collaboratively. The application of biomimicry in real-world examples, such as the beetle research and snake-inspired designs, sparked interest and engagement among students.",Idea Generation and Brainstorming,"It was interesting seeing how humans are making technology that mimics animals.
Something interesting was the quiz in class, I enjoyed it and think I did well.

It was interesting to finish the quiz and get it over with.
Nothing was that interesting in today's class. The topics discussed were neutral.
The breakout group time we had to work with out groups 
I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions 
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
What I found most interesting about today's class was how much processing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used to create a solution. 
I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.
 I enjoyed the class it really is starting to seem like we are learning stuff that is going to be very important to us. I was also very excited to learn that A16 was not part 4 like we thought
 Learning about different types of problem solving
 I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
 I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
 I thought the beetle video was interesting because it was happening at Purdue and the way nature adapted was cool.
 Using Google to find patents and how it is all public information. 
 I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
 Even though the use of biomimicry was a little confusing, I did find how it was used in the video to be incredibly interesting!
 I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class. 
 The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering. 
 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before. 
 It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
 The prompt for the quiz was interesting.
 I enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of beetle shells used to make very strong force resistant shells.
 I found the idea iteration studio time interesting because it was fun to brainstorm possible solutions.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""such as using Google to find patents and exploring different types of problem-solving"" as it's not a major point and can be inferred from the rest of the summary. This would help to focus on the main ideas of biomimicry and collaborative brainstorming.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""Breakout group time and idea iteration studio sessions were also well-received, allowing students to brainstorm possible solutions and work collaboratively"" to ""Students appreciated the hands-on experience of generating ideas through breakout group time and idea iteration studio sessions"". This rephrasing puts more emphasis on the idea generation aspect.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider removing the phrase ""The application of biomimicry in real-world examples, such as the beetle research and snake-inspired designs, sparked interest and engagement among students"" and instead, integrate the idea of real-world examples into the first sentence, for example: ""Students found the concept of biomimicry, particularly the use of nature to create solutions to design problems, as seen in real-world examples, to be a unique and interesting approach"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of biomimicry, particularly the use of nature to create solutions to design problems as seen in real-world examples, to be a unique and interesting approach.

What we needed to do in part 6.a and 6.b","Suggestions: 

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing the first sentence to focus more specifically on Part 6 of Assignment 12, as that is the main area of confusion. For example, ""Many students were unclear about specific aspects of Part 6 of Assignment 12, including the selection of time intervals and calculations for flow rate.""

2. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points. For example, the points about flow rate and instantaneous flow rate could be combined into a single sentence, such as ""Some students found the calculations for flow rate, including instantaneous flow rate, to be unclear.""

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the mention of Part 7 of the assignment, as it is not the primary focus of the reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students were unclear about specific aspects of Part 6 of Assignment 12, including the selection of time intervals, with some questioning whether to make rough estimates based on the graph or use specific intervals. Some students found the calculations for flow rate, including instantaneous flow rate, to be unclear, and a few were unsure about what to do with the linear regression line in Part 6."
206,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of flow rate to be somewhat confusing, particularly with regards to calculating instantaneous flow rate and determining time intervals. Some students expressed a desire for more clarity on how to calculate volumetric flow rate and what values to use, while others were unsure about how to apply the linear regression line in their calculations. Additionally, a few students mentioned difficulties with formatting their graphs of flow rate and finding the potential errors with different methods of finding the slope of a line.",Flow Rate,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.

 I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
 The length of the time periods
 I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day. 
 The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
 My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn't.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?
 The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough
 nothing today
 There was nothing particularly confusing with today's class. The thing that needed more details was the use of the excel file to find the flow rate. 
 Everything was clear and well explained in today's class
 I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
 It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use 
 Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
 How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.
 Nothing.
 no confusion
 I was confused as to what we should do with the linear regression line in number 6. 
 Nothing we just did the taum sauk assignment
 Nothing was confusing today
 I wasn't sure exactly where to start on the assignment 12. My group was very confused when we went to studio time, and we didn't have a pt or gta come into our breakout session to help us out.

It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting

 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",411,"The executive summary part of A16
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, there was confusion about"" and instead, integrate the points about criteria, constraints, and stakeholders into the main sentence about Assignment 16. This will help to streamline the summary and focus on the main points.

2. To improve the focus on Assignment 16, consider rephrasing the sentence about the workload and deadline to specifically mention Assignment 16. For example, ""Some students found the workload and short deadline for Assignment 16 to be overwhelming.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific sections of Assignment 16 that caused confusion, such as ""Some students were unclear about the requirements for sections II, III, and IV, and whether all of these sections were due for the first milestone."" This will help to provide a clearer picture of the specific challenges students faced with Assignment 16.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the details and requirements of Assignment 16 to be confusing, including the specific sections due (II, III, and IV), the amount of work required, and the submission guidelines. Some students were unclear about what was expected for the first milestone, and others were overwhelmed by the workload and short deadline for Assignment 16. The assignment's requirements, particularly the differences between criteria and constraints, and the process of identifying and incorporating stakeholders, also caused confusion among students."
219,"SUMMARY: Students found the prototyping and testing aspects of the lecture to be the most confusing, particularly in terms of how to test virtual prototypes, what materials to use, and how to develop a testing protocol. Many students expressed uncertainty about how to create and test prototypes, especially when working in teams with members off-campus or without access to physical materials. Some students also struggled with understanding the level of detail required for prototypes and how to measure the success of experiments. Additionally, students found it unclear how to test CAD models and how to implement testing procedures for their designs.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in the context of the A17 assignment"" as it's not crucial to the main point about bio mimicry. This will help focus the summary on the topic of bio mimicry and its application.

2. To improve the clarity of the summary, consider rephrasing the sentence ""A few students also mentioned that they struggled to see the connection between bio mimicry and their project themes, which they found to be unrelated to the natural world"" to something like ""Some students found it challenging to relate bio mimicry to their project topics, such as campus mobility and road design, due to their perceived lack of connection to the natural world"". This will help to better convey the students' concerns and make the summary more focused on the topic.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""with several expressing difficulty in understanding how to apply it to their project"" and instead, directly state the students' concerns, such as ""Many students found the concept of bio mimicry confusing and struggled to see its relevance to their project topics"". This will help to get straight to the point and avoid unnecessary words.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of bio mimicry confusing and struggled to see its relevance to their project topics, such as campus mobility and road design, due to their perceived lack of connection to the natural world. Some students felt that more examples or explanations were needed to illustrate the application of bio mimicry in their specific projects, highlighting a need for clearer connections between the concept and their assignment themes."

1. To improve the summary, it would be beneficial to specify the equation used in the in-class activity that caused confusion among students, as this would provide more clarity on the exact issue. This could be done by rephrasing the sentence to include the specific equation, e.g., ""Some students struggled to understand how to apply the equation for calculating CO2 emissions in the in-class activity to the environmental analysis.""

2. The summary could be made more concise by combining the points about the calculations required for the activity.

3. To make the summary more focused on the in-class activity, it would be helpful to remove the phrase ""and how to apply the equation used in the activity to the analysis"" from the first sentence, as this begins to veer into the topic of the environmental analysis.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""various aspects of Milestone 1"" and instead focus on the specific areas of confusion, such as the approaches to find Vmax and Km, and the M1b activity. This will help to streamline the summary and make it more focused on the topic.

2. To improve clarity, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some struggled with understanding which CATME characteristic was being sought after"" to ""Some students were unclear about which CATME characteristic was relevant to the activity."" This will help to make the language more precise and easier to understand.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Milestone 1, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, some students were unclear about the instruction for part b of Milestone 1"" and instead incorporate this information into the sentence about the M1b activity. For example, ""Some students found the M1b activity challenging due to the noisy data and unclear instructions on how to evaluate approaches."" This will help to keep the summary focused on the specific topic of Milestone 1 and avoid introducing new ideas.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the approaches to find Vmax and Km in Milestone 1 confusing, particularly in rewriting these approaches. Some were unclear about which CATME characteristic was relevant to the activity. The M1b activity was also challenging due to the noisy data and unclear instructions on how to evaluate approaches, leading to difficulties in calculating Vmax and V0. Students sought more guidance on correcting their methods for noise and evaluating approaches in the milestone assignment."

When to use strong induction over weak induction","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""regular induction"" and instead use ""weak induction"" to maintain consistency with the students' reflections, which specifically mention ""weak induction"" as a point of comparison.
2. To improve focus on the topic of strong induction, rephrase the sentence about the transition from making a statement to applying it, as it's not entirely clear how this relates to strong induction specifically. Instead, emphasize the students' difficulties with understanding the process of strong induction, such as choosing base cases and creating a plan.
3. To provide more clarity, consider adding a phrase to explicitly state that students are struggling to understand when to use strong induction over weak induction, as this is a recurring theme in the reflections. This can help to further emphasize the areas of difficulty related to strong induction.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found strong induction to be a challenging concept, with many expressing uncertainty about determining the number of base cases required and when to apply strong induction versus weak induction. They struggled to understand the process of strong induction, including choosing the appropriate base case and creating a plan. Additionally, students were unclear about the differences between strong and weak induction, including when to use strong induction over weak induction, and questioned the naming conventions."
