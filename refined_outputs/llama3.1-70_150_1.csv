1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the points about setting up integrals and calculating potential from an electric field into one point, as they are closely related. This would help to eliminate some redundancy and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Potential, consider removing the mention of conductors, as it seems to be a tangential point that is not directly related to the concept of potential. This would help to keep the summary centered on the main topic.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific aspects of potential that students found confusing, such as the difference between voltage and potential energy, or the concept of setting the initial potential to zero. This would provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally struggled with understanding and applying the concept of potential, particularly in the context of electric fields and energy. A key area of confusion was setting up and solving integrals to calculate potential energy, including choosing correct bounds and determining the value of dq. Additionally, students found the relationship between electric fields and potential unclear, specifically the difference between voltage, potential energy, and regular voltage. The concept of dipoles and their potential energy, as well as when to set the initial potential to zero, also caused confusion. Students requested more examples and explanations of these topics to clarify their understanding of potential."

I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.

 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.

 For the first time ever in this class I feel like I actually understand all the cuvids for this section.
 I'd say power was the most confusing part. 
 Relating delta V=emf to delta V=IR
 I found it confusing how and what resistors actually do.  I find it confusing because I am doing calculations and finding numbers but don't know what they do. 
 More examples and discussion of differences between conductors, semiconductors etc 
 I was confused about how you can tell when resistors are in parallel/series
 It wasn't confusing, but I think going over Ohm's law and when you can and can't use it would be helpful 
 the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage. ",34,"I was a little confused about the last example in lecture for finding the voltage in each resistor because I wasn’t sure how the amps split in the circuit

1. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Resistors, consider removing the mention of batteries' internal and external voltage, as it seems to be more related to the topic of batteries rather than resistors specifically. This would help to streamline the summary and keep it centered on the topic of resistors.

2. The summary could be made more concise by combining similar points, such as the students' struggles with understanding series and parallel resistors, and how current splits in circuits. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more efficient.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Resistors, consider rephrasing the point about students struggling to understand the ""physical properties of resistors, including conductors and semiconductors"" to be more specific about how this relates to resistors. For example, students could be struggling to understand how different types of materials affect resistance, which would be more directly related to the topic of resistors.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found various aspects of resistors to be confusing, including understanding how current splits in circuits and how to distinguish between series and parallel resistors, which includes adding voltage in series. Some struggled with conceptual relationships, such as the connection between current and voltage, and how resistors affect voltage and current. Additionally, students expressed confusion about the role of resistors in circuits, including how different types of materials, such as conductors and semiconductors, affect resistance. A few students also mentioned that they struggled to understand the application of Ohm's law in relation to resistors. Overall, students need more clarification on the fundamental properties and behaviors of resistors in circuits."
35,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on capacitors to be clear, but several concepts caused confusion. Many students struggled with understanding charge distribution on capacitors in series versus parallel, and how to determine whether capacitors are in series or parallel. The concept of equivalent capacitance, particularly the difference between using the formula C1*C2/C1+C2 and the equations for parallel and series capacitance, was also a point of confusion. Additionally, some students found it unclear how to simplify circuit diagrams with multiple branches and how to set up integrals for current density. The distinction between series and parallel capacitors, including the calculation of equivalent capacitance, was a recurring theme of confusion among students.",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators
 The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.

1. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Capacitors, consider removing the mention of ""current density"" as it seems to be a tangential concept that was only mentioned by a few students. This will help to streamline the summary and concentrate on the main areas of confusion related to capacitors.

2. Instead of stating that students ""struggled with understanding charge distribution on capacitors in series versus parallel,"" consider rephrasing to specifically mention the calculation of equivalent capacitance for series and parallel capacitors. This will provide a clearer picture of the students' confusion and highlight the key concept that needs clarification.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the points about equivalent capacitance and the distinction between series and parallel capacitors into a single sentence.

I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school.

This would help to ground the summary in the students' own words and experiences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the groupwork aspect of the lecture to be a highlight, particularly the breakout rooms facilitated by Top Hat, which enabled collaboration, discussion, and peer-to-peer learning. Many appreciated the opportunity to ""think for themselves and still be able to get help if needed"" in a group setting, finding it to be ""a good use of time."" The interactive nature of the groupwork allowed students to work together, share perspectives, and learn from one another, with some noting that it was helpful to have ""a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs."" Overall, the groupwork experience was seen as engaging and helpful, with students enjoying the hands-on and interactive approach to learning."
53,"SUMMARY: The in-class problems were a highlight for many students, who appreciated the opportunity to work in groups and collaborate on problems using Top Hat and breakout rooms. Students found the interactive approach engaging and helpful in keeping them focused, and many enjoyed the hands-on practice and the ability to discuss ideas with peers. The use of real-life scenarios, such as the hockey and yeti problems, was also well-received, as it made the material more interesting and applicable. Additionally, students appreciated the review of answers and work during the breakout room sessions, which helped to clarify their understanding of the concepts. Overall, the in-class problems were seen as a valuable and enjoyable part of the learning experience.",In-Class Problems,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing. 
 How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got. 
 Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope
 The forces being internalized
 Forces between blocks

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""in the context of free body diagrams"" as it is already mentioned later in the summary, and instead, focus on the specific forces between objects that were challenging for the students.

2. To improve the focus on the topic Forces Between Objects, rephrase the sentence ""The example of a man pulling himself up with a pulley was a common source of confusion"" to specifically highlight the forces involved, such as ""Students struggled to understand the forces between the man and the pulley, particularly the doubling of tension forces.""

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the last two sentences into one, such as ""Students also found it difficult to determine the forces acting on multiple objects, such as blocks pushing on each other, and to define the system in these types of problems.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of forces between objects challenging, particularly when dealing with tension forces in pulley systems, where the doubling of tension forces was a common source of confusion. Many struggled to understand the forces between objects, such as the forces between the man and the pulley, and the forces between multiple objects, like blocks pushing on each other.

The noise produced when you push something across a surface is due to cold welds
I found cold welds interesting because I hadn’t heard about them (memorably) before
The cold welding and atomic interactions causing friction were cool","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""at the atomic level"" as it is mentioned multiple times in the original reflections, and instead, focus on the students' reactions to the concept of cold and hot welds. This will help to avoid repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic, consider removing the sentence ""Many were intrigued by the idea that friction is not solely dependent on surface area, but rather on the normal force and the coefficient of friction."" This sentence, while related to friction, is not directly related to cold and hot welds. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of cold and hot welds that students found interesting.

3. To make the summary more accurate, consider adding that some students found the concept of cold welds to be new and memorable, as mentioned in the original reflections. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' reactions to the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of cold and hot welds fascinating, particularly the idea that two surfaces can bond at the atomic level, contributing to friction. The explanation of cold welds was a new and memorable concept for some students, who were intrigued by how it contributes to the noise produced when pushing an object across a surface. Overall, the topic of cold and hot welds helped students develop a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of friction, with many students expressing interest in the concept and its relationship to normal force."

 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing 
 I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other.",68,"If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside

1. To improve the summary, it could be more focused on the specific aspects of reference frames that caused confusion, such as the distinction between inertial and non-inertial frames, rather than mentioning relative motion and phantom forces, which are related but distinct concepts.

2. The summary could also benefit from more specific examples of the types of problems or scenarios that students found confusing, such as the ""wrench in the car"" or ""tug of war"" examples mentioned in the reflections, to provide more context and clarity.

3. To make the summary more concise, some of the phrases could be rephrased or combined, such as ""Some students struggled to understand why objects appear to be moving differently relative to other objects, and how to distinguish between inertial and non-inertial situations"" could be condensed into ""Students had difficulty understanding how objects appear to move in different reference frames and distinguishing between inertial and non-inertial situations"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of inertial reference frames to be confusing, particularly in distinguishing between inertial and non-inertial frames. The explanation of inertial reference frames was considered unclear by some students, who would have liked more examples or further clarification on the topic. Specific examples that caused confusion included the ""wrench in the car"" scenario, where students struggled to understand why the wrench appears to be accelerating forward. Additionally, students found it challenging to apply the concept of inertial reference frames to problems, such as the ""tug of war"" example, where they had difficulty understanding how the forces interact in different reference frames. Overall, students would benefit from more examples and practice problems to solidify their understanding of inertial reference frames."
69,"SUMMARY: Many students found the centripetal force problems to be particularly engaging, specifically the examples involving terminal velocity, drag force, and real-life applications such as skydiving into water. The concept of acceleration in circular motion, even when velocity is constant, fascinated several students.

I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting
 I enjoyed learning about terminal velocity and how to solve for it.
 I liked the terminal velocity stink bug example! That was cool to work through",73,"What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation.

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

The right-hand rule was a significant point of confusion, with students struggling to apply it in 2D graphs and understand when it would be considered left-handed. These difficulties highlight the need for further clarification and practice in these specific areas of 3D graphing."

Some found the questions unclear or lacking in direction, while others struggled to understand the concepts behind them.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly

 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""in the lecture on Vectors and Directions"" as it is already implied by the focused topic. This will help to streamline the summary and focus on the key points.

2. To improve the focus on the topic Vectors and Directions, consider rephrasing the summary to explicitly mention vectors and directions. For example, instead of saying ""relative motion, particularly in 2D"", say ""vectors in relative motion, particularly in 2D, and understanding their directions"".

3. To make the summary more specific, consider breaking down the concept of relative motion into more specific aspects that students found confusing, such as ""determining direction relative to different perspectives"", ""understanding when to add or subtract vectors"", and ""conceptualizing relative speed"". This will provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found vectors in relative motion, particularly in 2D, and understanding their directions to be the most challenging aspect. Specifically, students struggled with determining direction relative to different perspectives, understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and conceptualizing relative speed, especially when an object is launched off a moving object with a horizontal initial velocity. Additionally, students had difficulty grasping the relationship between vectors in relative motion problems, such as the monkey and bullet example, and found the arrangement of subscripts/variables used in relative motion equations to be confusing."
86,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on vector math to be clear and easy to follow, but some struggled with specific concepts such as determining when to use sine or cosine, understanding the direction of resultant vectors, and subtracting vectors. Some students also expressed confusion about unit vectors, including their purpose and how to use them. Additionally, there were questions about how to determine the direction of vectors in different cases, particularly when finding the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. A few students also struggled with visualizing vectors and understanding how to apply the right-hand rule to the cross product.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the students' struggles with understanding the direction of resultant vectors and determining the direction of vectors in different cases. This could be condensed into a single point about difficulties with visualizing and understanding vector directions.

2. To focus more on the topic of Vector Math, consider removing the mention of the right-hand rule and cross product, as these concepts are not explicitly mentioned in the reflections as points of confusion. Instead, focus on the specific vector math concepts that students struggled with, such as subtracting vectors, unit vectors, and determining when to use sine or cosine.

3. To provide more clarity, consider adding specific examples or contexts from the reflections to illustrate the points of confusion.

Something that was confusing about today’s video lecture was how in somecases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’mnot sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that uhave to add 180 degrees.","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with trigonometric functions (sine vs cosine) and angle applications in different quadrants, into a single sentence. This would help to streamline the summary and focus on the main points.

2. To improve the focus on the topic of Angles, consider removing the sentence about the relationship between the direction of a resultant vector and its value, as this seems to be more related to vectors in general rather than angles specifically. Instead, focus on the specific angle-related concepts that students struggled with.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details or quotes from the student reflections to illustrate the types of angle-related difficulties they faced. For example, you could mention the specific example where the usual rule of adding based on the quadrant didn't work, or the types of problems where students were unclear about when to add or subtract 180 degrees.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion about angles, particularly in relation to trigonometric functions and their application in different quadrants. Some struggled to determine when to use sine versus cosine, and how to apply angles in different quadrants, with one student noting that the usual rule of adding based on the quadrant didn't work in an in-class example where they needed to subtract 360° instead. Additionally, students were unclear about when to add or subtract 180 degrees to an angle, with some mentioning difficulties in identifying when this is necessary, such as in cases involving inverse tangent. These angle-related difficulties highlight the need for further clarification and practice in applying trigonometric functions and working with angles in different contexts."
88,"SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion with the TopHat questions, particularly with determining when to add or subtract vectors, and understanding the direction of the resultant vector. Some students found the time limits and navigation within the TopHat platform to be challenging, while others appreciated the opportunity to practice and clarify their understanding through the questions. A few students mentioned that they would have benefited from a more detailed explanation of the incorrect answers and why they were wrong. Overall, the TopHat questions seemed to be a valuable learning tool, but some students required additional clarification and practice to fully understand the concepts being tested.",TopHat Question,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in the context of free body diagrams and solving problems"" as it is already implied in the rest of the summary. This would make the first sentence more direct and focused on the concept of redefining systems.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""This idea was illustrated through various examples, such as the pulley system and the Atwood machine problem, where redefining the system made it easier to solve for variables and calculate tension"" to focus more on how redefining systems helped in these examples, rather than the examples themselves. For example, ""Redefining systems allowed for easier calculation of tension and solution of variables in problems, as seen in the pulley system and Atwood machine examples.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider removing the last part of the sentence ""Students appreciated the flexibility in choosing the system and coordinates, as long as consistency was maintained, and found this concept to be a useful tool in solving complex problems"" and instead, integrate the idea of flexibility and consistency into the previous sentence.

 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.

 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where.

1. To make the summary more concise, it could be condensed into two main points: one focusing on the difficulties with complex systems involving multiple blocks, and the other highlighting the specific areas of confusion related to friction concepts, such as the difference between static and kinetic friction.

2. To improve focus on the topic of friction, the summary could avoid mentioning general difficulties with complex systems and instead delve deeper into the specific friction-related concepts that caused confusion, such as the interaction between blocks on top of each other, the purpose of fs,max, and the difference between static and kinetic friction.

3. To provide a clearer summary, it could be reorganized to group similar areas of confusion together, such as separating the difficulties with specific example problems (e.g., the top hat question, the problem with two blocks on a frictionless surface) from the conceptual difficulties with friction (e.g., understanding static and kinetic friction, the purpose of fs,max).","REFINED SUMMARY: 

The topic of friction was a point of confusion for many students, particularly when dealing with complex systems involving multiple blocks or objects. Students struggled to understand the interaction between blocks on top of each other, including determining the force needed to move or pull a block. Specific areas of difficulty included the concept of static and kinetic friction, with some students finding it hard to distinguish between the two and understand the purpose of fs,max. Additionally, students found it challenging to apply friction concepts to real-world examples and to create equivalent problems and diagrams. Examples that caused confusion included the top hat question with two blocks hanging from a pulley and the problem with two blocks on a frictionless surface."
96,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and objects in contact with each other. Many struggled with the last example in the lecture, which involved two blocks with friction between them, and had difficulty understanding how to combine the FBDs of the two blocks into one system. Some students also found it hard to determine the forces acting on each block and how to use the static friction coefficient to solve problems. Additionally, some students were confused about the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply these concepts to real-world examples. The complexity of FBDs with multiple objects and forces was a common theme in the students' reflections, indicating that this is an area where further clarification and practice are needed.",Free Body Diagrams,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.

I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.

WDM
The decision matrix
I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about distinguishing between criteria and metrics, and the uncertainty about how to assign numbers to metrics. This could be condensed into a single point, such as ""Many students struggled to understand the distinction between criteria and metrics, and how to assign and determine specific numbers for the metrics.""

2. To focus more on the topic of Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), consider removing or rephrasing points that are more related to the in-class activity or assignment, such as ""Others found the explanation of the WDM to be unclear, especially in the context of the in-class activity."" Instead, focus on the specific aspects of WDM that caused confusion, such as the criteria and metrics sections.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence ""However, a few students found the explanation of WDM to be clear and straightforward, and appreciated the in-class activity as a helpful exercise."" While this provides a positive perspective, it doesn't add much to the understanding of the common points of confusion, and could be removed to make the summary more concise and focused on the challenges students faced with WDM.","REFINED SUMMARY: 

The majority of students found the concept of Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) to be somewhat unclear or confusing. Many students struggled to understand the distinction between criteria and metrics, and how to assign and determine specific numbers for the metrics. Some students were also unsure about how to describe the scores for the criteria and how to choose the criteria. Additionally, the explanation of criteria with multiple metrics was a point of confusion for several students. Overall, the main challenges students faced with WDM were related to understanding the different components and how to apply them effectively."

 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.

 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing it to focus more on the specific aspects of the In-Class Activity that caused confusion, such as the conversion tool and the criteria and constraints. This would make the summary more concise and directly related to the topic.

2. Remove the phrase ""However, some students noted that they were able to clarify their doubts after discussing with their group members or the GTA"" as it slightly deviates from the main point of the summary, which is to highlight the areas of confusion.

3. Consider adding a sentence that summarizes the general sentiment of the students regarding the In-Class Activity, such as ""Overall, the In-Class Activity seemed to be a point of confusion for many students, with several expressing uncertainty about the expectations and requirements."" This would provide a clearer picture of the students' experience with the activity.","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion regarding the In-Class Activity, specifically with the conversion tool aspect, as some were unsure whether they were supposed to create one or find one online.

I did not understand where to find the CO2 data or what data specifically we were looking for.","Suggestions: 

1. To improve the summary's focus on Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation, consider removing the mention of the payback period explanation, as it is more relevant to the economic analysis aspect of the lecture. This will allow the summary to concentrate on the environmental impact and calculation aspects that students found confusing.

2. To make the summary more concise, combine similar student concerns into a single statement. For example, instead of mentioning ""determining CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library"" and ""calculating coal requirements"" separately, rephrase it as ""students struggled with calculating environmental impact metrics, such as CO2 emissions and coal requirements.""

3. To provide a clearer picture of student concerns, consider specifying the types of difficulties students faced with the environmental part of Assignment 13. Instead of stating that it was ""confusing,"" rephrase it to ""students had trouble with specific sections, such as the three-year payback yield section, and struggled to find and apply CO2 data.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on environmental impact and impact calculation to be clear, but some experienced difficulties with specific aspects. Students struggled with calculating environmental impact metrics, such as CO2 emissions and coal requirements, and had trouble finding CO2 data. The environmental part of Assignment 13 was also a source of confusion, with students having trouble with specific sections, such as the three-year payback yield section, and struggling to apply the required data. Some students requested more information or clarification on the environmental impact section, indicating a need for additional support in this area."

 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.

 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation. 
 I am not sure what the carbon footprint ya dot do with anything",130,"The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low
My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.

Where to find the midterm feedback.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, some students mentioned"" and instead combine the related points into a single sentence. For example: ""Several students expressed confusion and concern regarding their midterm grades, with some mentioning that their grades were initially incorrect but were later corrected, and others unsure about where to find their midterm feedback.""

2. To improve focus on the topic Midterm/Exam, consider rephrasing the summary to eliminate the phrase ""but the issue was resolved during class"" as it is not directly related to the midterm/exam topic. Instead, focus on the students' initial concerns and confusion.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the nature of the midterm grade concerns, such as ""Several students expressed confusion and concern regarding the accuracy of their midterm grades, with some mentioning that their grades were initially incorrect due to errors, but were later corrected.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion and concern regarding the accuracy of their midterm grades, with some mentioning that their grades were initially incorrect due to errors, but were later corrected.

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.

 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall"" and directly stating the main point. This will help to streamline the summary and focus on the key points.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Groupwork or Teams, consider rephrasing the sentence ""The fact that the project has a direct impact on their lives as students, specifically addressing campus mobility issues, made it more engaging and relevant"" to focus on how the group work aspect contributed to the students' engagement, rather than the project's relevance.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the group work activities that students found helpful, such as ""brainstorming with team members"" or ""discussing the project in breakout rooms"". This will provide a clearer picture of what aspects of group work were most effective.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the group work and team activities during the lecture to be the most helpful and interesting aspects of the class. They appreciated the time allocated to work on the project in class, which allowed them to stay motivated and make progress on the assignment. Specifically, students enjoyed brainstorming with team members, discussing the project in breakout rooms, and collaborating on problem scoping and idea generation. The group work aspect of the project fostered a sense of engagement and motivation, as students were able to work together to address a relevant campus issue. This collaborative approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the design process and allowed students to apply their skills in a practical and meaningful way."
136,"SUMMARY: Students found the design process to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture, particularly the problem scoping stage where they had to view the problem from various perspectives and consider the needs of users and clients. Many students enjoyed working on the project in class and appreciated the time to collaborate with their groups. The flexibility and open-ended nature of the project, which involves designing a solution to a campus-related problem, was also a point of interest for many students.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the second and third sentences, as they both discuss the benefits of problem scoping in the context of the project. For example: ""Students appreciated the opportunity to work on the project in class, generating ideas with their teams and developing a range of potential solutions, which helped them grasp the project and its relevance to their own experiences as students and the campus community.""

2. To maintain focus on the topic of Problem Scoping, consider removing the phrase ""and its application to the design project"" from the last sentence. This phrase slightly shifts the focus away from problem scoping itself and towards the broader design project. Instead, the summary could conclude with a sentence that reiterates the importance of problem scoping, such as: ""Overall, students were engaged by the problem scoping process and its value in considering multiple perspectives and viewpoints.""

3. To further emphasize the key points of interest, consider adding a phrase to highlight the specific aspects of problem scoping that students found most interesting.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture on regression to be clear"" and instead focus on the specific areas of confusion mentioned by the students. This would allow the summary to get straight to the point and highlight the key areas where students need more support.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of regression, consider removing the mention of assignments A10 and A11, and instead focus on the specific regression concepts that students found confusing, such as the laminar approach, R^2 values, and the difference between SST and SSE.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining similar points. For example, instead of mentioning ""calculating R^2 values"" and ""the difference between SST and SSE"" as separate points, consider combining them into a single point, such as ""students expressed confusion about regression metrics, including R^2 values, SST, and SSE.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion about specific aspects of regression, including the laminar approach, regression metrics (such as R^2 values, SST, and SSE), and constructing mathematical models.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students seemed to be looking for more clarity and guidance on how to effectively prepare for the upcoming exam"" as it is a general statement that can be inferred from the rest of the summary.

To improve focus on the topic Exam Prep, rephrase the sentence ""Some students found the exam instructions to be a bit confusing and wished for more specifics"" to ""Students found the exam instructions and expectations, such as what to expect on the exam, to be unclear and desired more specific information"".

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining the sentences ""Several students expressed a desire for more information on how to prepare for the exam, including more details on what to expect and access to previous exams for studying"" and ""a few students mentioned that they would have liked more review on the quiz material to help with exam preparation"" into one sentence, such as ""Students desired more information on how to prepare for the exam, including access to previous exams, more details on what to expect, and review of quiz material"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students desired more information on how to prepare for the exam, including access to previous exams, more details on what to expect, and review of quiz material.

 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""including what was expected for the problem scoping and stakeholder engagement components"" as it is somewhat redundant with the previous sentence and not directly related to deliverables. 

2. To improve focus on the topic Deliverables, rephrase the sentence ""Some students were unclear about the scope of the project"" to ""Some students were unclear about the deliverables for the project"" to keep the focus on deliverables.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider merging the last two sentences into one, for example: ""Some students found the open-ended nature of the assignment and the need to generate their own questions and responses within a short timeframe, as well as conflicting messages on Brightspace, to be confusing.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the deliverables for Assignment 16 (A16) to be confusing, with some expressing uncertainty about what specific tasks needed to be completed, what information was required, and how to obtain it.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""fostering a sense of community and interaction"" as it's implied through the descriptions of students sharing and receiving feedback on their drawings. This would help to streamline the summary and focus on the key points.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the activity seemed to effectively break the ice and set a positive tone for the course"" as it's more related to the overall class experience rather than the specific Draw and Engineer Activity. This would help to keep the summary centered on the activity itself.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students appreciated the opportunity to think creatively about the future of engineering and enjoyed the chance to discuss their ideas with others"" to something more specific, such as ""Students enjoyed exploring their thoughts on the future of engineering through the activity and discussing their ideas with peers.""

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students seemed to struggle with the application of mathematical concepts to solve problems and would benefit from more explanation and examples."" as it is somewhat of a conclusion and not a direct reflection of the students' thoughts. Instead, focus on summarizing the specific calculation-related issues mentioned by the students.

2. To improve focus on the topic of Calculations, rephrase the summary to directly quote or closely paraphrase the students' reflections. For example, instead of saying ""Several students mentioned struggling to understand the formulas and variables required for calculations,"" say ""Students were confused about the power equation and its variables, and the pressure head equation.""

3. Consider grouping similar calculation-related issues together in the summary, such as ""Calculations for in-class assignments and activities"" and ""Calculations for specific assignments (e.g. A10)"". This can help to create a clearer picture of the areas where students are struggling with calculations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion with various calculations in class, particularly with the power equation and its variables, as well as the pressure head equation. Many struggled to understand the formulas and variables required for calculations during in-class assignments and activities, such as the laminar approach and deriving equations from tables. Specifically, students were unclear about calculations for assignments like A10, including how to create mathematical models, find flowrates, and calculate volumes. Additionally, some students found the instructions for in-class activities, such as drawing simplified diagrams and labeling, to be unclear."

1. To improve the summary, it could be more concise by focusing on the specific aspects of assignment explanations and descriptions that caused confusion among students.

2. The summary could benefit from a clearer structure, separating the different types of assignment explanations and descriptions that caused confusion. For instance, it could have one sentence summarizing the issues with in-class assignment explanations, another sentence discussing the confusion around specific assignments like A10, and a third sentence addressing the difficulties with diagram and labeling instructions.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, it could avoid general statements about the need for ""more detailed explanations and examples."" Instead, it could highlight specific areas where students felt they needed more guidance, such as the laminar approach or deriving mathematical equations from tables.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found in-class assignment explanations and descriptions to be unclear, particularly with regards to specific tasks and expectations.

Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.

 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""One student noted that the extra information about gasoline density threw them off, while another wondered if it was meant to confuse them"" as it is somewhat redundant with the previous sentence and does not add significant new information.

2. To improve focus on the topic of Gasoline Density, consider rephrasing the summary to directly state the specific issue with gasoline density, such as ""Several students were confused about the relevance and purpose of including gasoline density in the in-class activity calculations, with some finding it unnecessary or unclear.""

3. To make the summary more focused, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity was a point of confusion for several students"" as it is somewhat redundant with the previous sentences and does not add significant new information.","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students were confused about the relevance and purpose of including gasoline density in the in-class activity calculations, with some finding it unnecessary or unclear.

The many failures that the designers and operators allowed to happen compounding in the overall failure of Taum Sauk.
I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
I found the reasons for dam failure to be quite captivating. That was a cool part of class to investigate those failures.
The destruction of Taum Sauk was very interesting because understanding adisaster is always very intriguing and interesting to look at.
finding the various reasons behind the reservoir failure was enjoyable
The failures of the Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting and the fact that cutting corners backfired
Taum sauk failure","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with many students finding the discussion of its engineering failures insightful and thought-provoking"" and instead, directly state the key points that students found interesting about the Tom Sauk Reservoir. This would help to focus the summary on the topic rather than the students' reactions.

2. To improve the focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, consider removing the sentence ""The discussion also emphasized the importance of learning from failures and the potential consequences of engineering errors, with many students appreciating the real-world connections and the opportunity to analyze the variables that contributed to the disaster."" While this sentence is relevant to the broader topic of engineering failures, it doesn't specifically add to the discussion of the Tom Sauk Reservoir.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, the summary could state that students found it interesting to learn about the various causes of the reservoir's failure, including design flaws, decision failures, and the compounding of mistakes by designers and operators, rather than breaking these points out into separate sentences.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Tom Sauk Reservoir was a major point of interest in the lecture, with students noting that its failure was a result of negligence, lack of proper ethics, and oversight. They found it interesting to learn about the various causes of the reservoir's failure, including design flaws, decision failures, and the compounding of mistakes by designers and operators. The reservoir's failure highlighted the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives, and students appreciated the opportunity to analyze the variables that contributed to the disaster."
179,"SUMMARY: Many students found the instructions for Assignment 10 to be unclear, particularly regarding the mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach. Some students were confused about what was expected of them in terms of the technical brief, with specific questions about the Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch and how to calculate the volume for the reservoir. Others were unsure about how to draw visual models using the Laminar Approach and requested more explanation or examples. Additionally, some students found the in-class activity confusing, specifically regarding how to find peer-reviewed or reliable sources and how to cite them properly. Several students also mentioned that they needed more time to complete the in-class assignment and had difficulty understanding the premise of the activity.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture

The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing the sentence ""A few students also mentioned that the introduction to the reservoir information was brief and could have been more detailed"" to ""Some students found the introduction to the Tom Sauk Reservoir project to be brief, which led to confusion about how the reservoir works."" This rephrased sentence is more concise and directly related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir topic.

2. The original summary mentions that students were unsure about the calculations involved, such as determining the volume of the reservoir. To make the summary more focused, consider specifying that this calculation is related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, e.g., ""Some students were unsure about the calculations involved in the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, such as determining the volume of the reservoir.""

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the sentences ""Many students found the concept of the 'laminar approach' and mathematical models unclear, and requested more explanation and examples to better understand the requirements"" and ""Some students needed more clarification on the specifics of the assignment and the reservoir project"" into one sentence, e.g., ""Students found the 'laminar approach' and mathematical models in the Tom Sauk Reservoir project unclear and requested more explanation and examples to better understand the requirements.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, specifically with the instructions for Assignment 10.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.

 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation

The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail sincethe module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for eachassignment, such as a read through of the instructions and theexpectation for each point.
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in classassignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment.But that is it.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about assignments 5 and 8, into a single statement. For example, ""Many students found the objectives, expectations, and instructions for assignments 5 and 8 to be unclear, with some noting that the PDFs provided did not contain sufficient information.""

2. To focus the summary more on the topic of ""Details Regarding Assignments"", consider removing the sentence about lectures not providing enough detail or practice with concepts. While this point is related to the assignments, it is more focused on the lectures themselves, and removing it would help to keep the summary more focused on the topic at hand.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific aspects of the assignments that were unclear. For example, instead of simply stating that students were confused about assignment 8, the summary could state that ""students were confused about how to handle missing data in Excel for assignment 8, and what was meant by 'addressing' the missing data."" This would provide a clearer picture of the specific issues students were facing.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the details regarding assignments 5 and 8 to be unclear, with some noting that the PDFs provided did not contain sufficient information about the objectives, expectations, and instructions.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?

 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""A few students also mentioned"" and instead, directly state the specific points of confusion, such as ""Some students struggled with finding the area under the curve and using z-scores.""
2. To focus more on the Skittles Example, consider removing the sentence ""Furthermore, some students were unclear about how to adjust the histogram values to percentages, and would have liked more examples shown through Excel to help with the assignment"" as it seems to be more related to the general assignment rather than the Skittles Example specifically. Instead, rephrase it to focus on the Skittles Example, such as ""Students were also unclear about how to adjust the histogram values to percentages in the context of the Skittles activity.""
3. To make the summary more focused, consider breaking it down into specific points of confusion related to the Skittles Example, such as ""Students were confused about: (1) switching x-axis values from numerical to percentages, (2) the objective of the Skittles activity, and (3) calculating the probability of a Skittles bag having over 27% yellow Skittles.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The Skittles Example was a topic of confusion for several students. Specifically, students were confused about: (1) switching x-axis values from numerical to percentages, (2) the objective of the Skittles activity, with some having to explain it to their group members, and (3) calculating the probability of a Skittles bag having over 27% yellow Skittles. Some students struggled with finding the area under the curve and using z-scores in the context of the Skittles example. Additionally, students were unclear about how to adjust the histogram values to percentages in the Skittles activity, highlighting the need for more practice and examples to solidify their understanding."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the group work component of the lecture was seen as a valuable learning experience"" and instead, integrate the idea of developing important skills for their future careers into the previous sentence about students developing their communication and problem-solving skills.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Group Work, consider removing the phrase ""The in-class activity, which involved evaluating pros and cons of different designs, was particularly helpful in generating and refining ideas"" as it seems to be more related to the topic of design and idea generation rather than group work specifically. Instead, focus on the aspects of group work that students found valuable, such as sharing ideas, learning from each other's perspectives, and working together towards a common goal.

3. To make the summary more specific and detailed, consider adding more specific examples or quotes from the student reflections to illustrate the points being made. For example, instead of saying ""students enjoyed the collaborative process of brainstorming, categorizing, and analyzing ideas"", you could say ""students enjoyed the process of 'coming up with ideas and seeing how their teammates' thoughts varied' and 'going over each other's ideas in depth and being able to talk them out'"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the group work and discussions during the lecture to be the most interesting and valuable part of the class.

Some students also struggled to understand how to incorporate stakeholders into the project and how to address them. Additionally, there was confusion about the project's goalposts and the timeline, with some feeling that the deadlines were too soon and the workload was too large. A few students also mentioned difficulties in understanding the differences between criteria and constraints, as well as identifying users and clients.",Projects,"nothing
There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about project scope and requirements, into a single sentence. For example, ""Students expressed confusion about the project's scope, requirements, and timeline, including the amount of work needed for the background information section and the specific sections due for Assignment 16.""

2. To improve focus on the topic of Projects, remove the mention of ""criteria and constraints"" as it seems to be a more general concept that was discussed in the class, but not directly related to the projects. Instead, focus on the specific project-related aspects that caused confusion, such as the project's goalposts, timeline, and stakeholder incorporation.

3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more specific to the project, rather than using general terms like ""some students also struggled"" or ""a few students also mentioned"". For example, ""Students struggled to understand how to incorporate stakeholders into the project, with some expressing confusion about how to address them and identify users and clients."" This makes the summary more concise and focused on the specific project-related issues.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion about the project's scope, requirements, and timeline, including the amount of work needed for the background information section and the specific sections due for Assignment 16.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally.

I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.

 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.

A few students also mentioned that they had limited experience with CAD and were concerned about learning it within a short timeframe.",CAD,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

1. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of CAD, consider removing the phrase ""concept of prototyping"" and instead directly state the challenges related to CAD. For example, ""Students found using CAD software for prototyping to be a challenging aspect of the lecture.""

2. To improve the clarity of the summary, consider breaking down the main points into separate sentences. This would allow for a more organized and easy-to-follow structure. For instance, one sentence could focus on the challenges of testing virtual prototypes, while another sentence could address the difficulties in determining the level of detail required for CAD models.

3. To make the summary more focused on CAD, consider removing or rephrasing sentences that mention general prototyping challenges. For example, the sentence ""Some students mentioned difficulties in understanding how to develop a testing protocol for their CAD models"" could be rephrased to focus specifically on CAD, such as ""Students struggled to understand how to develop a testing protocol for their CAD models, particularly in a virtual environment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found using CAD software for prototyping to be a challenging aspect of the lecture, particularly in terms of testing virtual prototypes.

2. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating redundant phrases. For example, the summary mentions that students ""found it challenging to come up with novel solutions"" and ""needed more guidance on how to effectively apply these concepts."" These ideas could be condensed into a single sentence that highlights the challenges students faced during the brainstorming process.

How to calculate environmental impact of the solar panels for a13","Suggestions: 

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing the first sentence to focus more on the specific calculations and analysis discussed in class, rather than general impressions of the lecture. For example, ""Many students found the calculations for environmental impacts, such as CO2 emissions, to be clear and straightforward.""

2. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with specific calculations. For example, ""Some students reported difficulties with calculations, including determining the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period, calculating CO2 emissions, and understanding the relevance of certain values like gasoline density.""

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Calculations/Analysis, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in the context of Assignment 13"" and instead focus on the specific calculations and analysis that caused confusion. For example, ""A few students also expressed confusion about how to apply the calculations to the environmental analysis, specifically in terms of determining the sources of electricity generation to use when finding carbon dioxide emissions and how to calculate the environmental impact of solar panels.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the calculations for environmental impacts, such as CO2 emissions, to be clear and straightforward.

 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

This could be rephrased as: ""Many students struggled with the coffee maker example, particularly those who don't drink coffee, and would have benefited from more background information on how the French press works.""

2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""Additionally, a few students mentioned that they were unsure about the level of detail required for the pros and cons diagram"" as it seems to be more related to the assignment rather than the in-class activity. Instead, focus on the specific challenges students faced during the in-class activity.

3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""A few students also mentioned that they would have benefited from more background information on the coffee makers, such as how a French press works, and some suggested that having access to more information or materials would have been helpful"" to make it more specific to the in-class activity. For example: ""Some students suggested that having access to more information or materials about the coffee makers during the in-class activity would have been helpful.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class activity on pros and cons to be somewhat confusing, particularly with regards to the coffee maker example. Those who don't drink coffee had difficulty relating to the example and coming up with pros and cons, and would have benefited from more background information on how the French press works. Some students suggested that having access to more information or materials about the coffee makers during the in-class activity would have been helpful, such as being told to use the internet to find information on the French press."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the project and teamwork aspects of the class have generated significant student interest and motivation"" as it's somewhat redundant and doesn't add new information. Instead, focus on summarizing the key points that students found interesting and engaging about the project and teamwork.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""The project's background and topic, incorporating chemical kinetics, were also of interest to many students"" to be more specific about what aspects of the project and teamwork students found interesting. For example, ""Students found the application of chemical kinetics to the project and the opportunity to work on a real-world problem to be particularly engaging.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, instead of having two separate sentences about students enjoying the process of writing a problem statement and planning their code, combine them into one sentence: ""Students found the process of writing a problem statement and planning their code step-by-step to be engaging and useful for their technical writing and presentation skills.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed enthusiasm for the project, appreciating the opportunity to apply their skills, particularly in MATLAB, to a real-world problem while working collaboratively with their teams.
