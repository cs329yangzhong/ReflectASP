 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.

I found the example of discharging a real battery a bit confusing as it is hard to recognize R and r. 
The group problems
I thought the examples at the end of the cuvids for the first set were a little confusing, I wasn't sure how the equations were derived
The conceptual tophat questions about current vs voltage were most confusing for me because I don't fully understand the relationship between the two. 
I think I actually understood this one well. The only thing I truly struggled was the second part with the battery, the E and the delta V
 Trying to figure out if things are in series or parallel
 For the first time ever in this class I feel like I actually understand all the cuvids for this section.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with understanding series and parallel resistors, and the challenges with conceptualizing voltage and current relationships. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the focus on the topic of Resistors, remove the mention of conductors and semiconductors, as this seems to be a tangential point that was mentioned by only one student. Instead, emphasize the specific aspects of resistors that caused confusion, such as how they function in a circuit and how to apply Ohm's law.

3. Consider rephrasing the summary to better capture the students' struggles with the fundamental understanding of resistors. For example, instead of stating that students found it ""confusing how and what resistors actually do,"" rephrase it to ""students struggled to understand the role and behavior of resistors in a circuit."" This would help to provide a clearer picture of the students' knowledge gaps and areas where they need more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the fundamental behavior and role of resistors in a circuit, including how current splits and voltage is added in series.

 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero.

Additionally, many students enjoyed seeing the real-world applications of the kinematic equations and how they could be used to solve problems involving relative motion, free fall, and circular motion.",Problem Solving or Picking Equations,"Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same.
I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.

Instead, focus on the aspects of groupwork that students enjoyed, such as discussing ideas, collaborating on problems, and staying engaged.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details from the reflections, such as the specific mention of breakout rooms and Top Hat questions, to provide a clearer picture of what the groupwork entailed and how it contributed to the students' positive experiences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the groupwork aspect of the lecture to be a highlight, particularly the use of breakout rooms and Top Hat questions, which allowed them to work in groups of 4, discuss ideas and processes with peers, and collaborate on problems. They appreciated the opportunity to think for themselves, get help when needed, and stay engaged with the material. The interactive nature of the groupwork, facilitated by breakout rooms and Top Hat questions, was seen as a key factor in their enjoyment and understanding of the material. Students enjoyed the hands-on approach, which enabled them to work together and deepen their understanding of the material in a collaborative and engaging environment."
53,"SUMMARY: Students found the in-class problems engaging and interactive, particularly when working in breakout rooms and using Top Hat. Many appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with peers, discuss ideas, and receive help when needed. The problems themselves, such as the hockey and yeti questions, were seen as thought-provoking and relevant to real-world situations. Students also enjoyed the hands-on approach, which helped them understand and apply the material. The use of visual aids, like drawings and triangles, was also praised for making complex concepts more accessible. Overall, the in-class problems were seen as a valuable way to practice and reinforce learning, and students appreciated the variety of problem types and notations presented.",In-Class Problems,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

 How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing. 
 How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got. 
 Free body diagrams, in particular, the guy sitting and pulling the chair up the rope
 The forces being internalized
 Forces between blocks
 Something that was confusing was the force between two blocks pushed together. 
 I found the last one clicker question confusing with how to define the system.
 I found the reasoning behind the man lifting himself with w/2 to be confusing
 force between multiple objects due to each other
 The links between various objects with strings of different tensions and acceleration directions were most confusing.",60,"Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks.It’s just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""such as the doubling of tension forces in pulley systems and the direction of forces between objects"" and instead, focus on the main idea that students struggled with the representation of forces in free body diagrams. This will help to streamline the summary and avoid unnecessary details.

2. To improve the focus on the topic Forces Between Objects, rephrase the sentence ""The concept of multiple tension forces and how to set up free body diagrams for systems with multiple objects, such as blocks or masses, was also a point of confusion"" to ""Students struggled to understand forces between multiple objects, including how to set up free body diagrams and determine the forces acting on each object."" This will help to emphasize the topic of forces between objects and avoid mentioning specific examples that may not be directly related to the topic.

3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Additionally, students found it difficult to understand how to determine the forces acting on objects in systems with multiple masses or blocks, and how to solve for variables in these types of problems"" to ""Students also struggled with determining the forces between objects in complex systems and solving for unknown variables.""

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the topic of cold and hot welds was a highlight of the lecture for many students"" as it is somewhat redundant and doesn't add much new information. Instead, focus on summarizing the key points that students found interesting about cold and hot welds.

2. To improve focus on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""The explanation of cold and hot welds helped students to better understand the relationship between normal force and friction, and how friction works at a molecular level."" to focus more specifically on cold and hot welds, such as ""Students found the explanation of cold and hot welds to be particularly insightful in understanding the atomic-level interactions that cause friction.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, instead of having two separate sentences stating that students found the concept of cold welds interesting and that they hadn't previously learned about it, consider combining them into a single sentence: ""Many students found the concept of cold welds to be particularly interesting, as it was a new and fascinating concept that they had not previously learned about.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of cold and hot welds to be particularly interesting, with many noting that they had not previously learned about cold welds. The idea that friction is caused by the formation of cold welds between two surfaces at the atomic level was a new and fascinating concept for many students. Students found the explanation of cold and hot welds to be particularly insightful in understanding the atomic-level interactions that cause friction, and how cold welds impact friction, allowing objects to move. The concept of cold welds provided a new perspective on the concept of friction, and students enjoyed learning about how they can be broken."

 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing 
 I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other.",68,"If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students mentioned that they had trouble picturing phantom forces and understanding the difference between inertial and non-inertial frames"" to make it more concise and focused on the topic of Reference Frames.

2. The summary could be more focused on Reference Frames by removing the phrase ""Additionally, some students found it challenging to apply the concept of reference frames to problems"" and instead, rephrase it to highlight specific examples related to Reference Frames, such as ""The concept of inertial reference frames was particularly challenging when applied to scenarios like the car example or the relative motion of the wrench.""

3.

What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting
 I enjoyed learning about terminal velocity and how to solve for it.
 I liked the terminal velocity stink bug example! That was cool to work through",73,"What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation.

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the difficulties with the right-hand rule and visualizing vectors in 3D space, into a single sentence. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more streamlined.

2. To improve focus on the topic of 3D Graphing, consider removing the mention of ""displacement, velocity, and acceleration"" from the summary, as this seems to be more related to a different topic (kinematics) and is not directly related to 3D graphing. Instead, focus on the specific challenges students faced with 3D graphing, such as visualizing vectors and determining direction.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific aspects of 3D graphing that students struggled with, such as ""visualizing the z-axis in a 2D representation"" or ""determining the direction of vectors using the right-hand rule in a 3D coordinate system"". This would help to provide a clearer picture of the challenges students faced and what they need more practice and clarification on.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found 3D graphing concepts, particularly visualizing vectors in 3D space and determining their direction, to be challenging. Many struggled to apply the right-hand rule to determine if vectors were pointing in or out of the screen and to visualize the z-axis in a 2D representation. Additionally, students had difficulty distinguishing between left-handed and right-handed orientations in 2D graphs. Overall, students would benefit from more practice and clarification on these specific aspects of 3D graphing to solidify their understanding."

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign.

 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture.

 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly

 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition

 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.

 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.

 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
 Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.",85,"This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with thetwo people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when dealing with vectors and directions"" as it is already implied in the focused topic, and instead, focus on the specific challenges students faced with vectors and directions, such as determining the correct direction relative to different perspectives.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic Vectors and Directions, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students also found the concept of relative motion from a moving reference point to be confusing"" to specifically highlight the vector-related aspects of this concept, such as ""Some students struggled to understand how to handle vectors in relative motion from a moving reference point.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider removing the mention of the ""monkey and hunter problem"" as it is not directly related to the topic Vectors and Directions, and instead, focus on the general challenges students faced with relative motion and vectors, such as understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and how to determine the correct direction relative to different perspectives.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found relative motion to be a challenging concept, especially when it comes to vectors and directions. Several students struggled to understand when to add or subtract vectors and how to determine the correct direction relative to different perspectives. Some students also had difficulty handling vectors in relative motion from a moving reference point, including understanding the arrangement of subscripts and variables used in relative motion equations and how to apply vector addition to two different reference frames. Overall, students need more clarification and practice with relative motion problems, specifically with vector-related aspects, to solidify their understanding of vectors and directions in this context."

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees tothe answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to dothat both before you answer the problem and after.
Something that was confusing about today’s video lecture was how in somecases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’mnot sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that uhave to add 180 degrees.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of ""when to add or subtract angles"" and ""when to add 180 degrees to an angle"" into a single point, as they are related concepts. This would help to eliminate some repetition and make the summary more streamlined.

2. To improve focus on the topic of Angles, consider removing the sentence about visualizing and drawing vectors, as it is somewhat tangential to the main topic. While it is related to vectors, it is not specifically about angles.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the specific contexts in which students struggled with angles, such as ""when using inverse tangent"" or ""when determining the direction of a resultant vector"". This would help to provide a clearer picture of where students are struggling and why.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion about angles in the context of vectors, particularly when determining the correct angle to use in calculations. Specifically, students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract angles, including when to add 180 degrees, and how to account for the quadrant in which the vector lies. This confusion arose in various contexts, such as when using inverse tangent and when determining the direction of a resultant vector. Overall, students seem to need more clarification and practice with working with angles in vector calculations to solidify their understanding of these concepts."
88,"SUMMARY: Many students found the TopHat questions to be a source of confusion, particularly in determining when to add or subtract vectors. Some students struggled with understanding the direction of the resultant vector and how to identify when to add 180 degrees to the answer. A few students also mentioned difficulties with navigating the TopHat platform, including submitting answers and understanding the time limits. However, after the explanation and discussion, many students reported gaining a better understanding of the concepts, and some appreciated the opportunity to practice and improve their skills.",TopHat Question,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students enjoyed the flexibility and creativity that comes with redefining systems in problem-solving"" as it's not directly related to the topic of Redefining Systems and seems to be a general statement. Instead, focus on summarizing the key points mentioned by the students.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""They appreciated how this approach can simplify problems, such as the Atwood machine problem and pulley systems, by changing the coordinate system or the way forces are analyzed"" to specifically highlight how redefining systems simplifies these problems, rather than just mentioning the approach in general.

3. To make the summary more precise, consider combining the ideas of redefining system boundaries and changing coordinates into a single sentence, as they are closely related concepts. For example, ""Students found it interesting that the system's boundaries and coordinates can be redefined to suit the problem, allowing for more efficient solutions.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of redefining systems to be particularly interesting, noting that it can make calculations faster by treating multiple objects as a single system. This approach simplifies problems like the Atwood machine and pulley systems by allowing students to redefine the system's boundaries and coordinates to suit the problem, enabling more efficient solutions. Students appreciated how redefining systems can change the way forces are analyzed, such as in pulley systems where tension can be halved. The idea that the system's boundaries and coordinates can be adjusted to suit the problem was a key takeaway, highlighting the flexibility of this approach in problem-solving."

 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",95,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction.

stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing

 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.

I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.

 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion

I’m confused on how centripetal force isn’t an actual force.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""and variables involved"" from the second sentence, as it's not entirely clear what variables are being referred to. Instead, focus on the specific forces that provide centripetal force, such as normal force or friction.

2. To improve focus on the topic of Centripetal Force, consider removing the mention of ""the drag force equation and the impact of density on terminal velocity"" from the third sentence. While these topics are related to circular motion, they are not directly related to centripetal force and may be distracting from the main point.

3. To clarify the concept of centripetal force, consider rephrasing the last sentence to explicitly state that centripetal force is a net force directed towards the center of the circle, rather than saying ""centripetal force is not an actual force."" This could help to avoid confusion and provide a clearer understanding of the concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of centripetal force to be confusing, particularly in relation to its application in circular motion and the direction of the acceleration vector. Some students struggled to understand how centripetal force can be provided by different forces, such as normal force or friction. The concept of centripetal force was often mentioned alongside difficulties with understanding circular motion, including the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion. To clarify, centripetal force is a net force directed towards the center of the circle, resulting from the combination of forces acting on an object in circular motion."

WDM
The decision matrix
I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first.","Suggestions:
1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points of confusion, such as the distinction between criteria and metrics, and the process of assigning numerical values to metrics, into a single statement. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), consider removing or rephrasing sentences that mention unrelated topics, such as the due date of assignment 18 or the format of the template. This would help to maintain a clear and consistent focus on the WDM.

3. To provide a clearer picture of the students' understanding of the WDM, consider adding a statement that highlights the positive feedback received, such as the fact that some students found the concept to be ""somewhat clear"" or ""actually explained very well."" This would provide a more balanced view of the students' reflections and help to identify areas where the instruction was effective.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) concept to be somewhat clear, but several areas of confusion were identified. A common point of confusion was the distinction between criteria and metrics, including how to assign numerical values to metrics and how to describe scores for criteria. Some students struggled to understand the application and benefits of the WDM, and a few were unsure about how to determine specific numbers for metrics. However, some students found the concept to be ""actually explained very well"" and appreciated the clarity of the instruction. Overall, the reflections suggest that while some students require further clarification on specific aspects of the WDM, the instruction has been effective in conveying a general understanding of the concept."

 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the uncertainty about creating a conversion tool or finding one online, and the lack of clarity on what to include in the word document. This can be condensed into a single point about the overall confusion surrounding the activity's expectations.

2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""A few students also mentioned that the activity was too vague and that they were not sure if they were doing it correctly."" This point, while related to the activity, is not as specific to the topic as the other points and can be removed to make the summary more focused.

3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more direct and to the point. For example, instead of saying ""The In-Class Activity was a source of confusion for several students,"" say ""Students were confused about the In-Class Activity's expectations and requirements."" This can help to make the summary more concise and easier to read.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were confused about the In-Class Activity's expectations and requirements, specifically whether they were supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online, and what to include in the word document.

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the mention of payback period calculations, as it is not directly related to the focused topic of Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation. Instead, focus on the specific challenges students faced with environmental impact calculations, such as determining CO2 emissions and coal requirements.
2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""A few students mentioned difficulties in understanding where to find specific CO2 data and what data to use"" to be more specific, such as ""Some students struggled to locate and identify the relevant CO2 data for the library's environmental impact calculation.""
3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, a few students requested more information on the environmental impact section and tips on certain parts of the project, such as capital investment equations"" as it is not directly related to the specific challenges students faced with environmental impact calculations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the economic analysis and calculations straightforward, but some struggled with the environmental impact calculations, particularly determining CO2 emissions and coal requirements for the library.

 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing
 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation. 
 I am not sure what the carbon footprint ya dot do with anything",130,"The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low
My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
Where to find the midterm feedback.","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, while some students had issues with their midterm grades, these issues were largely resolved, and the majority of students did not express ongoing confusion about the exam itself."" as it is not directly related to the focused topic of Midterm/Exam and seems to be a general conclusion.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""A few students also mentioned that they were initially confused about the exam grades, but the issue was resolved."" to ""Some students experienced initial confusion about their exam grades, which was later clarified."" to make it more specific to the midterm/exam topic.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with one student jokingly mentioning going through the stages of grief upon seeing their score"" as it is an anecdotal detail that, although adds a human touch, does not contribute significantly to the understanding of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion and concern regarding their midterm grades, with some mentioning that their grades were initially incorrect but were later corrected. Some students experienced initial confusion about their exam grades, which was later clarified. A few students also mentioned being surprised or disappointed by their exam scores."
131,"SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with some expressing appreciation for the interactive nature of the class and the detailed explanations provided. However, several students expressed confusion or a desire for more information regarding the homework and project directions. Specifically, some students were unclear about the BikeShare project, including its objectives and expectations. Others were uncertain about the due dates and organization of assignments on Brightspace, with some suggesting a consolidated calendar would be helpful. Additionally, a few students were unsure about the CATME assignments and the upcoming project schedule. A few students also inquired about the group formation and whether the groups would remain the same throughout the semester.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the students' confusion about the BikeShare project and the project schedule, into a single point. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the focus on the topic of HW and Project Directions/Instruction, consider removing or rephrasing sentences that touch on other topics, such as the interactive nature of the class or the students' appreciation for the detailed explanations. While these points are relevant to the overall lecture, they are not directly related to the topic of HW and Project Directions/Instruction.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider providing more details about the types of information that students were unclear about or desired more information on. For example, instead of simply stating that students were ""uncertain about the due dates and organization of assignments on Brightspace,"" the summary could specify that they were unclear about how to navigate Brightspace to find due dates and assignments, or that they desired a consolidated calendar to help with organization.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture clear, but some expressed confusion or a desire for more information regarding homework and project directions.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""especially since the project is focused on a real-world issue on campus"" as it is not directly related to the topic of groupwork or teams. Instead, focus on the aspects of groupwork that students found engaging, such as collaboration, idea generation, and problem scoping.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students also enjoyed the freedom and flexibility of the project, which allows them to design their own solutions"" to focus on how this freedom and flexibility relates to groupwork. For example, ""Students appreciated the freedom to collaborate with their teams to design their own solutions.""

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, instead of saying ""Many students appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with their team members, generate ideas, and scope out problems together"" and ""Students found the process of problem scoping, discussing stakeholders and users, and coming up with solutions to be engaging and relevant"", consider combining these ideas into a single sentence such as ""Students found the collaborative process of generating ideas, scoping out problems, and discussing stakeholders and users to be engaging and relevant.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the group work and team activities to be the most helpful and interesting aspects of the lecture, particularly the time spent working on the project in class. They appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with their team members, generating ideas, scoping out problems, and discussing stakeholders and users, finding this collaborative process to be engaging and relevant. Students also valued the freedom to work with their teams to design their own solutions, and are excited to continue working on the project together."
136,"SUMMARY: Students found the design process to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture, with many appreciating the hands-on experience of working on the project in class and the freedom to design their own solutions. The problem scoping stage, in particular, was highlighted as a valuable learning experience, allowing students to view problems from various perspectives and understand the importance of clear feedback and questioning. Students also enjoyed learning about the different methods and processes involved in the design process, including the consideration of stakeholders and users, and the opportunity to apply their skills to a real-world problem relevant to their campus experience.

How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer! 
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards. 
 The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
 Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.

 I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete. 
 The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
 It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
 Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
 I thought that class was rather straightforward, however I had trouble finding bio imitation ideas for the project.
 I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thought we needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
 It would have been nice to have mor information on how to generate prototypes using biomicry.

To make the summary more focused on the topic of Feedback, consider removing the phrase ""particularly with regards to the iteration process and what was required for submission"" as it slightly deviates from the topic of feedback. Instead, focus on the students' confusion regarding the source and incorporation of feedback.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the sentence about the website that calculates the equivalent number of Earths needed, as it slightly deviates from the focused topic of Car CO2 Emissions. Instead, focus on the students' reactions to their car's carbon footprint and the hands-on activity.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Others appreciated the opportunity to learn about the environmental impact of their daily choices, including the CO2 emissions from their cars"" to specifically highlight the students' interest in car CO2 emissions. For example, ""Many students were surprised and interested to learn about the CO2 emissions from their own cars, despite some having 'good gas mileage'.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining the last two sentences into one, removing the phrase ""Overall"" and directly stating how the hands-on activity and real-world application of car CO2 emissions resonated with the students. For example, ""The hands-on activity and real-world application of car CO2 emissions resonated with the students, helping them understand the significance of their personal impact on the environment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the activity of calculating their car's carbon footprint to be particularly interesting, with some expressing surprise at the large amount of CO2 emissions their vehicles produce despite having ""good gas mileage.""

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.

 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better

The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.","Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, it could be more concise by focusing on the specific aspects of regression that caused confusion among students, rather than stating that students generally found the lecture clear. This would help to highlight the areas where students need more support.

2. The summary could benefit from a clearer distinction between the different types of regression-related confusion mentioned by students. For example, it could separate the confusion related to the laminar approach from the confusion related to data analysis (SSE, SST, r-squared values). This would help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the areas where students need more support.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of regression, it could avoid mentioning the enjoyment or appreciation of the lecture, and instead focus solely on the specific aspects of regression that caused confusion or required more explanation.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding specific aspects of regression, particularly the laminar approach in assignment A10, including its application to different shapes and calculation of volume. Many struggled to understand the use of SSE, SST, and r-squared values in data analysis, with some requesting more detailed explanations. Additionally, there was confusion about finding trendlines, understanding the difference between r and r-squared values, and interpreting the results of regression analysis. These areas of confusion highlight the need for further clarification and support in these specific aspects of regression."
149,"SUMMARY: Many students found Assignments 10 and 11 to be confusing, particularly with regards to the laminar approach and its application. Some students struggled to understand how to use the laminar approach for multiple shapes, while others were unclear about the required values and equations. The instructions for Assignment 10, specifically Part 5, were also found to be confusing, with some students unsure about how to calculate the volume of the reservoir and others struggling with the regression lines. Additionally, some students were unclear about the difference between SST and SSE, and how to use these values to analyze data. A few students also mentioned that the assignment instructions were not informative enough, leading to a ""grey area"" in their understanding of the tasks.",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the ideas of unclear exam instructions and expectations into one sentence, as these are closely related concepts. For example, ""Many students found the exam instructions and expectations unclear, with some desiring more detail on what to expect on the exam.""

2. To focus the summary more on the topic of Exam Prep, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, while some students felt that the exam prep was clear,"" as it introduces a contrasting idea that is not the main focus of the summary. Instead, focus on summarizing the concerns and questions students had about exam prep.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about what students were unclear about in terms of exam prep, such as the mention of previous exams or the use of Excel. For example, ""Some students also expressed a desire for access to previous exams to study from, and clarification on the use of Excel for exam prep.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the exam instructions and expectations unclear, with some desiring more detail on what to expect on the exam. Specifically, some students expressed a desire for access to previous exams to study from, similar to other classes, and clarification on the use of Excel for exam prep. Additionally, students were unclear about how to prepare for the exam, with some suggesting that more information on how to study and what to expect would be helpful."

I did not know exactly how to calculate the pressure head because I the slide went by too quickly
Preparing for the exam 
Nothing was confusing about today's class or needed more explanation 
I really enjoyed today's class!!
I was confused by what the student answer sheet meant when it said that the memo gave us data of the volume of the reservoir as a function of time, and I saw no function
There was no in class activity so that was confusing because no one mentioned it. The exam instructions were also a bit confusing.
the flow rate chart was confusing 
 The instructions for what was going to be on the exam were a little bit confusing, I wish there would have been more detail.
 Nothing was confusing today
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused as to why we had so much time in studio time with very little explanation as to what the time was meant for. Also, I did not see how the slides connected with the project. When the teacher explained the pressure head, I was a little confused by what factors go into this. Is it just a height ? 
 I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir.
 I think the class was well explained today.

 How to completely calculate the power
 nothing.
 The quiz modules did not show up at 3.
 It would have been nice to see the class slides on brightspace during lecture.
 Basically everything made sense today, i never really had any questions but the ones i did were answered when we went into breakout rooms. It would have been nice if we could have done some review on the quiz

 Nothing was confusing. We just sat in breakout rooms working on the projects.
 I didn't find anything confusing in class today.
 I thought how we calculate volumetric flow rate was a little bit confusing.
 How the excel will work for the in class quiz
 Everything seemed straight forward to me. If something seems unclear I will look at the slides or ask questions. 
 We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
 I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
 I didn't have any confusion in class today.
 After showing the slide on assignment 10, I know I did the models wrong but it wasn't explained how to do it correctly.
 I was confused as to whether there was an in-class participation assignment

 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.
Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confusedif we need responses from people or if we should generate themourselves.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the ambiguity surrounding the deliverables for Assignment 16 was a common point of confusion among students"" as it is implied in the previous sentences and does not add new information.

2. To improve focus on the topic Deliverables, rephrase the sentence ""Some students were unsure about what parts of the document to focus on, while others were confused about the scope of the project and what was expected of them"" to specifically mention what deliverables were unclear, such as ""Some students were unsure about which parts of Assignment 16 to complete, or what specific tasks were required for the project"".

3. To further clarify the summary, consider breaking up the long sentence ""Additionally, students were unclear about how to gather information from stakeholders, whether they should email them or generate their own responses"" into a separate sentence or rephrasing it to directly relate to the deliverables, such as ""Students were also uncertain about what was expected in terms of stakeholder input for the deliverables"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the deliverables for Assignment 16, citing inconsistent or unclear instructions across different documents on Brightspace.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.

 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score

2. To improve focus on the topic of Calculations, consider removing or rephrasing sentences that mention broader topics, such as the pace of the class or the need for more explanation and examples, and instead focus on the specific calculation-related issues that students faced.

3. To make the summary more specific and detailed, consider adding more specific examples or quotes from the reflections to illustrate the types of calculation-related challenges that students encountered, such as the difficulty in applying formulas or determining which variables to use.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the calculations for specific equations and formulas, such as the pressure head, power equation, and laminar approach, to be confusing. They struggled to apply formulas, determine which variables to use, and understand how to create mathematical models, particularly for the Taum Sauk project. For example, some students were unsure about how to calculate volumes and flow rates, while others found it challenging to derive mathematical equations from tables and create graphs for the laminar approach. These calculation-related challenges were a common theme throughout the reflections, highlighting the need for further clarification and support in this area."

To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the students' requests for more explanation and examples of the laminar approach, and their need for more guidance on using Excel to create mathematical models. This could be condensed into a single point, such as ""Students expressed a need for more explanation, examples, and guidance on applying the laminar approach, particularly in using Excel to create mathematical models.""

2. To focus the summary more on the topic of Laminar Approach, consider removing the point about simplifying diagrams and labeling them correctly, as this seems to be a more general point about the assignment rather than specifically about the laminar approach.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about what specifically was unclear or confusing about the laminar approach, such as the calculations involved or the application of the approach to the assignment. This could help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' confusion and identify areas where the instructor could provide more support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the laminar approach, specifically in creating mathematical models and calculating volume. They requested more explanation, examples, and guidance on applying the laminar approach, particularly in using Excel to create mathematical models. Some students mentioned that the instructions for using the laminar approach were unclear, and they were unsure about how to apply it to the assignment. Specifically, students struggled with understanding the calculations involved in the laminar approach and how to use the approach to derive mathematical equations from the tables. Overall, the laminar approach was a major point of confusion for many students, and they would have liked more clarification and support in understanding and applying this concept."
171,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on prototyping to be clear and straightforward, with some expressing appreciation for the detailed explanations. However, several students reported confusion on specific aspects of prototyping, including how to create prototypes for abstract ideas or systems rather than physical products, how to collect data for prototypes, and how to test online prototypes. Some students also struggled with the logistics of creating prototypes, such as accessing necessary materials or using specific software like CAD or 3D design programs. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the scope of prototyping, including whether to create multiple prototypes for different solutions or multiple prototypes for the same solution.",Prototyping/Creating Prototypes,"Nothing was confusing

 Everything is pretty clear!
 I was a little confused on how we are supposed to make a prototype with everything going on but it was talked about in great detail to help me understand.
 I would have liked to go over how to use 3D design programs and which ones are best.
 the consistency between the powerpoints and the doc is bad sometimes

 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.

 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.

It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","Suggestions:
1. To improve the summary, it would be beneficial to specify the number of students who expressed confusion about the gasoline density, as it would provide a clearer understanding of the extent of the issue. For example, ""Several students (approximately [number]) questioned the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity...""

2. The summary could be more concise by removing the phrase ""with several students wondering if it was intended to be a trick."" This phrase, although present in the reflections, is not crucial to understanding the main point of confusion and makes the summary slightly longer.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Gasoline Density, it could be rephrased to directly state the students' concerns, such as: ""Students were confused about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity, specifically why it was provided but not utilized in the calculations, leading to questions about its relevance and purpose.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Approximately 5 students expressed confusion about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity, specifically why it was provided but not utilized in the calculations, leading to questions about its relevance and purpose. This confusion arose as the density of gasoline was given but not used in the calculations, causing students to wonder why it was included in the first place."

The many failures that the designers and operators allowed to happen compounding in the overall failure of Taum Sauk.
I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
I found the reasons for dam failure to be quite captivating. That was a cool part of class to investigate those failures.
The destruction of Taum Sauk was very interesting because understanding adisaster is always very intriguing and interesting to look at.
finding the various reasons behind the reservoir failure was enjoyable
The failures of the Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting and the fact that cutting corners backfired
Taum sauk failure","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Students appreciated"" and instead directly state the points that students found interesting. This would make the summary more focused on the topic and avoid unnecessary words.

2. To improve the focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, consider removing the general statement about ""engineering projects"" at the end of the summary. Instead, rephrase the conclusion to specifically highlight the key takeaways from the Taum Sauk Reservoir example, such as the importance of proper ethics, communication, and oversight in preventing similar failures.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points. For example, the phrases ""negligence, lack of proper ethics, and oversights in design and communication"" and ""issues with oversight and basic land surveying"" both relate to the reservoir's flaws. Combining these points could make the summary more streamlined and easier to read.","REFINED SUMMARY: The discussion on the Taum Sauk Reservoir was a highlight of the class, with many students finding it insightful and interesting to learn about the engineering failures that led to its catastrophic consequences. The reservoir's flaws, including negligence, lack of proper ethics, and oversights in design, communication, and basic land surveying, were particularly noteworthy. Students found it interesting to analyze the various reasons behind the reservoir's failure, including the decision to cut corners and the refusal to spend more money to add necessary safety measures. The Taum Sauk Reservoir example effectively illustrated the importance of proper ethics, communication, and oversight in preventing similar failures, highlighting the devastating consequences of prioritizing cost-cutting over safety and responsible engineering practices."
179,"SUMMARY: Many students found the instructions for Assignment 10 to be unclear, particularly with regards to the technical brief and the mathematical modeling required for the project. Several students expressed confusion about the ""laminar approach"" and how to apply it in the assignment. Additionally, some students were unsure about what was expected in terms of sources for the in-class activity, with questions about what constitutes a reliable source and how to properly cite it.

I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students seemed to need more clarification and explanation on the specifics of the assignment and the reservoir itself"" as it is a general statement that doesn't add new information. Instead, focus on summarizing the specific points of confusion related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""Several students mentioned that the instructions for the assignment were unclear, specifically with regards to the mathematical modeling and the laminar approach"" to ""Students were confused about the mathematical modeling and laminar approach in the context of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, specifically in relation to calculating the reservoir's volume and creating visual models.""

3.

Students were confused about the mathematical modeling and laminar approach in the context of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, specifically in relation to calculating the reservoir's volume and creating visual models. Some students were unsure about the direction of the dam's walls (inward or outward) and the expectations for the scholarly summary.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing

Some students felt that the instructions for these assignments were unclear, and they needed more explanation on what was expected of them. Specific areas of confusion included how to handle missing data in Excel for Assignment 8, the objective of the skittles activity, and the organization of assignments in Brightspace. Additionally, some students felt that the lectures did not provide enough detail on the assignments, leading to difficulties when working on them independently or in teams.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail sincethe module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for eachassignment, such as a read through of the instructions and theexpectation for each point.
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in classassignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment.But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number ofdata points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go throughthem and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for itto be clear.
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for mebecause we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it whatdata we are using
I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there weremore examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excelmore.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion regarding Assignment 5 and Assignment 8, into a single statement. For example, ""Many students expressed confusion regarding the details of Assignments 5 and 8, including unclear instructions, handling missing data in Excel, and the objective of the skittles activity.""

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, remove the phrase ""leading to difficulties when working on them independently or in teams"" as it is not directly related to the details of the assignments. Instead, focus on the specific areas of confusion mentioned by the students.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally, some students felt that the lectures did not provide enough detail on the assignments"" and instead, incorporate this point into the main statement. For example, ""Many students expressed confusion regarding the details of Assignments 5 and 8, including unclear instructions, handling missing data in Excel, and the objective of the skittles activity, which they felt were not adequately covered in the lectures.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the details of Assignments 5 and 8, including unclear instructions, handling missing data in Excel, the objective of the skittles activity, and the organization of assignments in Brightspace. They felt that these aspects were not adequately covered in the lectures, leading to a lack of understanding of what was expected of them in these assignments."
197,"SUMMARY: In the lecture on Statistics and Probability, students found several concepts confusing, particularly the z-score and its relationship to probability and standard distribution of data. Many students requested more practice and explanation on how to calculate and apply z-scores, as well as how to handle missing data in Excel. The concept of probability, especially in relation to histograms and bell curves, also caused confusion. Additionally, some students struggled with understanding the normal distribution, standard deviation, and how to determine the similarity of distributions to the normal distribution. The adjustment of histogram x-axis values from numerical to percentage was another point of confusion. Overall, students felt that more detailed explanations, examples, and practice exercises would help clarify these concepts.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from

 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.

 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Suggestions: 

1. To improve the summary, it would be more concise to combine the points about the x-axis adjustment and data manipulation into one sentence, as they are related to the same issue. For example: ""Several students found the Skittles example confusing, particularly when it came to adjusting the x-axis values from numerical to percentage, with some unsure if there was a straightforward way to make this change or if it required manual calculation and data manipulation.""

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, it would be better to remove the sentence about the objective of the Skittles activity being unclear. While this is related to the Skittles example, it is more of a general issue with the activity rather than a specific issue with the example itself. Instead, the summary could focus on the specific issues with the example, such as the x-axis adjustment and data manipulation.

3. To make the summary more concise, the sentence about the data from the Skittles example and its relation to Assignment 08 could be rephrased to focus on the specific issue. For example: ""Some students were unclear about how the Skittles data related to Assignment 08, specifically how it differed from the provided PDF.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students found the Skittles example confusing, particularly when it came to adjusting the x-axis values from numerical to percentage, with some unsure if there was a straightforward way to make this change or if it required manual calculation and data manipulation.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Despite these initial issues"" as it doesn't add significant information to the summary. The summary can directly state that most students were able to move forward with the assignment without major difficulties.

2. To improve focus on Assignment 10, the summary could avoid mentioning ""most students were able to move forward with the assignment without major difficulties"" as it's somewhat vague and doesn't specifically relate to Assignment 10. Instead, it could focus on the specific issues related to Assignment 10, such as submission process and initial confusion.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas into one sentence. For example, instead of stating ""Some groups also encountered issues with their submissions not working at first, but these issues were resolved"" and ""details regarding Assignment 10 were not immediately clear, but were later resolved"", the summary could say ""Several students experienced initial confusion with Assignment 10, including issues with submission on Brightspace and unclear details, which were eventually clarified.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Several students experienced initial confusion with Assignment 10, including issues with submission on Brightspace and unclear details, which were eventually clarified.

There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the multiple mentions of confusion around Assignment 16, into a single statement. For example, ""Many students found the project details and expectations, particularly for Assignment 16, to be unclear or confusing.""

2. To maintain focus on the topic of Projects, consider removing the mention of the workload and time constraints, as this is more related to the course logistics rather than the project itself. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of the project that caused confusion, such as the scope, requirements, and process.

3. To improve clarity, consider adding more specific examples or details from the student reflections to support the summary points. For example, instead of stating that students were ""unsure about how to identify and address stakeholders,"" specify that they were confused about the difference between stakeholders and clients/end-users, as mentioned in the reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the project details and expectations, particularly for Assignment 16, to be unclear or confusing, with some struggling to understand the scope and requirements. Specifically, students were confused about the difference between criteria and constraints, and how to empathize with users, especially for online students who may not have direct access to campus users.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.

Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.

 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

Several students found the inclusion of the density of gasoline in the in-class activity to be confusing and irrelevant to their calculations. Others struggled to understand how to determine the environmental impact of solar panels for Assignment 13. However, some students noted that their confusion was resolved after further explanation or discussion, such as the carbon emissions calculation being clarified through an example. Additionally, a few students expressed confusion about the difference between assumptions and unreliable data in the context of calculations and analysis. Overall, students required more detailed explanations and examples to fully understand these complex calculations."
225,"SUMMARY: Several students expressed confusion regarding the inclusion of gas density in the in-class activity, with some assuming it was irrelevant or intended to be misleading. A few students specifically mentioned the density of gasoline, questioning its relevance to the calculations and wondering why it was included on the slide. Some students also mentioned that the use of gas density in the activity was unclear, and they were unsure how it related to the environmental analysis.",Gas Density,"in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart. 
 I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
 Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
 I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment. 
 There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
 I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth. 
 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught
 The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
 Nothing, everything was clear.

1. To improve the summary, it could be more concise by removing the phrase ""with some assuming it was irrelevant or intended to be misleading"" and instead focus on the main point that students were confused about the inclusion of gas density in the in-class activity.

2. The summary could be more focused on the topic of Gas Density by removing the phrase ""and wondering why it was included on the slide"" which is more related to the presentation style rather than the concept of gas density itself.

3. To make the summary more specific, it could mention the exact number of students who expressed confusion about gas density, instead of using general phrases like ""Several students"" and ""A few students"". This would provide a clearer picture of the extent of the confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: A total of 5 students expressed confusion regarding the inclusion of gas density in the in-class activity, specifically mentioning the density of gasoline. They questioned its relevance to the calculations and were unsure how it related to the environmental analysis. This suggests that the concept of gas density and its application in the activity was not clearly understood by some students, and may require further clarification or explanation in future lectures."
226,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of prototyping to be engaging and exciting, with many appreciating the hands-on experience and creative freedom it offers.

 I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap. 
 I'm enjoying this project as a whole and I'm looking forward to building and testing our prototypes. 
 What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative.
 The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
 It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
 I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. 
 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. 
 I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model 
 That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
 We didn't do much just got some work done. 
 Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. 
 I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. 
 expanding my knowledge on prototypes
 designing our prototypes
 We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
 It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
 I found working with my team interesting.
 Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
 I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out 
 I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone. 
 Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype
 The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.
 Everything :)

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when it came to brainstorming and generating ideas for prototypes"" as it is already implied in the context of group work. This would make the first sentence more direct and focused on the group work aspect.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Groupwork, consider removing the mention of ""the instructor, Jeff"" as it is not directly related to the group work aspect. Instead, focus on the interactions and benefits that students experienced within their groups.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider combining the last two sentences into one, for example: ""The breakout rooms allowed students to work effectively with their group, make progress on their project, and was a highlight for many students."" This would eliminate the need for the sentence ""Overall, the collaborative nature of the class was a key aspect that many students enjoyed and found beneficial.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the group work aspect of the class to be the most interesting and helpful part of the lecture. Working with their peers allowed them to flow with ideas and get somewhere with their project. Students appreciated the opportunity to clarify questions and get feedback from their team.

I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
 I enjoyed the class it really is starting to seem like we are learning stuff that is going to be very important to us. I was also very excited to learn that A16 was not part 4 like we thought
 Learning about different types of problem solving
 I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
 I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
 I thought the beetle video was interesting because it was happening at Purdue and the way nature adapted was cool.
 Using Google to find patents and how it is all public information. 
 I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
 Even though the use of biomimicry was a little confusing, I did find how it was used in the video to be incredibly interesting!
 I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class. 
 The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering. 
 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before.

 starting a new project was the most interesting today
 It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
 The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem. 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. 
 I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.

SUMMARY: Students' reflections on DLBs reveal confusion about the implementation, particularly the use of linked lists and their connection to nodes and levels. Questions also arose about the relationship between DLBs and Multi-way RSTs, as well as the concept of nodelets and their relation to nodes in linked lists. Some students struggled to understand runtime analyses and variables used in them.

Suggestions:

1. To improve clarity, consider specifying what aspects of the implementation are confusing, such as the connection between linked lists and nodes, to provide a more focused summary.

Confusion arose when applying these methods to linearize data, with some students questioning the need for further rearrangement in the Eadie-Hofstee method and others struggling to manipulate data to calculate initial velocity using these methods. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the next steps after M2 and how to write pseudo code for user-defined functions. These areas of confusion highlight the need for further clarification and practice in applying linearization techniques to specific models."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the video on enzymes sparked curiosity and interest among the students, and many are looking forward to applying this knowledge to their project."" as it is somewhat repetitive and doesn't add new information. Instead, focus on summarizing the specific aspects of the video that students found interesting.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence ""Students also found the concepts introduced in the video, including the equation for finding velocity through maximum velocity and the importance of Vmax and Km, to be interesting and useful for the project."" to specifically highlight what aspects of the video were interesting, such as ""Students found the visual representation of enzyme kinetics, including the equation for finding velocity through maximum velocity and the significance of Vmax and Km, to be engaging.""

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, instead of having two separate sentences about the visual representation of enzymes and the comparison of different solutions, combine them into one sentence, such as ""Students found the visual representation of enzymes, including the disappearance of stains and the comparison of different solutions, to be particularly engaging and interesting.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the video on enzymes to be a highlight of the lecture, with several noting that it was interesting to see enzymes in action and learn about how they work.

For example, instead of simply stating that students struggled with the concept of simple harmonic oscillation, mention that they had trouble understanding how inductors produce oscillations and how this relates to the spring analogy mentioned in one of the reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion with various aspects of inductors, particularly in understanding the direction of current through Lenz's law and the behavior of inductors in circuits. Many struggled with visualizing and interpreting graphs of voltage vs time, specifically how inductance influences amplitude and wavelength. The application of equations for finding current in RL circuits was also a source of confusion, with difficulties in determining when to use which equation and how to calculate current and potential energy when a switch is turned on or off. Additionally, students found it challenging to understand how inductors produce oscillations, with some finding the spring analogy helpful in clarifying this concept. Overall, the reflections highlight a need for further clarification on the fundamental principles and behaviors of inductors in circuits."
