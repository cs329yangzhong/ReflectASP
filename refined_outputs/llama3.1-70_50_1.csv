Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ",32,"I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could’ve been more in-depth.
I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense.
I really didn’t understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively.

1. To improve the summary, consider rephrasing it to focus more specifically on TopHat/in-class questions. For example, instead of mentioning ""complex diagrams"" in general, mention that students found specific TopHat questions involving diagrams (e.g., the charges arranged in a square) challenging.

2. Emphasize the common thread of students feeling rushed to complete TopHat questions, as this is a recurring theme in the reflections. This could be done by rephrasing the sentence to highlight the time constraint issue more explicitly.

3. Remove the mention of the Shell Theorem and grounding from the summary, as these concepts are not directly related to TopHat/in-class questions. Instead, focus on the specific challenges students faced with the questions themselves, such as deriving r values and applying forces.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found specific TopHat questions, such as the one involving charges arranged in a square and deriving r values, challenging due to time constraints and complex calculations.

What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.

Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem.

Many appreciated the ability to rearrange and substitute equations to solve for variables, and enjoyed the challenge of choosing the right equation to fit the situation.",Problem Solving or Picking Equations,"Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same.
I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school.

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
 The monkey experiment is interesting.
 The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
 The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
 The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
 Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
 The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool. 
 I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
 I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
 Calculating 2-D motion
 I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
 The group questions
 The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch. 
 I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
 The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
 The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
 understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
 Monkey problem.
 falling monkey
 I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems. 
 Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
 The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole 
 The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating. 
 I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
 projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant 
 The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent. 
 The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
 I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other. 
 projectile motion and falling monkey
 I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about. 
 The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
 The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
 The FBD drawings 
 I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.

 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

the two tensions instead of one
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
How you could put more than one object in a system 
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
 I was confused about the free body diagrams. 
 The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
 The part that was confusing about today's lecture was the problem with the three blocks. I didn't know how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram for that.
 Some of the free body diagrams, such as the one with the ice blocks, still are not clear to me
 pulleys
 I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times.  This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
 doubling the force of tension 
 I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from. 
 I'm a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable 
 Double tension on a pulley and the principles behind it occurring

 The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing
 How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
 Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing.

 Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
 I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
 Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair
 the source of the two tension vectors in the free body 
 No it was very well explained the free body diagrams 
 The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
 The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
 The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
 I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got.

 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .

In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually.

the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos.

I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.

 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas.

 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. To improve the summary's focus on the topic of Angles, consider removing the phrase ""and how it relates to the angle"" from the last sentence, as it slightly deviates from the topic of angles and introduces the concept of resultant vectors. The revised sentence could be: ""Additionally, there was confusion about identifying the direction of a resultant vector.""

2. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two sentences that mention angle conversions into one sentence. For example: ""Some struggled with angle conversions, including when to add or subtract 360° and when to add 180° to an answer.""

3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the context in which students struggled with angles. For example, instead of saying ""when to use sine versus cosine"", specify that it was in the context of vector math and provide more details about the specific scenarios where students were confused.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding angles in vector math, particularly when to use sine versus cosine in different scenarios.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B.

 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.

 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when one block is on top of another"" and instead focus on the general concept of friction on multiple blocks or surfaces.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of friction, consider adding more specific details about the types of friction that students struggled with, such as static friction, kinetic friction, or the difference between fs and fsmax. This will help to provide a clearer picture of the specific challenges students faced.

3. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider breaking it down into two sentences: one that summarizes the general challenges students faced with friction, and another that highlights specific areas of difficulty, such as combining free body diagrams or understanding the role of friction in multi-block systems.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of friction on multiple blocks or surfaces to be challenging, particularly in determining the forces involved and understanding the role of friction in these systems.

 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams

 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as ""distinguishing between criteria and metrics"" and ""how metrics were different than criteria"" into a single point about the general confusion between criteria and metrics.

2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""how to determine specific numbers for metrics"" as it is more related to metrics than criteria, and rephrase the summary to focus on the confusion around what to include in the criteria section and how to describe scores for the criteria.

3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more specific, such as ""Students struggled to understand what constitutes criteria in the weighted decision matrix, with some finding it difficult to distinguish from metrics, and others unsure about what to include in the criteria section or how to describe scores for the criteria.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand what constitutes criteria in the weighted decision matrix, with some finding it difficult to distinguish from metrics, and others unsure about what to include in the criteria section or how to describe scores for the criteria."

when assignment 18 was supposed to be due
Nothing
Constraints versus metrics
it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
 N/A
 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing.

I thought that the data collected in excel was interesting. I found that it was cool that the company was able to track and see how long each individual rider rode the bike.
I didn't think much was interesting, but I would have liked to hear more about the Problem Statement.
I had never heard of problem statements so that was interesting to learn.
Getting to roughly examine the file and analyze their data
I found the design and scoping cycle/process to be the most interesting because it will be an integral part of this class and in a future career.
I found learning about how to write a problem statement the most important and most interesting today.  I also found learning about excel to be interesting.
I found it really interesting how much data was collected from the bikes, and how much information you can track down from one excel file.
I was interested in how much data was collected by bike share. It seemed like they had a lot of information.
Proble scoping
 I really liked how we were able to use excel and import data from online into an excel sheet and therefore analyze the data and make statements based on what we saw. 
 I find the bike share project very interesting. 
 The bike data
 Looking through the CoGo data on Excel and analyzing trends was very interesting.
 The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
 The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
 the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
 I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
 I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
 The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
 Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups 
 I liked doing the complex calculations in excel 
 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email. 
 How to use excel 
 How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.
 I enjoyed meeting new people in my breakout rooms and seeing what they drew for the in class activity.",118,"The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""allowing them to exchange ideas and collaborate with peers"" as it is somewhat implied by ""breakout rooms and group discussions"". This would result in a more direct and focused statement.

2. To further focus on the topic ""Talking and Exchanging Information"", consider adding more specific details about the types of conversations or interactions that took place in the breakout rooms, such as ""problem-solving conversations"" or ""resolving technical issues"" to give a clearer picture of what students gained from these interactions.

3. To make the summary more representative of the reflections, consider adding a phrase that highlights the value students placed on hearing others' opinions and perspectives, such as ""valuing the opportunity to hear and consider others' thoughts and opinions"". This would capture the essence of students' appreciation for the interactive and collaborative nature of the class.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students valued the breakout rooms and group discussions, engaging in problem-solving conversations and resolving technical issues.

I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.

 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.

 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?

Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

To focus more on Assignment 12, rephrase the summary to avoid mentioning ""real engineering practices"" and instead emphasize the specific aspects of Assignment 12 that students found interesting, such as ""calculating power and volumetric flow rates"" and ""using Excel to analyze data and create graphs"".

3. To make the summary more specific to Assignment 12, consider adding a detail that is unique to the assignment, such as ""students enjoyed working on the reservoir power equation"" or ""students found the instant volumetric flowrate calculations to be most interesting"", to give a clearer idea of what specifically about Assignment 12 students found fascinating.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Assignment 12 fascinating, particularly the reservoir power equation and instant volumetric flowrate calculations, and enjoyed working on it in breakout rooms with their teams, using Excel to analyze data and create graphs to calculate power and volumetric flow rates."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""including confusion over the number of idea generation techniques required, the need for a prototype, and the iteration process"" and instead focus on the general sentiment that A17 deliverables and instructions were unclear.

2. To improve focus on the topic, rephrase the sentence to directly state that students found the instructions unclear, rather than stating that they ""found the deliverables and instructions... to be unclear"". This will help to emphasize the main point of the summary.

3.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Students generally found the lecture on regression to be clear"" and instead focus on the specific areas of confusion, as this is the main point of the summary.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Regression, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Additionally, some students found the assignments, particularly A10, to be unclear"" to ""Some students struggled to apply regression concepts to assignments, particularly A10, due to unclear requirements.""

3. To improve clarity, consider breaking up the list of confusing concepts into separate sentences or phrases, rather than listing them in a single sentence. For example, ""Some students expressed confusion over the laminar approach, while others struggled to understand the difference between r-squared and r values, and calculating regression constants.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion over specific regression concepts, including the laminar approach and calculating regression constants.

 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.
 Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me",218,"I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms
Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.
I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class.
Learning about histograms
Creating histograms from the data given to me.
I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus.
I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational
Using histograms to find probabilities
I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normaldeviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
I think it’s a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set
Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when applied to the skittles project"" and instead, directly mention that students found the skittles project to be an engaging way to learn about histograms.

2. To focus more on the topic of histograms, consider adding a specific detail from the reflections, such as how histograms can be used to ""standardize data"" or ""turn any histogram into a normal deviation"" to calculate probabilities.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of histograms, consider removing the phrase ""calculate probabilities"" and instead, emphasize how histograms can be used to ""show data numbers"" or provide ""informational"" insights, as mentioned in the reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found histograms to be an engaging topic, with the skittles project making the concept more relatable and interactive. They enjoyed learning how to create histograms from data and appreciated how histograms can be used to show data numbers, provide informational insights, and standardize data to gain a deeper understanding of the subject."

They appreciated the opportunity to share ideas, get to know one another, and receive feedback in a smaller group setting, which they believed would facilitate easier collaboration and communication throughout the course.",Breakout Rooms,"I found the class to be interesting and interactive. I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.

 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly the use of breakout rooms"" and instead, integrate it into the main sentence to make it more direct. For example: ""Students found the class logistics, including the use of breakout rooms, to be interesting...""

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic Class Logistics, consider removing the phrase ""and the overview of the course structure and expectations"" as it is more related to the course content rather than logistics. 

3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the last two points into one sentence. For example: ""They appreciated learning about the grade breakdown and the support systems in place, including the CATME system for group placement and the availability of multiple advisors with different skill sets.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the class logistics, including the use of breakout rooms, to be interesting, as it allowed them to meet and interact with their peers.

I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points of confusion, such as ""understanding which variables to use"" and ""how to approach mathematical models"", into a single point, e.g., ""understanding assignment requirements, including variable selection and mathematical modeling approaches"".
2. To improve focus on the topic, remove the phrase ""particularly for assignments 5A, 5B, and 10"" as it is not essential to the summary, and instead, focus on the general issues with assignment explanations and descriptions.
3. To make the summary more specific, consider adding more details about the types of unclear instructions, such as ""diagram submission requirements"" or ""laminar approach instructions"", to provide a clearer picture of the areas that need improvement.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found assignment explanations and descriptions unclear, leading to confusion about understanding assignment requirements, including variable selection and mathematical modeling approaches.

 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.

3. To make the summary more reflective of the students' reflections, consider incorporating more direct quotes or paraphrases from the original responses. For example, you could mention that students found it interesting that ""such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures"" or that the reservoir's failure was a result of ""cutting corners"" and ""negligence.""

The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two related points about students' struggles with citing sources and searching for general information using scholarly sources. This could be rephrased as: ""Students experienced difficulties with citing sources, including determining the type of source and proper APA citation, as well as searching for general information using scholarly sources, which they found too specific.""

2. To focus the summary more on the topic of Scholarly Work/Citations, consider removing the phrase ""which sources were acceptable"" and instead emphasize the specific challenges students faced with citations, such as ""Students were unclear about the level of reliability required for class assignments and struggled to apply APA citation guidelines.""

3. To make the summary more precise, consider adding specific examples or quotes from the reflections to illustrate the points being made. For example, ""Some students found it challenging to determine whether an article was a journal, website, or excerpt, and how to cite it properly in APA format, as one student noted 'I was confused to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc.'""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students experienced difficulties with citing sources, including determining the type of source and proper APA citation, as well as searching for general information using scholarly sources, which they found too specific.

 I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting. 
 What I found most interesting about today's class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses. 
 That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
 I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
 The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.

 The different types of energy usage 
 I thought our time in breakout rooms working on the assignment was the most interesting. The time in class is greatly appreciated.
 Today's most Interesting thing was learning more about how the different types of energy are use, how much they cost and how it all works.
 I was interested in the example used for the in-class activity because it somewhat pertained to a job that I had previously worked.
 I found it really interesting that companies are able to take into consideration the amount they're saving per unit in order to determine the payback time 
 Something interesting was the in-class activity, it was fun being able to learn how to solve for a payback period because it is cool to apply it to a real life example.

To improve the focus on solar panels and solar energy, consider rephrasing the second sentence to specifically mention the aspects of solar energy that students found interesting, such as its cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and environmental impact. This would make the summary more detailed and relevant to the topic.

3. To make the summary more coherent, consider combining the last two sentences into one, highlighting how the assignment on designing a solar panel system for the Indianapolis Library allowed students to apply their knowledge of solar energy in a real-world context, balancing economic and environmental considerations. This would create a smoother flow of ideas and emphasize the practical application of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the topic of solar panels and solar energy engaging, with many expressing interest in learning about the production of energy from solar panels.

Some students also found the instructions for Assignment 5 to be confusing, and a few were unsure about the objective of the in-class skittles activity. Additionally, some students felt that the assignments were not thoroughly explained in class, leading to confusion when working on them independently or in groups.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.

The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail sincethe module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for eachassignment, such as a read through of the instructions and theexpectation for each point.

I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in classassignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment.But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion around Assignment 8 and the need for more explanation on z-scores, into a single statement. This would help to eliminate repetition and make the summary more focused.

2. To improve the focus on the topic ""Details Regarding Assignments"", consider removing the mention of the in-class skittles activity, as it seems to be more related to the lecture content rather than the assignment details. Instead, focus on the specific assignment-related issues that students mentioned, such as unclear expectations, missing data, and confusing instructions.

3. To make the summary more specific, consider including more details about the specific assignments that students found confusing, such as Assignment 5 and Assignment 8. This would help to provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need more clarification and support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the details regarding assignments unclear, particularly with Assignments 5 and 8.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.

 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, it could be rephrased to focus more specifically on the Skittles example, rather than mentioning the activity and submission in general. For example, ""Students found the Skittles example to be somewhat unclear, particularly with regards to switching the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value, and how to adjust the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. Additionally, some students were unsure about the objective of the Skittles example itself.""

2. The summary could be condensed to remove repetitive language, such as ""somewhat unclear"" and ""confusion about."" This would make the summary more concise and direct. For example, ""Students struggled with the Skittles example, specifically with switching the x-axis to a percentage and adjusting histogram values. Some were also unsure about the objective of the example.""

3. To make the summary more specific and focused on the topic, it could include more details about the specific aspects of the Skittles example that caused confusion. For example, ""Students had trouble understanding how to convert the numerical values on the x-axis to percentages in the Skittles example, and how to apply this to the histogram. Additionally, some students were unclear about the purpose of the example and how it related to the assignment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the Skittles example, specifically with converting numerical x-axis values to percentages and adjusting histogram values. Some were also unsure about the objective of the example and its relation to the assignment, highlighting a need for clearer explanations and more detailed guidance."

 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information

 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.

 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.

 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.

One thing that was confusing about today's class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic?
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.

This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.
 everything was pretty clear
 I didn't find anything that was too confusing in today's class.
 The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.

 One thing that was confusing about today's class was are the exploring prior art supposed to be just general things being done or are they supposed to relate specifically to our ideas that we generated?

I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
Something confusing in today’s class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work.
I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.
The end goal of the assignment and how much we are expected to do for it
It was really confusing to follow what is expected from Assignment 17, I still don’t fully understand what is expected of us.","Suggestions: 

1. To improve the summary, consider specifying the exact aspects of Assignment 17 that were unclear, such as the sections required, the extent of the in-class assignment, and the depth of the pros and cons diagram. This would provide a more detailed understanding of the areas where students struggled.

2. The summary could also benefit from highlighting the common themes among the students' reflections, such as the confusion surrounding the iteration section and the exploring prior art component. This would help to identify patterns in the students' understanding of the assignment.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""somewhat confusing"" and instead focus on the specific areas where students experienced difficulties. This would help to streamline the summary and make it more focused on the key points.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with Assignment 17, citing unclear expectations on required sections, the extent of the in-class assignment, and the depth of the pros and cons diagram. Common areas of confusion included the iteration section, exploring prior art component, and specific requirements such as the number of idea generation methods needed."
233,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear, but some struggled with the in-class activity on pros and cons, particularly those unfamiliar with the coffee makers (Keurig and French Press) used as examples. Some found the instructions unclear, and a few had trouble understanding the expected depth of analysis for the pros and cons diagram.",Pros and cons/in class activity,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.

 I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
 I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
 The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
 Something interesting in today's class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it. 
 The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
 I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
 The design problem was quite interesting.

 writing the problem statement
 It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
 I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don't repeat them. 
 I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.

When to use strong induction over weak induction","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""despite knowing that strong induction is not more powerful than weak induction"" as it's not directly related to the challenges students faced with strong induction. This would help maintain focus on the topic.

2. To improve clarity, rephrase ""choosing the correct base case"" to ""selecting the appropriate base case(s)"" to better reflect the students' concerns about determining the number of base cases required.

3. Consider combining the two related points about base cases into a single point, such as ""Students struggled with determining the number and selection of base cases in strong induction."" This would help streamline the summary and emphasize the key challenges.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found strong induction challenging, particularly in determining the number and selection of base cases.

Binomial coefficients. Seems very interesting to use
the concept of permutations and combinations is interesting, just difficult to fully understand

Being able to ask stupid questions in class and after class and having the professor take them seriously 
The number of ways you can choose a certain number of things is the same as the number of ways you can choose everything but those things.
I really like how Pascals Identity can be used to express binomial coefficients through recursive additions instead of factorials. its pretty clever.

The oscilloscope greatly increased my understanding of a circuit at resonance.
 I really liked the demonstration that showed that resonance is a higher amplitude
 how Z and R are related

 The idea of a current lagging or leading the emf is interesting because you can learn about the other aspects from it. 
 That current leads if there is a negative phase angle. 
 I found the problem solving interesting. It was interesting working out problems and solving.
 demonstrations 
 I liked going over the practice problems we did in class because they were quite helpful for solving the homework. 
 The demo with the sin waves
 The oscillations were pretty interesting
 having the visual representation of the phasors made it easier to do some of the questions
 I thought it was interesting to see how z = R at resonance.
 I enjoyed the changing oscillating ammeter. 
 visual of waves
 I loved the part in class where we were discussing the conceptual based questions
 The demonstration of the graphs
 Difference between wd and w
 Knowing the differences between the three with graphs and equations
 At resonance,  X_L=X_C
 Phasers are fun
 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""especially the use of oscilloscopes and projected meters"" and instead focus on the general effectiveness of visual aids in understanding circuit concepts. This would result in a summary that still conveys the importance of in-class demonstrations without providing too much detail.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence to explicitly mention ""in-class demonstrations"" and their role in visualizing circuit concepts. For example, ""Students found in-class demonstrations, such as those using oscilloscopes and projected meters, to be particularly helpful in visualizing resonance in circuits and understanding circuit concepts.""

3. To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""making complex concepts more accessible"" and instead focus on the specific concepts that were aided by the in-class demonstrations, such as ""resonance in circuits"" and ""phasors, graphs, and sin waves"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found in-class demonstrations to be particularly helpful in visualizing circuit concepts, such as resonance and phasors, through the use of visual aids like graphs, sin waves, and oscilloscopes, which aided in their comprehension of these concepts."
