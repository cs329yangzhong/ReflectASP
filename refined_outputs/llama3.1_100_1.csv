1. Consider breaking down the summary into two main points: one for the mathematical aspects of potential (integrals, bounds, etc.) and another for the conceptual aspects (dipoles, conductors, etc.). This will help to provide a clearer and more organized overview of the students' struggles.
2. Remove the phrase ""particularly with setting up and solving integrals for potential energy"" from the first sentence, as it is somewhat redundant and makes the sentence a bit wordy. This will help to make the summary more concise and focused on the main points.
3. Consider rephrasing the last sentence to ""Many students requested more examples and clarification on these topics to aid in their understanding"" to ""Students requested more examples and clarification on these topics to aid in their understanding, particularly in areas where they felt unclear or confused.""

Students found problem setup to be a significant challenge in the lecture on electric fields. Specifically, they struggled with determining the limits of integration and choosing the correct variable for the integral, which hindered their ability to apply calculus concepts to physics problems. This difficulty was evident in their struggles with setting up integrals for ring of charge problems, where they had trouble determining the differential element (dq) and understanding symmetry cancellation.

Students also faced challenges with specific types of problems, such as the linear charge integral, where they struggled to identify the limits of integration and understand the role of the variable L+d. Additionally, they found it difficult to determine the setup for charges and recognize which variable to use for the integral in different problems."

why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear. 
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz. 
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me. 
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?

The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.
I found it confusing defining what C equivalence was.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on capacitors to be clear, with some minor areas of confusion. Key points of confusion included the relationship between charge density and the electric field, the distribution of charge on capacitors in series and parallel configurations, and the application of formulas for capacitors in different circuits. Students also struggled with understanding when to use specific formulas, such as the equation for parallel capacitance versus the expression for equivalent capacitance. Visualizing and conceptualizing these concepts was also a challenge for some students.

Suggestions:
1.  To improve the summary, consider breaking down the points of confusion into two categories: conceptual understanding and formula application. This would allow for a clearer distinction between students' struggles with understanding the underlying concepts and their difficulties with applying the formulas.
2.  Emphasize the specific areas of confusion, such as the relationship between charge density and the electric field, and the distribution of charge on capacitors in series and parallel configurations, to provide a more detailed understanding of the students' challenges.
3.  Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific formulas and equations that students struggled with, such as the equation for parallel capacitance and the expression for equivalent capacitance, to provide a clearer picture of the students' difficulties with formula application.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on capacitors to be clear, with some minor areas of confusion.

36,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of electric and uniform fields to be challenging, particularly when it came to understanding the behavior of dipoles in uniform fields and the relationship between electric fields and forces. Many students struggled with visualizing and calculating the electric field around various charge distributions, including dipoles and top-hat charge configurations. Additionally, some students found it difficult to grasp the concept of electric potential energy, especially in the context of dipoles.",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

1.

I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""generally found"" and rephrase it to a more direct statement, such as ""Students found the TopHat questions engaging and helpful in making the material more interactive and easier to learn.""
2. To focus more on the topic of TopHat questions, consider removing the sentence ""The use of visuals, like videos and group work, also contributed to a better understanding of the topics."" as it is not directly related to TopHat questions, but rather to the overall teaching methods used in the lecture.
3. To make the summary more specific to the topic, consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students enjoyed the opportunity to work in breakout rooms and solve problems in pairs, finding it a valuable learning experience"" to something like ""Students appreciated the interactive aspect of TopHat questions, which allowed them to engage with the material in a collaborative and hands-on way.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the TopHat questions engaging and helpful in making the material more interactive and easier to learn. The real-world examples, such as the monkey problem, made complex concepts like projectile motion and relative velocity more relatable and interesting. The TopHat questions also allowed students to engage with the material in a collaborative and hands-on way, making the lecture more enjoyable and effective."
51,"SUMMARY: Students generally found vector addition to be an interesting topic, particularly when explained in a clear and step-by-step manner. Many appreciated the use of visual aids, such as drawings and diagrams, to help illustrate the concept. The idea of breaking down vectors into components and using trigonometry to add them was a key takeaway for several students. Some found it helpful to see how vector addition can be applied to real-world situations, such as the hockey and yeti examples. Overall, students appreciated the interactive nature of the lecture, including the use of breakout rooms and Top Hat questions, which helped to keep them engaged and motivated.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

Many appreciated the hands-on approach to learning, as it helped to clarify concepts and made the material more interesting. The use of real-world examples, such as the yeti and hockey problems, made the abstract concepts more relatable and applicable. Students enjoyed the variety of problem types and notations, and appreciated the opportunity to work in groups to practice and reinforce their understanding of vector addition and subtraction.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.

 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors.

 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.

Many appreciated the key concept that the coefficient of friction is usually less than 1, indicating that friction is a force that opposes motion. The idea that surface area does not affect friction, but rather the coefficient of friction and normal force do, was a common point of interest.

The interactive and conceptual questions, such as the top hat problems and breakout room discussions, were well-received by students, helping to solidify their understanding of the concept. Students also enjoyed learning about the different types of friction, including static and kinetic friction, and how they can be affected by factors such as the angle of push or pull. Overall, the lecture effectively engaged students and helped them grasp the fundamental principles of coefficient of friction."

The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant.

 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water

 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle

Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.

1. Consider breaking down the summary into two separate paragraphs to focus on the two main areas of confusion: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs, and the right-hand rule and vector operations (dot and cross products). This would allow for a more detailed exploration of each topic and provide a clearer understanding of the students' concerns.

2. Emphasize the common thread of confusion among students regarding the visualization and interpretation of Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs, and suggest that the instructor provide more examples and practice problems to help students better understand this concept.

3. Highlight the importance of providing clear and concise instructions for the Top Hat questions, as several students mentioned that the lack of directions made it difficult for them to understand the problems.","REFINED SUMMARY: 

Many students found the concept of Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs to be a challenging topic, with several expressing difficulty in understanding how to interpret and visualize these graphs. Students struggled with understanding the relationship between displacement and velocity, and how to graphically change from one to the other. They also had trouble with determining the direction of acceleration, particularly when it involves a change in direction. To better support students' understanding, providing more examples and practice problems that illustrate these concepts would be beneficial.

Additionally, students experienced confusion with the right-hand rule and vector operations, including the dot and cross products. They struggled with determining the direction of vectors, particularly in 2D graphs, and understanding the application of the right-hand rule. Moreover, some students found the Top Hat questions unclear due to a lack of directions, which hindered their ability to understand the problems. To address these concerns, providing clear and concise instructions for the Top Hat questions and offering more practice problems and examples that demonstrate the application of the right-hand rule and vector operations would be helpful."

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

I guess that if would’ve been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how youobtained the setup for the problem.
During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first butonce my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine.
We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I knowsome people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially otherkinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably takelonger)
I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult.","SUMMARY: Students found the dinosaur problem to be a point of confusion, with many struggling to understand how to determine the direction of acceleration for each dinosaur and how to combine their individual accelerations. Some students also found it challenging to decide which kinematic equation to use for the problem. The concept of negative and positive directions, particularly in the context of relative motion and the use of the right-hand rule, was also a source of confusion.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the concept of relative motion and how it affects the direction of acceleration in the dinosaur problem. This could be done by providing more examples or visual aids to illustrate how the direction of acceleration changes when considering relative motion.
2. Provide more guidance on how to choose the correct kinematic equation for the dinosaur problem, such as highlighting the key differences between the equations and when to use each one.
3. Consider providing additional practice problems that involve combining the accelerations of multiple objects in motion, such as the dinosaur problem, to help students become more comfortable with this type of problem and to reinforce their understanding of relative motion and kinematic equations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the dinosaur problem to be a point of confusion, with many struggling to understand how to determine the direction of acceleration for each dinosaur and how to combine their individual accelerations in the context of relative motion.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.

Relative Motion! I’m aware that it’s mainly vector addition /subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add /subtract.","Summary: Students found relative motion to be a challenging concept, particularly when it came to understanding when to add or subtract vectors and determining direction from different perspectives. Many students struggled with the monkey and bullet example and the concept of relative motion from a moving reference point. Students also had difficulty applying kinematic equations in different scenarios and determining velocities from different reference frames. In-class explanations and examples helped clarify the concept, but more practice problems and clarification on vector addition and subtraction would be beneficial for a deeper understanding.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of clearly explaining the monkey and bullet example, as many students found it confusing and it seems to be a common point of struggle.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to apply kinematic equations in different scenarios, as students found this to be a challenging aspect of relative motion.
3. Offer additional practice problems that focus on vector addition and subtraction in the context of relative motion, as students identified this as a key area of confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found relative motion to be a challenging concept, particularly when it came to understanding when to add or subtract vectors and determining direction from different perspectives.

Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on vector math to be clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. Many students struggled with determining when to add or subtract vectors, particularly when it comes to visualizing the direction of the resultant vector.

Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the use of angles in vector calculations, specifically when to add or subtract 180 degrees. However, with the help of examples and practice, students began to understand these concepts by the end of the lecture.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of visualizing the direction of resultant vectors when adding or subtracting vectors, and provide more examples to illustrate this concept.
2. Provide more context and explanation on the concept of unit vectors, including their purpose and application in vector calculations.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class.

 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after.

Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Summary: Students generally found the lecture on vector basics clear and easy to follow, with some minor confusions regarding the use of sin and cos in vector math, unit vectors, and when to add or subtract vectors. Many students struggled with the TopHat questions, citing difficulties with navigating the platform and understanding the correct answers. Some students also found it challenging to determine when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in word problems, and would benefit from more examples and practice.

Suggestions:
1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with some minor confusions"" and instead focus on the specific areas of confusion, such as ""Students had difficulties with the use of sin and cos in vector math, unit vectors, and determining when to add or subtract vectors.""
2. Emphasize the common thread among students' struggles with TopHat questions, which is not just navigating the platform, but also understanding the correct answers. This could be rephrased as ""Students struggled with understanding the correct answers to TopHat questions, in addition to navigating the platform.""
3. Consider adding a sentence to highlight the students' overall positive experience with the lecture, such as ""Despite some challenges, students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, indicating a strong foundation for future learning.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on vector basics clear and easy to follow, with some areas of confusion, particularly regarding the use of sin and cos in vector math, unit vectors, and determining when to add or subtract vectors, especially in word problems.

93,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and free body diagrams. Many students struggled with understanding how to approach problems involving two blocks, especially when one block is on top of another, and how to determine the forces acting on each block. Some students also found it difficult to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as how to use the coefficient of friction in equations. Additionally, students had trouble with combining forces and creating free body diagrams for complex systems, and some felt that more time was needed to work through these types of problems in class.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and free body diagrams. Many students struggled with understanding how to approach problems involving two blocks, especially when one block is on top of another, and how to determine the forces acting on each block. Some students also found it difficult to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as how to use the coefficient of friction in equations. Additionally, students had trouble with combining forces and creating free body diagrams for complex systems.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex systems into simpler components, and provide more examples of how to do this effectively, as many students found it helpful to split the problem into two systems.
2. Provide more detailed explanations of how to determine the forces acting on each block in a two-block system, particularly when one block is on top of another, as this was a common point of confusion for many students.
3. Offer more practice problems in class that focus on combining forces and creating free body diagrams for complex systems, and consider providing more time for students to work through these types of problems.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and free body diagrams.

 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.","Summary: Students found the concept of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and objects interacting with each other. They struggled to create and apply FBDs in complex scenarios, such as stacked or sliding blocks, and had difficulty determining the type of friction to use and how to apply it. Some students also had questions about the coefficient of friction and its relationship to the normal force. The concept of fs,max and its purpose was also a point of confusion.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable systems, as many students found it difficult to create FBDs for multiple interacting objects.
2. Provide more examples of how to determine the type of friction to use (static or kinetic) and how to apply it in different situations, as this was a common point of confusion.
3. Clarify the relationship between the coefficient of friction and the normal force, as some students were unclear about this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and objects interacting with each other. They struggled to create and apply FBDs in complex scenarios, such as stacked or sliding blocks, and had difficulty determining the type of friction to use and how to apply it. Key areas of confusion included the relationship between the coefficient of friction and the normal force, the purpose of fs,max, and how to determine the type of friction to use in different situations. To improve understanding, breaking down complex problems into smaller systems, providing more examples of friction application, and clarifying the coefficient of friction-normal force relationship would be beneficial."

 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting.

This will help to keep the summary on track and avoid diluting the focus on the main topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the concept of centripetal force to be challenging, particularly in understanding why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle. They also struggled with applying centripetal force in various scenarios, including the example of a skydiver entering the ocean and deriving equations for circular motion. Additionally, students had difficulty grasping how velocity changes when transitioning between different substances, such as air and water, and understanding the impact of different densities on circular motion."
105,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of terminal velocity to be challenging, particularly in understanding how to set up equations and account for variables such as air and water density. Many students struggled with the application of drag force and its impact on terminal velocity, including determining when it begins and ends in different substances. Additionally, some students found it difficult to conceptualize the interaction between forces, including centripetal force, and how they relate to terminal velocity.",Terminal Velocity,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider grouping similar concerns together, such as combining the comments about drag force and terminal velocity under a single point, rather than listing them separately. This would help to highlight the main areas of confusion and make the summary more focused on the topic of terminal velocity.
2. To further emphasize the topic, consider removing comments that are not directly related to terminal velocity, such as the discussion of centripetal force and circular motion, and instead focus on the specific challenges students faced with terminal velocity.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus on the specific challenges students faced with setting up equations and understanding the variables involved in terminal velocity, rather than just stating that students found the concept challenging. This would provide a clearer picture of the areas where students need additional support.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand how to set up equations for terminal velocity, particularly when accounting for variables such as air and water density.

Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing.

Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""generally found Assignment 12 to be engaging and interesting"" as it's a general statement and not a specific reflection from the students. Instead, focus on the specific aspects that students enjoyed, such as applying real-world engineering practices and concepts.
2. Emphasize the variety of skills and concepts that students appreciated, such as using Excel for calculations and graphing, analyzing instantaneous rate of change, and applying mathematical concepts like slope and unit conversions. This will give a clearer picture of the range of activities that students found engaging.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Many appreciated the time spent in breakout rooms to work on the assignment with their teams"" to ""Students valued the collaborative work in breakout rooms, finding it helpful for understanding and completing the assignment."" This change makes the language more specific and focused on the benefits of the breakout room experience.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students appreciated applying real-world engineering practices and concepts to Assignment 12, finding it engaging and relevant.

1.  To further emphasize the focus on calculations, consider rephrasing the summary to explicitly state that students enjoyed the hands-on experience of applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems, rather than just mentioning the project as a whole. This could be achieved by changing the sentence ""Students found the application of calculations in the context of the Taum Sauk project to be engaging and interesting"" to ""Students enjoyed applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems, particularly in regards to calculating power, volumetric flow rate, and instantaneous rate of change.""
2.  To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in regards to"" from the original summary. This phrase is not essential to the meaning of the sentence and can be omitted without affecting the clarity of the summary.
3.  To highlight the importance of Excel in the calculations, consider adding a sentence to the summary that explicitly states the students' appreciation for using Excel to analyze data and create line charts. This could be achieved by adding a sentence such as ""Students appreciated the opportunity to use Excel to analyze data and create line charts, which helped them visualize and understand the calculations.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students enjoyed applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems, particularly in regards to calculating power, volumetric flow rate, and instantaneous rate of change.

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider condensing the information by focusing on the most common themes and ideas expressed by the students. For example, instead of mentioning ""various perspectives and stakeholders,"" you could simply state that students appreciated the importance of considering multiple viewpoints.
2.  To emphasize the students' engagement with the problem scoping process, consider using more active verbs, such as ""engaged"" or ""enjoyed,"" to describe their experiences. This will help to create a more dynamic and enthusiastic tone in the summary.
3.  To further highlight the relevance of the problem scoping process to the students' learning experience, consider adding more specific details about how the process will help them apply the skills learned throughout the semester to real-world problems. For example, you could mention that students appreciated the opportunity to ""develop a deeper understanding of the design process"" or ""apply their knowledge to a more complex and open-ended project.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students engaged enthusiastically with the problem scoping process, appreciating the hands-on experience of working in groups to generate ideas and develop a clear understanding of the project's scope. They enjoyed considering multiple viewpoints and stakeholders, and valued the flexibility and relevance of the project to real-world problems, such as campus mobility. By applying the skills learned throughout the semester to this open-ended project, students developed a deeper understanding of the design process and were excited to tackle the challenge."

I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.

Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later. 
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about. 
 I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
 That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
 I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13.

It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints","SUMMARY: Students found the carbon footprint calculations and activity to be a thought-provoking and engaging part of the lecture. Many were surprised to learn that their individual carbon footprint is higher than expected, and some were shocked to discover how many ""earths"" would be required if everyone lived like them. The use of a website to calculate their carbon footprint was a valuable learning experience, allowing students to see the impact of their daily choices on the environment. Additionally, the discussion on trade-offs and the ethical considerations of engineering in the context of climate change sparked interesting conversations and reflections.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the specific aspect of the website used for carbon footprint calculations, such as the ""how many earths"" concept, to make the summary more specific and focused on the topic.
2. Consider removing the phrase ""and some were shocked to discover"" to make the summary more concise and focused on the overall reaction of the students.

It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.
 when assignment a11 is due and what our in class quiz is on

This would help to distill the main points and make the summary more concise.
2. Emphasize the need for more explanation and details on the laminar approach, as many students felt that this was a major area of confusion. This could be phrased as a request for more clarification on the concept and its application in assignments.
3. Consider breaking down the summary into two separate points: one for the clarity of the lecture and one for the confusion surrounding the laminar approach. This would allow for a more nuanced summary that highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of the lecture.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture straightforward and clear, with helpful examples and explanations. However, confusion surrounding the laminar approach was a major area of concern, particularly in understanding its application in relation to volume and height calculations, as well as the use of statistical measures such as r^2, SSE, and SST. Many students felt that more explanation and details were needed to clarify the concept and its use in assignments, highlighting the need for additional clarification on the laminar approach in future lectures."

Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""most stating that nothing was confusing"" as it is not directly related to the topic of Power Calculation. The summary should focus on the specific points related to Power Calculation.
2. To improve the clarity of the summary, consider rephrasing the sentence ""the factors that contribute to pressure head"" to ""the factors that contribute to pressure head, specifically height, as some students were unclear about this"". This will make it clear that the focus is on the specific aspect of pressure head.
3. Consider adding a sentence to highlight the positive aspect of the students' understanding of Power Calculation, such as ""Students generally showed a good understanding of the concept of Power Calculation, with many feeling confident in their ability to apply the concepts to the project"". This will provide a more balanced view of the students' understanding of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally showed a good understanding of the concept of Power Calculation, with many feeling confident in their ability to apply the concepts to the project.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider grouping similar themes together, such as combining the issues with assignment 16 and project scope into a single point. This would reduce the number of distinct points mentioned and make the summary more focused.

2. To provide more clarity, consider adding specific examples or quotes from the reflections to illustrate the points made in the summary. For example, instead of saying ""some students struggled to understand the expectations for assignment 16,"" you could say ""students mentioned conflicting messages in different places in Brightspace, such as the assignment document and other class materials, which needed clarification.""

3. To make the summary more impactful, consider rephrasing some of the points to highlight the root cause of the confusion, rather than just stating the confusion itself. For example, instead of saying ""some students were unclear about the location of the assignment document,"" you could say ""students were confused because the assignment document was not easily accessible or clearly communicated to them.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the instructions for the in-class assignment and project unclear, citing confusion about the project scope, specific tasks, and required deliverables. Specifically, students struggled with assignment 16, which had conflicting messages in different places in Brightspace, making it unclear what was expected. Additionally, students were confused by the open-ended nature of the assignment and the lack of clear guidance on problem scoping and stakeholder identification. Furthermore, some students were frustrated by the inconsistent availability of class materials, such as the quiz and slides, before class, which hindered their ability to prepare."
157,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the explanation of the deliverables for Assignment 16 to be confusing, with many expressing uncertainty about what was required for the assignment, including the specific tasks and information needed to complete it. Some students also found it difficult to locate the project document and understand the expectations for the assignment, with conflicting messages in different places in Brightspace contributing to the confusion. Additionally, the open-ended nature of the assignment and the time constraint added to the confusion, with some students unsure about how to proceed with research and gathering information from stakeholders.",Deliverables,"The class wasn't confusing today.

 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers.

I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container

 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.

 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms.

 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions

 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask

The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on.

 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.

 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren't talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don't really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing

 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing

 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly Assignment 8"" and instead focus on the general theme of assignment-related confusion, as many students mentioned difficulties with multiple assignments. This would help to convey that the issue is not limited to one specific assignment.

Example: ""Students generally felt that the details regarding assignments were unclear or confusing, with many struggling with understanding the instructions, data handling, and expectations.""

2. To provide more specific information, consider breaking down the summary into separate sentences or bullet points to highlight the different areas where students struggled, such as data handling, navigation of the Brightspace platform, and explanation of z-scores and probability.

Example: ""Students struggled with understanding the instructions and data handling for assignments, particularly with regards to missing data and data analysis. Many also found it challenging to navigate the Brightspace platform to find the correct assignment and due dates. Additionally, there were concerns about the explanation of z-scores, probability, and the process of finding the probability of a Skittles bag having over 27% yellow Skittles.""

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence about the Brightspace platform, as it is not directly related to the details regarding assignments. This would help to keep the summary focused on the specific topic and avoid introducing unrelated information.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally felt that the details regarding assignments were unclear or confusing, with many struggling with understanding the instructions, data handling, and expectations.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.

 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.

 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of clients, users, and stakeholders to be somewhat confusing, particularly in terms of distinguishing between these roles and understanding their relevance to the project. Some students struggled with identifying stakeholders and clients, and how to incorporate them into the project. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the process of empathizing with users, especially for online students who may not have direct interactions with campus users. The difference between criteria and constraints was also a point of confusion for some students.

Suggestions:
1. To improve the summary, consider condensing the first sentence to focus on the main point of confusion: ""Students struggled to understand the distinction between clients, users, and stakeholders, and their roles in the project.""
2. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion, such as the process of empathizing with users and the difference between criteria and constraints, to provide a clearer picture of the students' understanding.
3. Consider removing the phrase ""especially for online students"" to make the summary more concise and focused on the general point of confusion, rather than a specific subgroup.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the distinction between clients, users, and stakeholders, and their roles in the project. Confusion arose from identifying stakeholders and clients, incorporating them into the project, and empathizing with users.

I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project

 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons

 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.

I enjoyed calculating the carbon footprint of my car. It was also interesting to observe what actions impact our climate.
I found the striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming very interesting
I found the photos that were shown on climate change to be really interesting, they effectively show the large influence of global warming.","Summary: Students found the lecture on climate change and its impact on the environment to be engaging and thought-provoking. Many were particularly interested in learning about their personal carbon footprint and how everyday actions contribute to climate change. The in-class activity of calculating the CO2 emissions of their vehicles was a highlight, with students expressing surprise at the significant impact of their cars on the environment. The discussion on design trade-offs and the importance of considering the environmental effects of engineering projects also resonated with students. Overall, the lecture sparked a sense of awareness and responsibility among students, with many expressing interest in learning more about renewable energy and ways to mitigate climate change.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the impact of surprise and realization among students: The summary could be strengthened by highlighting the students' reactions to learning about their personal carbon footprint and the significant impact of their cars on the environment. This could be phrased as ""students were surprised to learn about the significant impact of their daily actions on climate change"" to emphasize the emotional connection.
2. Use more specific language to describe the design trade-offs discussion: Instead of a general statement, the summary could specify what aspects of design trade-offs resonated with students, such as ""students found the discussion on balancing environmental impact with engineering goals particularly interesting"" to provide more depth.
3. Clarify the connection to engineering projects: The summary could be strengthened by explicitly stating how the discussion on climate change and design trade-offs will influence students' approach to their engineering projects, such as ""students began to consider the environmental implications of their project designs and how they can incorporate sustainable solutions"" to emphasize the practical application.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on climate change and its impact on the environment to be engaging and thought-provoking.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today

 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

How to calculate environmental impact of the solar panels for a13","Suggestions:

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about the carbon footprint calculation and the inclusion of gasoline density, into a single sentence. This will help to reduce repetition and make the summary more focused.
2.  The summary could be improved by highlighting the specific aspects of the calculations and analysis that students found challenging, rather than just stating that they found certain aspects of the lecture confusing. For example, instead of saying ""the in-class activity and calculations related to environmental analysis were the most challenging aspects,"" consider specifying what exactly was challenging, such as ""students struggled with converting data from A13 to calculate carbon footprint"" or ""students were unclear about the equation used in the in-class activity.""
3.  To make the summary more focused on the topic of Calculations/Analysis, consider removing or downplaying the mention of the clear explanation of trade-offs and climate change, as it is not directly related to the calculations and analysis.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the carbon footprint calculation to be the most challenging aspect of the lecture, with many struggling to convert data from A13 and understand the inclusion of gasoline density. Additionally, there was confusion about the use of assumptions in calculations and how to communicate them effectively. Some students also had difficulty with the equation used in the in-class activity and understanding how it applied to environmental analysis. Overall, the lecture provided a solid foundation for calculations and analysis, but students would benefit from more detailed explanations and examples to support these concepts."

 SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on gas density to be straightforward and easy to understand. However, some students were unclear about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity, and a few found the carbon footprint calculation confusing due to a lack of understanding of the environmental data from A13. Additionally, some students struggled with determining the difference between assumptions and unreliable data.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of gas density in the context of the in-class activity to avoid confusion about its relevance. This could be achieved by providing more explicit connections between the lecture material and the in-class activity.
2. Provide more guidance on how to calculate CO2 emissions, particularly in relation to the environmental data from A13, to address the confusion surrounding the carbon footprint calculation.
3. Clarify the distinction between assumptions and unreliable data to help students better understand the concept and apply it in their work.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on gas density to be straightforward and easy to understand. However, some students were unclear about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity, and a few found the carbon footprint calculation confusing due to a lack of understanding of the environmental data from A13. To improve understanding, providing explicit connections between the lecture material and the in-class activity, and offering more guidance on calculating CO2 emissions would be beneficial."
226,"SUMMARY: Students found the prototyping aspect of the lecture to be the most engaging and interesting part of the class. Many students appreciated the hands-on experience of brainstorming and working with peers to generate ideas and solutions, as well as learning about various methods and tools for prototyping, such as CAD software and 3D printing. Students also enjoyed exploring different materials and services available for prototyping, including those offered by Purdue's ITAP. Additionally, the process of creating prototypes and testing their effectiveness was seen as a valuable learning experience, allowing students to make informed decisions and refine their designs.",Prototyping,"The thing that was the most interesting was working with my peers to generate ideas and solutions

 One thing that was confusing about today's class was are the exploring prior art supposed to be just general things being done or are they supposed to relate specifically to our ideas that we generated?
 Nothing was confusing in today's class! The in-class activity made a lot of sense and really helped us when generating ideas. 
 It was really confusing to follow what is expected from Assignment 17, I still don't fully understand what is expected of us.",426,"I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don’t drink coffee, so I didn’t really have much perspective for the problem.
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers

I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn’t have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would’ve been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information.
I was confused as to how indepth the pro’s and con’s diagram should be.
The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first.
The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider grouping similar issues together, such as combining the difficulties with the coffee makers and biomimicry into a single point, e.g., ""Students had trouble with specific aspects of the in-class activity, including understanding the depth of analysis required, clarifying the type of solution needed, and accessing information about the coffee makers, as well as applying the concept of biomimicry to the assignment.""
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing points that are not directly related to the in-class activity, such as the difficulties with Assignment 17 and the iteration section.
3. To make the summary more specific, consider using more precise language, such as ""some students had difficulty understanding the requirements for the French press"" instead of ""clarifying the type of solution needed.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the in-class activity on identifying pros and cons to be straightforward, but some had difficulty with specific aspects, including understanding the depth of analysis required, accessing information about the coffee makers, and applying the concept of biomimicry to the assignment. Some students also struggled with clarifying the requirements for the French press and the number of pros and cons to be listed."

Some students also found it challenging to understand the differences between various linearization approaches. However, most students were able to grasp the concepts and complete the in-class video assignment with ease.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing on the specific difficulties with MATLAB implementation mentioned by students, such as ""got confused about the way to implement the different linearization methods, especially through matlab"" and ""confusing about the making of the michaelis menten plots and how you would linearize the Michaelis menten equation"", to provide more clarity on this topic.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the differences between various linearization approaches, as mentioned by students who found it ""somewhat confusing was the difference between the linearization approaches taught"" and ""did not understand why you would further rearrange to get the variables in the eadie Hofstee method when the line weaver method already has it in slope intercept form"".
3. Highlight the need for more guidance on data manipulation, particularly for calculating initial velocity, as mentioned by students who were ""confused on how to manipulate the data we are given to be able to calculate the initial velocity"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on linearization to be clear and understandable, with some minor points of confusion regarding the implementation of different linearization methods, particularly through MATLAB.

I thought that figuring out how to determine the combinations/permutations of cards to use when trying to find specific hands was a bit difficult.
Picking out cards from a deck for a flush, straight flush, etc
Understanding the difference between finding ranks and finding card values as well as the exact thought process for a flush calculation took much effort on my part and needed more details.","Summary: Students found the probability calculations for specific poker hand combinations, such as flushes and straights, to be challenging. Many struggled with determining when to use permutations or combinations, particularly when dealing with suits, and understanding the importance of order in these calculations. Students also had difficulty distinguishing between finding ranks and card values, and required more guidance on the thought process involved in calculating certain hand combinations.

The right hand rule of either using the 3 fingers or 2 fingers","SUMMARY: Students found the Right Hand Rule to be a source of confusion, particularly in determining the direction of magnetic fields when multiple currents are involved. Many students struggled with understanding which finger to use for the rule and how to apply it to different scenarios, such as counter-clockwise flowing loops of current. Some students also found it difficult to determine whether magnetic fields would cancel out or amplify each other. The reversibility of the Right Hand Rule and its application to more complex problems, such as systems with multiple unknowns, was also a point of confusion.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the finger usage for the Right Hand Rule: The summary mentions that students are unsure about which finger to use for the rule, suggesting that a clear explanation of the finger usage would help alleviate this confusion. This could be done by explicitly stating which finger corresponds to which component of the magnetic field or current.
2. Provide more examples of Right Hand Rule application: The summary highlights that students struggle with applying the Right Hand Rule to different scenarios, such as counter-clockwise flowing loops of current. Providing more examples and practice problems that demonstrate the application of the rule in various situations would help students become more confident in their understanding.
3. Emphasize the relationship between magnetic field direction and cancellation: The summary notes that students are unsure about whether magnetic fields will cancel out or amplify each other. Emphasizing the relationship between the direction of magnetic fields and how they interact with each other would help students better understand this concept and apply the Right Hand Rule more effectively.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the Right Hand Rule to be a source of confusion, particularly in determining the direction of magnetic fields when multiple currents are involved.
