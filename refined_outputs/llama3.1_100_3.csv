1.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points into a single sentence. For example, the original summary mentions ""determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge"" and ""setting up integrals for the electric field"" separately. These could be combined into a single sentence, such as ""Students struggled with applying Calculus concepts to Physics problems, particularly when setting up integrals for the electric field, including determining the correct variable of integration and deciding when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge.""
2.  Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific problem areas that students found challenging, rather than the general topics. For example, instead of saying ""students found the initial setup of the problem to be confusing,"" the summary could say ""students struggled with setting up the ring of charge problem, particularly with determining the correct variable of integration and setting the limits of integration.""
3.  To make the summary more focused on the topic of Problem Set up, consider removing sentences that mention specific problems or examples that were covered in the lecture, such as the ""water droplet problem"" or the ""practice problem with the dipole dipole moment."" These can be seen as distractions from the main topic of problem setup, and can make the summary feel less focused.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with setting up the ring of charge problem, particularly with determining the correct variable of integration and setting the limits of integration.

The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral. 
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel. 
Series capacitors and resistance 
Deciding between parallel and series 
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators
 The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.

The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3.

I really enjoyed the top hat question with the negative cosine angle, causing the dot product to be negative even though it was scalar. I go the question incorrect but I liked how it was explained and I learned a lot from it.
The thing that I found most interesting was the right hand demonstration for vectors 
Velocity and acceleration and their graphs
The variety of problems, it gave some range to the material that wasn't in the videos or their example problems.
 The right hand rule is clearer to me after Dr. Nero explained it again in class
 Top hat
 Seeing the right hand rule explained live was very helpful and I liked the toy car demo. 
 I really liked the description of the graphs between acceleration, velocity, and displacement. I've had trouble with them in the past but I feel like I have a good understanding now. 
 the graphical version of position vs. velocity vs. acceleration was an interesting and helpful concept to know and see
 i found doing vector problems in context interesting. instead of just finding the dot or cross product and being given everything we need, we had to sort of figure out a way to find the dot product with only 3 sides of a triangle 
 Probably the acceleration and velocity problems. I've always found these aspects to be the most interesting part of physics, and I enjoyed working on them in high school physics.
 I liked the break out rooms

 End questions 
 I enjoyed the Top Hat question about the Right Hand Rule because I was able to practice visualizing the location of the 3-D vector.
 I found the live demonstration interesting. It is always useful to see physics happening in real life. It makes all the work seem real and obtainable. We can forget that all this math has real applications.
 The right-hand rule was very interesting for me because it is something I've never seen in action before. I was a little confused about it during the reading, but what was talked about in class helped me to get the hang of what it's all about.

1. Emphasize the connection between the right-hand rule and the cross product: The original summary mentions the right-hand rule, but it could be more explicitly linked to the cross product. For example, the summary could state that the right-hand rule is a key concept in understanding the cross product, and that it was a highlight of the lecture.

2. Clarify the role of live demonstrations: While the summary mentions live demonstrations as a highlight, it could be more specific about how these demonstrations helped students understand the cross product. For example, it could mention that the toy car demo helped students visualize the concept of the cross product in a real-world context.

3. Remove the mention of unrelated concepts: The original summary mentions the dot product and its relation to work, but this is not directly related to the cross product. The summary could focus more tightly on the cross product and its related concepts, such as the right-hand rule and the use of graphs to relate position, velocity, and acceleration.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the cross product concept to be particularly interesting, with many highlighting the importance of the right-hand rule in understanding it.

What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It’s like a puzzle to me.
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need.
Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems ofequations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way.
problems including two objects colliding, using both objects’ acceleration
I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero.
The problems were engaging
Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem
The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet onesince they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and droprate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem
top hat questions
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand ofthe topic we’re on.
Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was mostinteresting because I like the application process of equations.
I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations,each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I hadonly been given the equations. They weren’t equally explained.

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the process of ""picking equations"" rather than just ""problem-solving"", as the original summary seems to lean more towards the enjoyment of solving problems rather than the specific skill of selecting the right equation for the situation. This could be achieved by highlighting the students' appreciation for learning how to choose the correct kinematic equation for a given problem.
2. Emphasize the variety of scenarios and examples that students found engaging, such as free fall, projectile motion, collisions, and real-world applications, to give a more comprehensive view of the topic. This could be done by breaking down the summary into separate sentences or phrases that highlight these different examples.
3. Use more specific language to describe the students' experiences, such as ""students enjoyed the challenge of using different kinematic equations to solve the same problem"" could be rephrased to ""students appreciated the flexibility of kinematic equations and the ability to choose the most suitable equation for each problem"". This would make the summary more precise and focused on the topic of picking equations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students appreciated the flexibility of kinematic equations and the ability to choose the most suitable equation for each problem, as they enjoyed rearranging and substituting equations to solve for different variables.

 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
 I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
 Calculating 2-D motion
 I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
 The group questions
 The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch. 
 I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
 The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
 The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
 understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
 Monkey problem.
 falling monkey
 I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems. 
 Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
 The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole 
 The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating. 
 I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
 projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant 
 The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent. 
 The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
 I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other. 
 projectile motion and falling monkey
 I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about. 
 The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
 The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
 The FBD drawings 
 I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the specific benefits of TopHat questions, such as ""Students found the TopHat questions engaging and interactive, making the lecture more enjoyable and preventing zoning out."" This would help to highlight the key advantage of using TopHat questions in the class.
2. Emphasize the connection between the TopHat questions and the specific topics covered in the lecture, such as projectile motion and relative motion. This could be done by adding a sentence like ""The TopHat questions effectively reinforced students' understanding of these complex concepts, particularly the independence of horizontal and vertical motions.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""particularly projectile motion"" from the original summary, as it is implied that the TopHat questions were used to teach this topic. This would make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of TopHat questions.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the TopHat questions engaging and interactive, making the lecture more enjoyable and preventing zoning out.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.

 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.

 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.

The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one

How you could put more than one object in a system 
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.

 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.

the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.
Surprised by the answer to the second question, I thought the lower block was just put in to confuse us
Calculating the coefficient of friction for sandpaper

Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
 Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
 It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction. 
 The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
 I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we've been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting. 
 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
 Break out room discussions
 I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style. 
 the concept of static friction changing with the force against it
 I enjoyed applying the coefficients of friction to a box on a slope.
 I really enjoyed the conceptual TopHat questions. I feel like they help me in application problems later in lecture and in the homework.

 Free body diagrams of systems 
 How pulling is more efficient than pushing
 The problem about pushing or pulling a sled, in particular how the angle you push an object changes the force you need to move it
 What I found most interesting in today's lecture was the conceptual questions. The sled question tricked me a little so it was interesting to see what the answer was and why.
 Use of multiple free body diagrams in one problem
 That it is easier to prevent an object from moving than to slow it down with friction
 I thought that learning that surface area didn't really contribute to the force of friction was interesting
 I like the question with the two blocks where one was pushed on top of the other.
 I found the his explanation with the force of friction interesting
 I thought the fact that more SA being on a surface not creating for static friction was interesting
 I found the fact that you can find the coefficient of friction by simply knowing theta. 
 i was interested by the idea that pulling is easier than pushing and the math behind it

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating redundant phrases. For example, the original summary mentions ""static and kinetic friction"" and ""normal force"" separately, but they are closely related concepts. Combining them into a single sentence could make the summary more efficient.

2. Consider adding more specific details from the reflections to support the main points. For example, the original summary mentions that students found the application of friction to real-life scenarios interesting, but it could be more specific by mentioning the sandpaper example or the sled problem.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Coefficient of Friction, consider removing sentences that mention broader aspects of the lecture, such as ""interactive aspects"" or ""real-life scenarios."" This will help to keep the summary tightly focused on the specific topic of Coefficient of Friction.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of Coefficient of Friction engaging, particularly the relationship between static and kinetic friction, normal force, and the coefficient of friction. Many appreciated the application of friction to real-life scenarios, such as the sandpaper example, and the idea that surface area does not affect friction, but rather the normal force and the coefficient of friction. The interactive aspects of the lecture, including top hat questions and breakout room discussions, helped students solidify their understanding of the material, particularly the concept of static friction changing with the force against it and the ease of preventing an object from moving versus slowing it down with friction."

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing

The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.

 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity

 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water

 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle

1.  **Clarify the connection between centripetal force and drag force**: While the summary mentions that students enjoyed the incorporation of drag force into the equations, it would be beneficial to explicitly highlight how centripetal force is affected by drag force, as seen in the reflections where students found it interesting to compare drag force and gravity in different fluids.
2.  **Emphasize the concept of acceleration in centripetal motion**: The summary touches on the idea that acceleration can be constant even when velocity is not, but it would be helpful to further emphasize this concept, as it seems to be a point of fascination for many students, such as the example of hitting water at terminal velocity.
3.  **Include the ""aha"" moment of centripetal force being a result of other forces**: Some students mentioned that they found it interesting that centripetal force isn't a new force, but rather a result of other forces acting on an object in circular motion. This could be highlighted in the summary to provide a more nuanced understanding of the concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of centripetal force to be particularly engaging, with many appreciating its real-life applications and the incorporation of drag force into the equations. They enjoyed learning how to apply centripetal force to various scenarios, such as the skier and pendulum free body diagrams, and found it interesting to see how acceleration can be constant even when velocity is not. Notably, students were fascinated by the extreme acceleration experienced when hitting water at terminal velocity, and the concept of terminal velocity itself was a common point of interest. Furthermore, students appreciated the explanation of uniform centripetal motion and how different forces, including drag force, act on an object in circular motion, often resulting in a net centripetal force that is not a new force, but rather a combination of other forces. This nuanced understanding of centripetal force and its relationship with drag force and other forces will likely aid in their problem-solving skills."

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

The main points of confusion revolved around the use of sine and cosine functions in vector math, particularly when to use each and how to determine the correct angle. Additionally, some students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, with some finding it confusing to determine the direction of the resultant vector. Students also had questions about unit vectors, including their purpose and how to use them. Overall, students appreciated the use of visual aids and in-class examples to help illustrate key concepts, but some felt that more practice and clarification on certain topics would be beneficial.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the quadrant in which a vector lies when determining the correct angle for sine and cosine functions, as some students mentioned struggling with this concept.
2. Provide more explicit examples and practice problems to help students understand when to add or subtract vectors, and how to determine the direction of the resultant vector.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.

 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it.

 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",88,"Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end.
I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.
Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took awayfrom the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we allget used to the format.
I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling.
The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did.
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning ofthe lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after Iused it for the first question I got the hang of it.
For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract.
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB.

A few students felt that the incorrect answers were not thoroughly explained, making it difficult for them to understand where they went wrong. Some students also expressed a desire for more practice with TopHat and clarification on the program's functionality before the first question.

Suggestions:
1. Provide more detailed explanations for incorrect TopHat answers, to help students understand where they went wrong and what they need to work on.
2. Consider offering additional practice with TopHat before the first question, to help students become more comfortable with the platform and its functionality.
3.

stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and free body diagrams. Many students struggled with understanding how to combine forces and create equations for systems with multiple blocks, especially when one block is on top of another. Some students also found it difficult to determine the type of friction to use and how to apply it in different scenarios. Additionally, students had trouble with understanding the concept of the coefficient of friction and its relationship to the normal force.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and provide more examples of how to do this effectively.
2. Provide more clarification on the difference between kinetic and static friction, and how to apply them in different scenarios, including real-world examples.

 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.

Many students struggled with combining FBDs for multiple objects and identifying the correct type of friction to apply. Some students were also unsure about rearranging formulas and solving for unknown forces. However, the interactive lecture format and example problems boosted some students' confidence in understanding force problems, and the instructor's explanations were generally clear, with some students appreciating real-world examples.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of labeling and identifying forces in FBDs, particularly for multi-block systems, as many students struggled with this concept.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to determine the correct type of friction (static or kinetic) to apply in different situations, as this was a common point of confusion.
3. Offer additional examples and practice problems that demonstrate how to rearrange formulas and solve for unknown forces, as this was a skill that many students struggled with.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multi-block systems and determining the forces acting on each block.

For example, ""Students found the concept of centripetal force and its application in various scenarios, including drag force, to be the most challenging aspect of the lecture.""
2.  Consider removing the phrase ""with many struggling to understand"" as it is a vague statement. Instead, focus on the specific points of confusion mentioned by the students, such as ""why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle"" and ""how to apply the drag force formula.""
3.  To make the summary more focused on the topic of Circular Motion, consider removing the mention of terminal velocity, as it is not directly related to circular motion. The summary should focus on the key concepts and challenges related to circular motion, such as centripetal force, drag force, and their applications.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of centripetal force and its application in various scenarios, including drag force, to be the most challenging aspect of the lecture. They struggled to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle and how to apply the drag force formula, particularly in scenarios involving different densities and transitions between air and water.

I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.

 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.

 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing. 
 Everything is pretty clear 
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 Nothing was really confusing to me today. 
 WDM
 The decision matrix
 I'm confused on how we are supposed to test our prototypes
 How metrics were different than criteria 
 I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
 The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
 Nothing was confusing and the weighted decision matrix was actually explained very well.
 i am running on not much sleep everything is confusing including English ",109,"it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgotthat we didn’t have to do the whole thing, so I got confused.
It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
I wasn’t completely sure about what to do for the in class activitybecause the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had todo some of it, but it wasn’t completely clear about what parts we weresupposed to do.
I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the modulevideo but I didn’t feel that we talked about making these models a lotuntil after we did the in-class activity.
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
I just think the assignments are confusing.","Suggestions:

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points into a single sentence. For example, the multiple mentions of ""confusion"" regarding the in-class activity could be condensed into a single sentence, such as ""Students found the in-class activity on the weighted decision matrix to be confusing, with unclear instructions on what to complete and how to distinguish between the criteria and metrics sections.""
2.  To improve the summary's focus on the topic, consider removing or rephrasing sentences that mention unrelated topics, such as the due date of assignment 18 or the instructor's presence in breakout rooms. This will help maintain a clear and focused summary.
3.  To enhance the summary's clarity, consider reorganizing the sentences to group related ideas together. For example, the summary could start by highlighting the positive aspects of the in-class activity, followed by the challenges and areas of confusion. This will create a more balanced and organized summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the in-class activity on the weighted decision matrix (WDM) to be confusing, with unclear instructions on what to complete and how to distinguish between the criteria and metrics sections. Some students also struggled with understanding the xsl file format, determining specific numbers for metrics, and the process of testing prototypes. However, many appreciated the clear explanation of the WDM concept, and a few found the activity straightforward."

 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email. 
 How to use excel 
 How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.
 I enjoyed meeting new people in my breakout rooms and seeing what they drew for the in class activity.",118,"The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find thesolution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel
The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting.
Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups
I enjoyed meeting new people in my breakout rooms and seeing what they drew for the in class activity.","Summary: Students found the hands-on experience of analyzing data from the CoGo Bike Share project in Excel to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture. They appreciated the opportunity to work in breakout rooms and collaborate with peers to discuss and share ideas. Many students found the concept of problem statements and the process of scoping to be particularly interesting, and valued the chance to learn from and interact with their classmates. The use of chat and breakout rooms facilitated effective communication and teamwork, allowing students to work together to analyze data and come up with potential solutions to the problem.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of peer-to-peer learning: The summary highlights the value of students learning from and interacting with each other, but it could be more explicit in stating how this experience helped students develop their communication and teamwork skills.
2. Focus on the specific communication tools used: The summary mentions the use of chat and breakout rooms, but it could be more detailed in explaining how these tools facilitated effective communication and collaboration among students.
3. Highlight the role of active participation: The summary mentions that students found the hands-on experience engaging, but it could be more specific in stating how students' active participation in the breakout rooms and discussions contributed to their learning and understanding of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the hands-on experience of analyzing data from the CoGo Bike Share project in Excel to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture.

Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have beencovered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculationsfor energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculationsin.
I don’t know why researchers use so many units","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be straightforward and clear, with most students stating that they were not confused about anything or that everything made sense. However, some students expressed confusion regarding the specifics of energy units, such as understanding the differences between various units and how to apply them in calculations. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the procedure for the in-class assignment, particularly regarding the use of conversion tools and the expectations for the project.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider breaking it down into two separate paragraphs, one focusing on the clarity of the lecture and the other on the specific areas of confusion, such as energy units and in-class assignment procedures. This would allow for a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the students' reflections.
2. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with most students stating that they were not confused about anything or that everything made sense"" as it is implied in the first sentence that the lecture was clear.
3. Consider adding more specific language to highlight the areas of confusion, such as ""students struggled to understand the differences between various energy units"" or ""students were unclear about the expectations for the in-class assignment regarding conversion tools"". This would provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the students' reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be straightforward and clear.

 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.

1. Emphasize the specific inconsistency in the CO2 emission values: Instead of a general statement about discrepancies, the summary could focus on the specific issue with the CO2 emission values per gallon of gasoline, highlighting that the numbers on the Brightspace slides and in-class presentation were inconsistent, leading to confusion.
2. Clarify the source of confusion for the in-class participation: The summary mentions that some students found the conversion process unclear, but it's not clear if this is due to the Brightspace slides, the in-class presentation, or both. To improve the summary, it would be helpful to specify which source of the in-class participation caused confusion.
3. Remove the mention of the in-class participation format and final answer: The summary mentions that a few students were unsure about the format and final answer required for the in-class participation. However, this is not directly related to the CO2 emission calculations, and removing this sentence would make the summary more focused on the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the CO2 emission calculations straightforward, but some students experienced confusion due to the inconsistency in the value of grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline, with different numbers presented on the Brightspace slides and in-class presentation.

The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.

 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!!

However, some students expressed confusion regarding the application of the laminar approach, particularly in relation to assignments A10 and A11. Specifically, students struggled with understanding how to use the laminar approach to calculate volume and height, and were unclear about the requirements for the assignments. Additionally, some students found the concepts of SSE, SST, and r^2 to be confusing, and would have appreciated more detailed explanations in class.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation.","SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be straightforward and clear, with helpful examples and explanations. However, some students expressed confusion regarding the application of the laminar approach, particularly in relation to assignments A10 and A11. Specifically, students struggled with understanding how to use the laminar approach to calculate volume and height, and were unclear about the requirements for the assignments. Additionally, some students found the concepts of SSE, SST, and r^2 to be confusing, and would have appreciated more detailed explanations in class.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of providing clear instructions for assignments, particularly for A10 and A11, to avoid confusion and ensure students understand the requirements.
2. Offer more detailed explanations for the concepts of SSE, SST, and r^2, as these were found to be confusing by multiple students.
3. Consider providing additional support for students using Macs, as some students mentioned difficulties with using Excel on this platform.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the laminar approach to be clear and straightforward, with helpful examples and explanations.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

1. To further emphasize the specific areas of confusion, consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the topic of regression, and less on the overall clarity of the lecture. This could be achieved by starting the summary with a sentence that directly addresses the topic of regression, such as ""The students generally found the concept of regression to be clear, but some areas of confusion arose when applying it to the laminar approach.""
2. Consider breaking down the summary into two distinct paragraphs, one that highlights the clarity of the lecture on regression, and another that addresses the areas of confusion. This would provide a clearer structure and make it easier to follow.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly with regards to the laminar approach"" and instead focus on the specific concepts that students found confusing, such as SSE, SST, and r^2 values.

at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that aresimilar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work,but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail inlecture.
The difference between r squared and r
I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I’m not really sure what they are used for

SST and SSE
The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear.","Summary: Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be straightforward and clear, with many students appreciating the examples and explanations provided. However, some students struggled to understand the concept of the laminar approach and its application in assignment A10. There was also confusion regarding the use of SSE and SST, with some students finding the explanation unclear. Additionally, the difference between r and r^2 values was a point of confusion for some students.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of providing clear and concise explanations for complex concepts like the laminar approach, as many students struggled to understand its application in assignment A10. This could be achieved by providing more detailed examples and visual aids to help students grasp the concept.
2. Offer additional support for students using different operating systems, such as Mac, to ensure they can access and use the necessary tools and software, as mentioned in some reflections.
3. Provide more explicit explanations and examples to clarify the difference between SSE and SST, as well as the difference between r and r^2 values, as these concepts were a point of confusion for several students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be straightforward and clear, with many students appreciating the examples and explanations provided.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the points related to calculating pressure head and total power, as they seem to be related concepts. For example, you could rephrase the summary to focus on the specific challenges students faced in understanding how to calculate power, including pressure head and other contributing factors.
2. Some students mentioned confusion about applying the concepts to the Upper Reservoir problem, but this point is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. Consider adding a sentence to highlight this as a common area of confusion, as it may be an important aspect of the power calculation topic.
3. The summary could benefit from a clearer statement about what students found clear or easy to understand. For example, you could add a sentence to indicate that students generally found the power calculation topic clear, but with some specific areas of confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the power calculation topic clear, but some were confused about specific aspects, particularly in calculating pressure head and total power, including converting units and understanding the contributing factors. A few students also struggled to apply these concepts to the Upper Reservoir problem.

3. Consider rephrasing some of the sentences to make them more direct and to the point. For example, instead of saying ""Some students were unsure about how to gather information from stakeholders and whether they needed to generate responses themselves or gather them from others,"" you could say ""Students were unclear about how to gather information from stakeholders."" This will help to make the summary more concise and clear.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the project explanation to be confusing, particularly with regards to the scope and expectations of the assignment. Many students were unclear about what needed to be completed, including specific tasks and deliverables, and struggled to understand the problem statement and approach. Students were also unclear about how to gather information from stakeholders and navigate the assignment instructions, which were sometimes inconsistent."
156,"SUMMARY: Many students found the instructions for the in-class assignment and the project unclear, specifically Assignment 16. Some mentioned that the directions were ""somewhat confusing"" or ""relatively straightforward but slightly confusing."" The main issues were related to the breadth of the project, what was required to be turned in, and the unclear expectations from different sources, such as Brightspace and the instructor. Additionally, some students were unsure about the specific tasks and deliverables for the project, including problem scoping, stakeholder identification, and the coefficient of determination.",Instructions Unclear,"The class wasn't confusing today.

I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.

I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.

I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of. 
 I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered. 
 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.
 I thought that today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms. 
 I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could've been a could idea. 
 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations 
 I think we should've talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing. 
 I'm confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume
 Nothing
 How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models 
 Nothing was confusing

The in-class assignments and activities often caused confusion due to unclear instructions or expected outcomes. Some students felt that more explanation and examples, especially for the laminar approach and creating mathematical models in Excel, would have been helpful.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific equations and formulas that students found challenging, such as the power equation and its variables, and the pressure equation. This would provide a clearer understanding of the areas where students need more support.
2. Emphasize the need for clearer instructions and expectations for in-class assignments and activities. This could include providing more detailed explanations, examples, or visual aids to help students understand what is required.
3. Highlight the importance of providing more examples and explanations for the laminar approach and creating mathematical models in Excel, as students found this to be a particularly confusing topic.

How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models
mathematical models","SUMMARY: Students found the mathematical modeling aspects of the lecture to be challenging, particularly with understanding formulas and equations for pressure head, flow rates, and other variables. Many struggled with in-class assignments, and some found it difficult to apply mathematical models to real-world problems like the Taum Sauk project. Students were also unclear about the requirements for assignment 10, including creating mathematical models and specific calculations needed.

Suggestions:
1. Provide more detailed explanations and examples for complex equations, such as the power equation, to help students understand their application in real-world problems.
2. Offer clearer instructions and guidelines for in-class assignments, including specific details on what variables to use and how to find them, to reduce confusion and increase student understanding.
3. Provide more guidance on how to derive mathematical models from data, particularly for the laminar approach, and offer additional resources or examples to support student understanding.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the mathematical modeling aspects of the lecture challenging, particularly with understanding formulas and equations for pressure head, flow rates, and other variables.

I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of. 
 I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered. 
 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.
 I thought that today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms. 
 I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could've been a could idea. 
 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in terms of"" from the first sentence, as it is not essential to the main point being conveyed. This would make the summary more direct and to the point.
2. Consider combining the last two sentences into one, as they both convey the same idea that students struggled with understanding the laminar approach. This would make the summary more concise and easier to read.
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of laminar approach, consider removing the phrase ""and create mathematical models"" from the first sentence, as it is not specific to the laminar approach.

I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.

1. Consider breaking down the original summary into two separate paragraphs to better highlight the clarity of the lecture and the areas of confusion regarding Assignment 10. This would make the summary more concise and easier to read.

2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence ""Some students also found it challenging to find relevant information on the Taum Sauk reservoir and navigating the Purdue library and Google Scholar."" as it seems to be more related to the lecture content rather than Assignment 10.

3. Instead of using the phrase ""particularly with regards to the due dates, the breakdown of A10A and A10B, and the instructions for the mathematical and physical models,"" consider using more specific language, such as ""specifically, students were unclear about the due dates for A10, the distinction between A10A and A10B, and the requirements for the mathematical and physical models."" This would make the summary more precise and focused on the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: 

Students generally found the lecture clear and straightforward, with most expressing understanding of the material presented. However, there were areas of confusion regarding Assignment 10, specifically with regards to the due dates, the distinction between A10A and A10B, and the requirements for the mathematical and physical models.

1. To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific aspects of Gasoline Density that caused confusion, rather than stating that the majority of students found the lecture clear and straightforward. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic and its challenges. For example, the summary could state that while some students found the topic clear, others were confused about the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity.

2. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""with a few suggesting it was included to test their understanding"" to make it more concise and focused on the topic. This could be rephrased to ""some students questioned the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity, suggesting it may have been included to illustrate a concept rather than being directly applicable.""

3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the topic of Gasoline Density was well-received, but there was some confusion surrounding its application in the in-class activity and its connection to the broader environmental analysis."" This sentence does not add new information and can be implied through the previous points.","REFINED SUMMARY: While some students found the lecture on Gasoline Density clear and straightforward, others were confused about the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity, with some suggesting it may have been included to illustrate a concept rather than being directly applicable.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models

 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.

 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.

Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.

 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on clients, users, and stakeholders to be clear and straightforward, with most expressing understanding of the concepts. However, some students struggled with distinguishing between stakeholders and clients/users, and a few found it challenging to identify specific stakeholders or users for the project. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the requirements for assignment A16, particularly with regards to the submission sections and the workload. Students also expressed a desire for more guidance on how to empathize with users, especially for online students, and how to gather data for the project.

Suggestions:
1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion regarding assignment A16 requirements and the desire for more guidance on empathizing with users, into a single point. This would reduce the number of sentences and make the summary more focused.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced, rather than stating that most students found the lecture clear and straightforward. This would make the summary more accurate and relevant to the topic.
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of clients, users, and stakeholders, consider removing the mention of assignment A16 requirements, which seems to be more of a logistical issue rather than a conceptual one related to clients, users, and stakeholders.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on clients, users, and stakeholders to be clear and straightforward, with most expressing understanding of the concepts.

I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class.

 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution.

 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the specific aspect of Assignment 17 that students found most helpful, which was the clarification of expectations and understanding of evaluating pros and cons. This could be highlighted in the summary to make it more concise and focused on the topic.

2. Emphasize the common thread of surprise and realization among students when learning about the significant impact of their personal actions on climate change. This could be highlighted by rephrasing the summary to include phrases such as ""many students were surprised to learn"" or ""students were struck by the realization that their daily actions contribute significantly to climate change.""
3. Consider reorganizing the summary to group similar ideas together, such as combining the discussion on in-class activities and the use of visual aids to illustrate the effects of climate change. This could help to create a more cohesive and streamlined summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on the impact of personal carbon footprint, particularly through vehicle emissions, to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture. Many were surprised to learn about the significant contribution of their daily actions, including their cars' emissions, to climate change. The in-class activities, such as calculating their car's carbon emissions and exploring the effects of climate change through visual aids, were engaging and informative. The discussion on design trade-offs and the importance of considering environmental implications in engineering projects resonated with students, highlighting the significance of addressing climate change in their future careers as engineers."

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today

 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

To further emphasize the main point of confusion, consider rephrasing the summary to highlight the common thread among the students' concerns, which is the difficulty in understanding how to effectively test and prototype without physical materials. This would make the summary more impactful and clear.
3. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' concerns, consider adding a sentence to highlight the variety of challenges students faced, such as the struggle to determine the level of detail required for prototypes and the difficulty in testing CAD models.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible.

How to calculate environmental impact of the solar panels for a13","Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""generally found the in-class activity and carbon footprint calculations to be the most challenging aspects of the lecture"" as it is not a direct reflection of the students' responses. Instead, focus on the specific points of confusion, such as the relevance of certain values and the calculation of CO2 emissions.
2. Consider rephrasing ""how they fit into the overall analysis"" to ""how they relate to the environmental analysis"" to make the language more specific and focused on the topic of Calculations/Analysis.
3. To make the summary more accurate, consider removing the phrase ""However, many students appreciated the clear explanations of trade-offs and climate change"" as it is not a direct reflection of the students' responses. Instead, focus on the specific points of confusion and the areas where students were unclear.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the relevance of certain values, such as the density of gasoline, and the calculation of CO2 emissions, particularly in relation to the environmental analysis. Some students were unclear about how to use environmental data from A13 to reflect a carbon footprint. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the use of certain values in the in-class activity."
225,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on Gas Density to be clear and straightforward, with many stating that they did not find anything confusing. However, some students expressed difficulty in understanding the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity, with a few students feeling that it was introduced to confuse them. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the calculation of CO2 emissions, with some students seeking more detail on how to perform the calculation. Overall, the topic of Gas Density was well-received, but there is a need for further clarification on its application in the in-class activity and the calculation of CO2 emissions.",Gas Density,"in-class activity

 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it.

The ThreeSum example
threeSum analysis","SUMMARY: Students found the ThreeSum example and its analysis to be a challenging topic, with many struggling to understand how to segment the loops and calculate the individual outputs. They also had difficulty with determining the frequency of the inner loops and understanding the formal definitions of the Big O family, particularly with the concept of dropping the ""+1"" when comparing O(n) and O(n+1). Additional practice with runtime analysis and Big O functions was requested to solidify their understanding of these concepts.

Suggestions:
1. Consider breaking down the ThreeSum example into smaller, more manageable parts to help students understand the individual components and how they contribute to the overall analysis.
2. Provide more explicit explanations and examples for the concept of dropping the ""+1"" when comparing O(n) and O(n+1), as this seems to be a specific point of confusion for many students.
3. Use the students' feedback to create practice problems that focus specifically on analyzing the runtime of the ThreeSum algorithm and applying the Big O notation, to help solidify their understanding of these concepts in a more concrete way.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the ThreeSum example and its analysis particularly challenging, citing difficulties with segmenting loops, calculating individual outputs, and understanding the frequency of inner loops.

Many students were confused about how to find the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the initial velocity (V0), particularly when working with graphs and coding scenarios. Some students also found it challenging to distinguish between different assignments, such as Milestone 1 and Milestone 1a, and had difficulty understanding the requirements for each.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of clearly labeling and explaining the different assignments, such as Milestone 1 and Milestone 1a, to avoid confusion among students.
2. Provide more detailed guidance on how to find Vmax and V0, particularly when working with graphs, and consider providing examples or visual aids to support this concept.

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining the first two sentences to focus on the core idea of testing code through comparison of calculated and algorithmic values. This would eliminate the need for a separate sentence on debugging code, as it is already implied in the comparison process.
2.  The mention of ""different data structures"" could be more specific, as it is not directly related to the topic of testing code. Consider removing this point or rephrasing it to focus on how testing code applies to different data structures.
3.  The last sentence about building upon previous code could be removed, as it is not directly related to the topic of testing code. The focus should remain on the process of testing and evaluating the code, rather than its application in the project.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the practical application of testing code through comparing calculated values to those obtained from their algorithm to be an engaging and informative experience.

1. To further clarify the confusion regarding the right-hand rule, consider breaking down the specific scenarios where it is applied, such as when dealing with circular loops or multiple wires, and provide more examples to help students understand its application in different contexts.
2. To address the difficulty in setting up integrals for circular wires, provide a step-by-step guide on how to convert the circular wire into a form that can be integrated, such as using polar coordinates or converting the wire into a parametric equation.
3. To help students understand when to integrate and how to determine the bounds of integration, consider providing more examples of magnetic field problems that involve integration, and have students work through them in groups or as a class to illustrate the process and clarify any misconceptions.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed difficulty in understanding the application of integration in the context of magnetic fields, particularly when it comes to determining the direction of magnetic fields, setting up integrals, and using the right-hand rule. Many students struggled with the cross product and its application in magnetic field problems, as well as setting up integrals for circular wires. To address these challenges, the instructor can provide more detailed examples and step-by-step guides on how to apply the right-hand rule in various scenarios, such as circular loops and multiple wires. Additionally, the instructor can offer more practice problems and group work to help students understand when to integrate and how to determine the bounds of integration, ultimately solidifying their understanding of magnetic field integration."

1. To improve the summary, it would be beneficial to break down the concepts into more specific categories, such as ""Understanding Lenz's Law"", ""Interpreting Units in Circuit Problems"", and ""Applying Equations for RL Circuits"", to provide a clearer overview of the students' struggles.
2. Consider highlighting the most common points of confusion, such as the relationship between current, frequency, and oscillations, and the behavior of inductors and resistors, to provide a more focused summary.
3. To make the summary more concise, it would be helpful to eliminate redundant phrases, such as ""including"" and ""particularly"", and use more direct language to convey the students' struggles, such as ""Students struggled to understand Lenz's law"" instead of ""determining direction through Lenz's law"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand key concepts related to current, including Lenz's Law, interpreting units in circuit problems, and applying equations for RL circuits. They found it challenging to distinguish between inductor and resistor behavior, and how inductors behave in circuits. Students were also confused about the relationship between current, frequency, and oscillations, particularly in inductor-capacitor circuits."
