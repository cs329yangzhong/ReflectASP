the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.","SUMMARY: Students generally struggled with applying Ohm's Law and calculations, particularly when dealing with resistors in series and parallel circuits. Many students found it challenging to understand how to split current in a circuit, add voltage in series, and determine the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Additionally, students had difficulty understanding the concept of internal voltage of a battery versus the external voltage, and how to apply Ohm's Law in different scenarios. Some students also found it hard to distinguish between series and parallel circuits, and to understand the role of resistors in a circuit.

Suggestions:
1. To improve the summary, it would be beneficial to break down the specific areas of difficulty, such as the distinction between series and parallel circuits, and the understanding of internal and external voltage, to create a more detailed and focused summary.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the conceptual understanding of Ohm's Law and its applications, rather than just listing the difficulties students faced. This could help to highlight the key concepts that students are struggling with.

I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.","Suggestions: 

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the concept of relative motion itself, rather than its application in projectile motion. This would allow the summary to capture the core idea of relative motion and its significance in the context of the lecture. For example, the summary could start with a statement like ""Students found the concept of relative motion to be engaging and easy to understand"" and then elaborate on how it was applied in the context of projectile motion.

2. Emphasize the common thread of visual aids and interactive elements, such as videos, diagrams, and group work, that helped students understand the concept of relative motion. This would highlight the instructor's effective teaching methods and provide insight into what worked well for the students.

3. Consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students found relative motion to be a key concept in understanding projectile motion and its applications."" as it is somewhat redundant and doesn't add much to the summary. The summary already highlights the significance of relative motion in the context of projectile motion, so this sentence can be removed to make the summary more concise.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of relative motion to be engaging and easy to understand, with many appreciating the use of visual aids such as videos and diagrams to help illustrate the concept.

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.

 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly the breakout rooms"" as it is already implied that the breakout rooms are a part of the groupwork aspect. This will help to streamline the summary and focus on the main point.

2. To further emphasize the benefits of groupwork, consider adding a sentence or phrase that highlights the collaborative nature of the groupwork, such as ""Students appreciated the opportunity to work together and learn from one another"" or ""The groupwork element fostered a sense of community and teamwork among students"".

3. To make the summary more specific and focused on the topic of groupwork, consider removing the sentence ""The use of Top Hat questions and in-class assessments also kept students engaged and motivated."" This sentence is more related to the use of technology in the classroom, rather than the groupwork aspect specifically.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally enjoyed the groupwork aspect of the lecture, appreciating the interactive nature of this format, which allowed them to discuss ideas, get help from others, and work through problems together.

 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

They struggled to set up free body diagrams to account for multiple tension forces and had difficulty with problems involving multiple objects interacting with each other. Students also found it hard to visualize and understand the direction of tension forces in different scenarios, such as when a rope is pulled down on a pulley. The doubling of tension force when a rope is wrapped around a pulley was a common point of confusion.

Suggestions:

1. To better address the confusion around setting up free body diagrams for multiple tension forces, consider providing more explicit examples and step-by-step guidance on how to draw these diagrams, particularly for problems involving pulleys and ropes.
2. To help students better understand the direction of tension forces, consider using visual aids or animations to illustrate how tension forces behave in different scenarios, such as when a rope is pulled down on a pulley.
3. To clarify the concept of doubling tension force when a rope is wrapped around a pulley, consider providing a clear and concise explanation of the physics behind this phenomenon, and using simple examples to illustrate how it works.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of tension challenging, particularly in understanding why there are two tension forces in a system, such as a pulley or a rope.

1. To further clarify the concept of doubling the tension force in a pulley system, the summary could be more specific about the relationship between the tension force and the force required to pull the crate up. For example, it could be mentioned that the doubling of tension force is due to the change in direction of the force as it passes through the pulley, resulting in a component of force that is perpendicular to the direction of motion, thus requiring a greater force to overcome.

2. The summary could also delve deeper into the specific challenges students faced with setting up free body diagrams for multiple objects and forces, such as pulleys and blocks. This could include a more detailed explanation of the common pitfalls and misconceptions that students encountered, such as confusion over where to place force vectors and how to account for multiple forces acting on a single object.

3. To better capture the range of student perspectives, the summary could include more specific examples of the types of problems that caused confusion, such as the ""top hat question"" about the man holding himself up, or the problem with the three blocks.

Students generally found the lecture on Newton's Laws to be informative, with Dr. Nero's explanations being a significant help in understanding the concepts. However, there were some areas of confusion, particularly with tension forces, inertial reference frames, and the application of Newton's Laws to specific problems. Many students struggled with understanding the direction of tension forces and how they interact with other forces, as well as the concept of phantom forces in inertial reference frames. Additionally, some students found it challenging to apply Newton's Laws to complex problems, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and directions. The students appreciated the thorough explanations provided, but felt that more practice problems and examples would have been beneficial in solidifying their understanding of the material.

Suggestions:

1. To further emphasize the concept of tension forces, consider providing more examples that illustrate how tension forces interact with other forces in different directions, as several students mentioned that they found it challenging to understand the direction of tension forces.
2. To clarify the concept of inertial reference frames, consider providing more examples that demonstrate how phantom forces affect relative motion, as several students found it difficult to visualize and understand this concept.
3. To help students better apply Newton's Laws to complex problems, consider providing more practice problems that involve multiple forces and directions, as several students found it challenging to apply the laws to these types of problems.","REFINED SUMMARY:

The water question with acceleration changing suddenly","SUMMARY: Students found the concept of acceleration, particularly in relation to terminal velocity and drag force, to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture. Many appreciated the real-life examples, such as the skier and pendulum free body diagrams, and the calculation of acceleration experienced when hitting water at terminal velocity. The idea that acceleration can occur even when velocity is constant was also a point of fascination. Additionally, the explanation of centripetal force and its application in uniform circular motion was well-received, with students enjoying the opportunity to relate it to conceptual ideas and real-life scenarios.

Suggestions:
1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two main points about real-life examples and the calculation of acceleration. For example, ""Many appreciated the real-life examples, such as the skier and pendulum free body diagrams, which helped illustrate the calculation of acceleration experienced when hitting water at terminal velocity.""
2. Emphasize the common thread of ""constant velocity"" in the students' reflections, as it seems to be a concept that resonated with many students. For example, ""The idea that acceleration can occur even when velocity is constant was a point of fascination, as seen in the examples of terminal velocity and uniform circular motion.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""well-received"" as it is somewhat subjective and not directly related to the topic of acceleration. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of centripetal force that students found interesting, such as its application in uniform circular motion and its relation to conceptual ideas.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of acceleration, particularly in relation to terminal velocity and drag force, to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture.

Students generally found the explanations of dot and cross products to be informative and helpful, with practice problems clarifying the topics. However, there were some areas of confusion, particularly with the right-hand rule and its application in determining the direction of vectors. Many students found it challenging to understand how to visualize the right-hand rule on a 2D graph and when it would be considered left-handed. Additionally, some students were unclear about the direction of the result when using the cross product and how to determine if the answer is positive or negative. Some students also found it difficult to understand the relationship between displacement, velocity, and acceleration graphs, and would benefit from more in-depth explanations and examples.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the right-hand rule by providing more visual aids and examples to help students understand its application on a 2D graph, including when it would be considered left-handed.
2. Provide more explicit explanations and examples on how to determine the direction of the result when using the cross product, including how to determine if the answer is positive or negative.

To make the summary more focused on the topic of General TopHat Issues, consider removing sentences that discuss topics that are not directly related to the TopHat, such as the desire for more practice on position, velocity, and acceleration graphs, or the derivation of formulas for acceleration and velocity.

Students generally found the concept of using kinematic equations to solve problems involving relative motion to be a challenging topic, particularly when it comes to determining which equation to use in specific situations. The dinosaur example, which involved two objects moving in different directions, was a common point of confusion, with some students struggling to understand how to handle the relative motion and direction of acceleration. Additionally, the distinction between average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration was also a source of confusion for many students. Some students also found it difficult to apply the right-hand rule and understand the concept of negative and positive values in kinematic equations. Overall, students benefited from the practice problems and explanations provided in class, but many still require further practice and review to solidify their understanding of the material.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the context of each problem to determine which kinematic equation to use, as many students struggled with this aspect. This could be achieved by providing more examples that illustrate the application of different equations in various scenarios.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to handle relative motion and direction of acceleration, as seen in the dinosaur example, to help students better understand how to approach these types of problems.
3. Offer additional practice problems that focus on applying the right-hand rule and understanding the concept of negative and positive values in kinematic equations, as these were areas of confusion for many students.","REFINED SUMMARY:

I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

top hat
I found the fact that forces had resisting components interesting. 
drawing free body diagrams to set up equations
I found the fact that it became 2T interesting when he pulled himself up.
The “recipe” for free body diagrams. It made drawing them a lot easier.
I found it most interesting that to hold yourself still while on a pulley system, you only need to apply the force of half your weight. 
Today, I found the conceptual problem with the man pulling up with a velocity the most interesting. If you had done the problem in your mind, then you would have gotten twice the answer. 
 The pulley system/elevator problems because I find them very fun to do.
 I found the top hat questions about normal force to be most interesting 
 Top hat question where the man on the chair pulls on the rope. I thought it was an interesting real life problem to solve.
 The part that I found most interesting about today's lecture was the conceptual questions because they were tricky.
 I found the first example with the man in the chair the most interesting.  The fact that he only has to pull with half the force of gravity was intriguing. 
 free body diagrams

 I thought learning how to draw free body diagrams was interesting. I also thought that learning about how the axes can be rotated so that more of the forces line up with them was really useful and interesting.

 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?

 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions

 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex free body diagrams. Many students struggled with understanding how to combine forces and create equations for systems with multiple blocks, citing difficulties with the last top hat question as a common source of confusion. Some students also found it hard to determine the correct type of friction to use and how to apply it in different scenarios. Additionally, a few students were unsure about the concept of the coefficient of friction and its relationship to the normal force. However, most students appreciated the interactive lectures and found them helpful in boosting their confidence in solving force problems.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the importance of labeling and identifying forces in free body diagrams, as many students struggled with determining the correct type and direction of forces in complex systems.
2. Provide more examples of how to break down complex problems into simpler systems, as students found it difficult to understand how to combine forces and create equations for systems with multiple blocks.
3. Offer more detailed explanations of the coefficient of friction and its relationship to the normal force, as some students were unsure about this concept and its application in different scenarios.","REFINED SUMMARY:

 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun.

 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.

 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero

 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g’s tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I wasconfused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variableswould end up cancelling.
The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first.
I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","Suggestions:

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when dealing with the transition from air to water"" as it is not a major point that is consistently mentioned across the reflections. The main issue with terminal velocity seems to be the understanding of the drag force and its impact on the concept.
2.  The summary could be more focused on the specific challenges students faced with terminal velocity, such as setting up the equation and understanding the application of multiple g's. This would make the summary more relevant to the topic and avoid mentioning other related concepts like drag force that are not directly related to terminal velocity.
3.  Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students also found it difficult to conceptualize the drag force problems and connect them to real-life scenarios"" to ""Some students struggled with understanding the drag force formula and its components, and the units associated with it"" to make it more specific to the topic of terminal velocity.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of terminal velocity challenging, particularly when setting up the equation and understanding the application of multiple g's.

106,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of metrics to be somewhat clear, but had difficulties in understanding how to apply it in the context of the weighted decision matrix (WDM) and the in-class activity. Many students were confused about the distinction between criteria and metrics, with some struggling to understand how to choose and assign numerical values to metrics. Additionally, some students found it challenging to determine the specific numbers for the metrics and how to describe the scores for the criteria.

2. Consider highlighting the students' comments on the importance of learning from each other's perspectives, as it was a recurring theme throughout the reflections. For example, ""Students valued the opportunity to learn from their peers' insights and perspectives, which added depth to their understanding of the topic.""
3. Remove the phrase ""Overall, the interactive nature of the lecture facilitated meaningful exchanges of information and ideas among students."" as it is a general statement that doesn't add much to the summary. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of the lecture that facilitated effective communication and collaboration among students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the hands-on experience of analyzing data in Excel to be a highlight of the lecture, particularly when it came to understanding the bike share project's data collection and tracking capabilities. The breakout rooms and group discussions enabled students to engage in meaningful exchanges of information and ideas, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Many students appreciated the opportunity to learn from their peers' insights and perspectives, which added depth to their understanding of the topic. The discussion on problem statements and the design and scoping cycle also sparked interest, as it was a new concept for some students."

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have beencovered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculationsfor energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculationsin.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about assignment 13 and the different types of energy units, into a single point. This will help to reduce repetition and make the summary more focused on the topic.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific aspects of Energy Calculations and Units that students found confusing, rather than the overall clarity of the lecture. This will help to provide a more detailed understanding of the areas where students struggled.
3. To make the summary more specific, consider including more details about the types of energy units that students found confusing, such as the difference between kWh and kW, or the conversion between different units of energy. This will help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the specific challenges students faced.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be straightforward and clear, with most expressing that they had a good understanding of the material. However, some students struggled with understanding the different types of energy units, particularly the conversion between them, and the specific requirements for assignment 13, including the economic aspect and the constraints and criteria. Additionally, some students found it challenging to understand the concept of constraints and criteria in the assignment."
123,"SUMMARY: Many students found the lecture on Assignment 13 clear and straightforward, with some expressing appreciation for the instructor's explanations. However, some students found the calculation of payback periods and capital investment to be confusing, particularly the equation and the inclusion of certain numbers. Additionally, there were some difficulties with the environmental impact section, specifically with determining CO2 emissions and natural gas usage. Some students also expressed uncertainty about the requirements and data needed for the assignment.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing 
The applications of payback periods and capital investment could have been covered more.
There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.

1.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two main points of confusion (numbers discrepancy and conversion process) into a single sentence. This would help to streamline the information and make it easier to read.

2.  To further emphasize the main issue, consider rephrasing the summary to focus on the specific aspect of the CO2 Emission Calculations that caused the most confusion, which is the discrepancy between the numbers presented in the PowerPoint slides and the Brightspace slides.

3.  To provide a more balanced view, consider adding a sentence to acknowledge that despite the initial confusion, most students were able to complete the in-class activity with the help of their peers and the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the CO2 Emission Calculations to be the most confusing aspect of the lecture, specifically due to discrepancies between the numbers presented in the PowerPoint slides and the Brightspace slides, which caused confusion during the in-class activity.

I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.

 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!!

Some students also questioned the purpose of the ""engineer in 2030"" drawing activity and requested more information on upcoming assignments and project details.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific areas of confusion, such as Brightspace organization and the BikeShare project, rather than stating that the lecture was ""clear and straightforward"" in general. This will make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of HW and Project Directions/Instruction.

 Nothing stood out as it was mostly group work.
 Using math in class is getting interesting, more than just finding means, now we are using slope and instantaneous rate
 I liked getting to work in the breakout rooms, I feel like my team has a good understanding on the a12 assignment
 The most interest part of today's class was learning about the volumetric flow rate and how to calculate it of multiple intervals.
 I found it interesting how we are taking the slope and are going to change its units to get different values of Q.
 I liked how we talked about voting, bought awareness to it and I now know I can use my Purdue ID card.
 I liked that we got so much time to work with our team in class. It helped to get all of us on the same page.
 I thought that the fact that a12 was a continuation of a10 was interesting.
 Getting a good start on A12
 I was sent to the wrong break room and met new people so that was interesting. 
 There was not a whole lot of new information in this class besides information about assessments and assignments
 I found the instant volumetric flowrate calculations to be most interesting as I like calculus.
 I found working with my team most interesting.
 Nothing 
 Working on the project was interesting
 We spent the whole class time in breakout groups working on A12. It seems as though classes are starting to mean that way.

Learning about the project was interesting","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating repetitive phrases. For example, the phrase ""found the in-class work on the project to be the most engaging and interesting part of the lecture"" is repeated in several reflections, so it could be condensed into a single sentence.
2. Emphasize the specific aspects of the project that students found most interesting, such as problem scoping, stakeholders, and the design process. This will help to create a clearer picture of what aspects of the project resonated with the students.
3. Consider highlighting the unique aspect of the project, which is its relevance to campus life and the students' own experiences. This could be emphasized more in the summary to show how the project is not just an academic exercise, but a real-world problem that students can relate to and feel invested in solving.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the project to be the most engaging part of the lecture, particularly enjoying the in-class work with their groups, exploring different methods and processes for making decisions, and learning about problem scoping from various perspectives. Many students found the discussions on stakeholders, users, and the design process to be particularly interesting, appreciating the project's flexibility and relevance to campus life. The fact that the project allows them to apply skills learned throughout the semester to create a solution that could improve campus mobility generated excitement, making it a more engaging and challenging assignment compared to previous ones."
138,"SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process to be the most interesting part of the lecture, as it allowed them to view the problem from various perspectives and consider the needs of different stakeholders and users. They appreciated the hands-on experience of working in groups to generate ideas and develop a deeper understanding of the problem statement. Many students also enjoyed the flexibility and freedom of the new project, which allows them to design their own solutions to a real-world problem relevant to their campus community.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider condensing the information into two or three main points. For example, the first point could focus on the students' appreciation for the problem scoping process, the second point could highlight the hands-on experience of working in groups, and the third point could emphasize the students' enthusiasm for the project's flexibility and relevance to their campus community.
2. To further emphasize the topic of problem scoping, consider removing sentences that mention the project's flexibility and freedom, as they are more related to the overall project rather than the specific topic of problem scoping. This would allow the summary to focus more on the students' reflections on the problem scoping process itself.
3. Consider adding more specific language from the students' reflections to support the points made in the summary. For example, you could include phrases such as ""viewing the problem from a variety of perspectives"" or ""considering the needs of different stakeholders and users"" to provide more concrete examples of the students' understanding of problem scoping.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process to be the most interesting part of the lecture, as it allowed them to view the problem from various perspectives and consider the needs of different stakeholders and users. They appreciated the hands-on experience of working in groups to generate ideas and develop a deeper understanding of the problem statement. By considering multiple viewpoints and user needs, students gained a better grasp of the problem, as reflected in their comments about ""viewing the problem from a variety of perspectives"" and ""considering the needs of different stakeholders and users."" This experience has prepared them well for the upcoming project, which will challenge them to apply their skills to a real-world problem relevant to their campus community."

1. Remove the phrase ""Many were interested in creating a video presentation"" as it is a general statement and not directly supported by the reflections. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of the project presentation that students found engaging, such as ""creating a video presentation to communicate their solutions"" and ""working in breakout rooms with their teams"".
2. Consider rephrasing ""Some students enjoyed the hands-on experience of working on the practice exam and creating 3D models of their final solutions"" to ""Students appreciated the hands-on experience of working on the practice exam and creating 3D models, which added to their excitement about presenting their project"".
3. Remove the phrase ""indicating that this aspect of the lecture was a highlight for many"" as it is a conclusion that can be inferred from the reflections, but not directly supported by them. The summary should focus on summarizing the reflections rather than making inferences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the project presentation aspect of the lecture engaging, particularly the opportunity to create a video presentation to communicate their solutions for the unit project.

Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

However, there was a lack of clarity on the specific application of the Laminar Approach to assignment A10, with many students expressing confusion on how to use it to calculate volume and height. Some students also found it challenging to understand the concept of the Laminar Approach itself, and how it relates to the assignment. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the use of statistical measures such as SSE, SST, and r^2, with some students expressing a need for more detailed explanations.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the connection between the Laminar Approach and assignment A10 by providing more explicit instructions or examples on how to apply the concept to the assignment. This could help alleviate confusion and ensure students understand how to use the Laminar Approach to calculate volume and height.
2. Provide more detailed explanations of the statistical measures SSE, SST, and r^2, including their definitions and practical applications. This could help students better understand the concepts and how they relate to the Laminar Approach.
3. Consider providing additional visual aids or examples to help students understand the concept of the Laminar Approach and its relationship to the assignment. This could include diagrams, charts, or other visual representations that illustrate the concept and make it more concrete for students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on the Laminar Approach to be straightforward, with clear examples and explanations provided.

 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.
 when assignment a11 is due and what our in class quiz is on
 SST and SSE

 I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear. ",207,"The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that aresimilar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.

However, some students expressed confusion about the concept of the laminar approach and its application in assignments A10 and A11. Additionally, a few students struggled to understand the differences between SSE, SST, and r^2, and how to calculate and interpret these values. Some students also mentioned that more explanation and clarification on these topics would be beneficial to alleviate confusion and ensure a deeper understanding.

Suggestions: 

1. Emphasize the importance of providing clear and concise explanations for the laminar approach, as many students found it confusing and struggled to understand its application in assignments. This could be achieved by providing more detailed examples and visual aids to help students grasp the concept.
2. Offer additional clarification on the differences between SSE, SST, and r^2, as several students struggled to understand these concepts. This could be done through further explanation and examples in class, or by providing additional resources for students to review outside of class.
3. Consider providing more explicit guidance on how to calculate and interpret these values, as some students mentioned that they were unsure about how to do so. This could be achieved through step-by-step examples in class, or by providing additional practice problems for students to work on outside of class.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be clear and understandable, with many stating that the examples and explanations provided were helpful.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about Assignment 16 and the project scope, into a single sentence or phrase. This would help to condense the information and make it easier to read.
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence ""However, a few students found the explanation clear and were able to understand the project requirements after clarification from the instructor or TA."" This sentence is not directly related to the confusion about the project and seems out of place in the summary.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific aspects of the project that caused confusion, such as the problem statement, stakeholder information, and project scope, rather than making a general statement about the explanation being confusing.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.

Consider adding a sentence to highlight this, such as ""Students particularly appreciated the clear explanation of the course structure, which helped them understand the main projects and group work expectations.""
2. Consider removing the phrase ""Overall, the students felt that the class logistics were well-organized and provided a good foundation for the course."" as it's a bit generic and doesn't add much to the summary. The summary already conveys a positive tone, so this sentence doesn't add much value.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""The students also enjoyed the opportunity to learn about the different branches of engineering and the variety of advisors available for assistance."" to make it more concise and focused on the logistics aspect. For example, ""Students also appreciated the variety of advisors available for assistance, which added to the clarity of the course logistics.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the class logistics to be engaging and interactive, particularly the breakout rooms, which allowed them to meet and interact with their peers. Many appreciated the clarity provided on the course structure, including the main projects and the CATME system for group work. Students particularly appreciated the clear explanation of the course structure, which helped them understand the main projects and group work expectations. The use of technology, such as Zoom breakout rooms, was seen as a valuable tool for facilitating group discussions and teamwork. Students also appreciated the variety of advisors available for assistance, which added to the clarity of the course logistics."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider condensing the information by removing repetitive phrases such as ""I found it interesting"" and focusing on the main points. For example, instead of saying ""I found it interesting how we compared the different coffee machines"" and ""I found it interesting comparing a french press and a keurig"", you could say ""Students appreciated the hands-on comparison of different coffee makers, including a french press and a keurig, which helped them understand the pros and cons of each.""
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing sentences that are not directly related to the Pros and Cons Activity, such as ""A lot of the information that goes into consumer/pedestrian usage of signage and warnings is interesting."" This sentence seems to be a tangent and doesn't contribute to the discussion of the Pros and Cons Activity.
3. To make the summary more cohesive, consider reorganizing the sentences to group similar ideas together. For example, you could group the sentences about biomimicry together and the sentences about the hands-on experience of brainstorming and listing pros and cons together. This would make the summary easier to follow and more focused on the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the Pros and Cons Activity engaging and informative, particularly in applying it to real-life scenarios such as evaluating the pros and cons of different coffee makers and consumer products. The hands-on experience of brainstorming and listing pros and cons in class helped students understand the importance of weighing advantages and disadvantages in decision-making. Many students appreciated the comparison of different coffee makers, including a french press and a keurig, which highlighted the pros and cons of each. The activity also sparked interest in biomimicry, with some students finding it fascinating to explore how nature-inspired solutions can be applied to design problems, such as learning about how elephants create pathways in the jungle.

 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.

The changes made to correct engineering failures","SUMMARY: Students found the topic of engineering failures to be engaging and thought-provoking, with many expressing interest in the real-world examples and case studies presented in class. The Taum Sauk reservoir failure was a particularly compelling example, with students noting the importance of ethics, proper design, and attention to detail in preventing such disasters. Many students appreciated the opportunity to work in groups and analyze the causes of engineering failures, highlighting the significance of good communication, documentation, and considering multiple perspectives. The discussion also sparked reflection on the potential consequences of negligence and the importance of learning from past mistakes to improve future engineering practices.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the common thread of negligence and ethics in engineering failures: Many students mentioned the importance of ethics and proper design in preventing engineering failures, but it would be beneficial to highlight this as a recurring theme throughout the discussion, rather than just mentioning it in relation to the Taum Sauk reservoir failure.
2. Highlight the significance of group work in understanding engineering failures: Students consistently mentioned the value of working in groups to analyze the causes of engineering failures, which suggests that this aspect of the lesson was particularly effective. Emphasizing this in the summary could help to reinforce the importance of collaborative learning.
3. Use more specific language to describe the consequences of engineering failures: While the summary mentions the ""potential consequences of negligence,"" it would be more impactful to use more specific language, such as ""devastating environmental damage,"" ""loss of human life,"" or ""economic collapse,"" to convey the severity of the consequences of engineering failures.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the topic of engineering failures to be engaging and thought-provoking, with many expressing interest in the real-world examples and case studies presented in class.

179,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear, but had difficulty with Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. The main areas of confusion included the instructions for Assignment 10, particularly the mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach, as well as the expectations for peer-reviewed sources and citations. Some students also struggled with understanding the technical brief for the Taum Sauk upper reservoir project and the requirements for the in-class activity. Additionally, students felt that the instructions for Assignment 10 were unclear, and that more time was needed to complete the in-class activity.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information.

Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear, but had difficulty with Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. The main areas of confusion included the instructions for Assignment 10, particularly the mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach, as well as the expectations for peer-reviewed sources and citations. Some students also struggled with understanding the technical brief for the Taum Sauk upper reservoir project and the requirements for the in-class activity. Additionally, students felt that the instructions for Assignment 10 were unclear, and that more time was needed to complete the in-class activity.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, it would be helpful to break down the main areas of confusion into more specific points, such as ""mathematical modeling,"" ""Laminar Approach,"" ""peer-reviewed sources,"" and ""citations,"" and provide a brief explanation of each. This would make the summary more concise and easier to follow.
2. Consider removing the phrase ""students generally found the lecture clear"" as it contradicts the main point of the summary, which is that students had difficulty with Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. This phrase could be replaced with a more neutral statement, such as ""students had mixed reactions to the lecture.""
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence ""Some students also struggled with understanding the technical brief for the Taum Sauk upper reservoir project and the requirements for the in-class activity."" This sentence seems to be a non-sequitur and distracts from the main point of the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had difficulty with Assignment 10 and the in-class activity, citing confusion with the instructions, particularly the mathematical modeling and Laminar Approach. They also struggled with understanding the expectations for peer-reviewed sources and citations. Additionally, students found the instructions for Assignment 10 unclear, and many felt that more time was needed to complete the in-class activity."

 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about Assignment 10's instructions and the Laminar Approach, into a single sentence. This would help to streamline the summary and focus on the main issues.

2. To further focus the summary on the topic of Due Dates or Deliverables, consider removing sentences that mention the in-class activity or other aspects of the lecture that are not directly related to due dates or deliverables. This would help to ensure that the summary stays on topic and does not include unnecessary information.

3. To make the summary more specific and actionable, consider rephrasing it to focus on the specific changes that could be made to improve the clarity of due dates and deliverables. For example, instead of saying ""students would benefit from clearer explanations and more detailed instructions,"" consider saying ""clearer instructions for Assignment 10, including more detailed explanations of the Laminar Approach and acceptable sources, would be beneficial."" This would help to provide a clear direction for improvement.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the clarity of due dates and deliverables, particularly for Assignment 10, citing unclear instructions for mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach. Clearer instructions for A10, including more detailed explanations of the Laminar Approach and acceptable sources, would be beneficial. Additionally, some students were unsure about the degree of reliability required for sources, highlighting the need for more guidance on this topic."

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.

 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.

 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.

 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.

 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes).

Many students also found the assignments, particularly Assignment 8, to be confusing due to a lack of clear instructions and explanations. Some students felt that more practice and examples would be beneficial in understanding probability and z-scores. Additionally, there were questions about the use of Excel, particularly in handling missing data and converting data types.

Suggestions:
1. To improve the clarity of the summary, consider highlighting the specific areas where students struggled the most, such as the z-score and its application, and the confusion surrounding Assignment 8. This will help identify the most critical areas that need improvement.
2. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly Assignment 8"" and instead focus on the general theme of confusion surrounding the assignments. This will help to avoid giving the impression that only Assignment 8 was problematic.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students felt that more practice and examples would be beneficial in understanding probability and z-scores"" to ""Students felt that more practice and examples would be beneficial in understanding probability and z-scores"" to make it more concise and clear.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Statistics and Probability to be clear, but some struggled with specific concepts such as the z-score, its calculation, and its application in finding the area under a curve.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class

 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider focusing on the most common themes and ideas mentioned by the students, rather than trying to include every single comment. For example, the summary could focus on the students' appreciation for the interactive aspects of the class, their interest in biomimicry, and their enthusiasm for learning about idea generation methods.
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Idea Generation and Brainstorming, consider removing comments that are not directly related to this topic, such as the mention of the quiz being over or the excitement about A16 not being part 4. This will help to keep the summary on track and avoid diluting the main message.
3. To make the summary more specific and detailed, consider using quotes or paraphrasing specific comments from the students to illustrate their points. For example, the summary could mention that one student found the idea of using nature as a source of inspiration for solutions to be ""a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem."" This will help to add depth and specificity to the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: The students found the topic of idea generation and brainstorming to be engaging and relevant to their learning, particularly through interactive aspects such as breakout group time and the use of biomimicry.

 We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
 How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
 Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.
 Nothing was confusing to me in class today.
 There wasn't much confusion with today's lecture. I thought our module quiz was so much easier to comprehend than the last one and make class easy to move through 
 I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
 The length of the time periods
 I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day. 
 The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
 My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn't.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?
 The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough

 There was nothing particularly confusing with today's class. The thing that needed more details was the use of the excel file to find the flow rate. 
 Everything was clear and well explained in today's class
 I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
 It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use 
 Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
 How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.

What we needed to do in part 6.a and 6.b","Suggestions: 

1. Consider combining the points about Assignment 12 and its related issues into a single sentence, as they are closely related and can be condensed. For example, ""Students had some confusion regarding Assignment 12, particularly Part 6, including the selection of time intervals, the use of linear equations for modeling, and the calculation of volumetric flow rate, as well as unclear expectations and difficulties with submission.""
2. Emphasize the common thread of confusion related to the practical application of concepts, such as the calculation of volumetric flow rate and the use of linear equations, rather than listing individual points. This can help to create a clearer and more concise summary.
3. Consider removing the phrase ""most expressing that they were not confused about the material presented"" as it contradicts the points that follow, which highlight specific areas of confusion. This can help to create a more accurate and focused summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture straightforward, but had some confusion regarding Assignment 12, particularly Part 6, including the selection of time intervals, the use of linear equations for modeling, and the calculation of volumetric flow rate, as well as unclear expectations and difficulties with submission."

Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing 
 For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation) 
 I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
 The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.

1.  Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific aspect of trade-offs, rather than the broader topic of environmental impact. This would help to maintain a clear focus on the topic and avoid diluting the summary with unrelated information. For example, ""Students found the concept of trade-offs, particularly in the context of design and environmental considerations, to be a fascinating and thought-provoking topic.""
2.  Emphasize the connection between the trade-offs concept and the students' future careers as engineers. This would help to highlight the relevance of the topic to their studies and make the summary more engaging. For example, ""The idea of balancing competing factors, such as environmental concerns and design requirements, resonated with students, who recognized the importance of considering these trade-offs in their future careers as engineers and the impact of their designs on the world around them.""
3.  Consider removing the phrase ""hands-on activity of calculating their car's carbon emissions"" and instead focus on the concept of trade-offs itself. This would help to maintain a clear focus on the topic and avoid diluting the summary with unrelated information.

How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Criteria and Constraints/Stakeholders to be straightforward and easy to follow, with most students understanding the material well. However, some students expressed confusion regarding the distinction between criteria and constraints, with some finding it challenging to determine how to account for unstated client criteria. Additionally, several students were unclear about the requirements for assignment A16, specifically the sections that were due and the amount of work expected in a short timeframe. Some students also found it difficult to identify users and clients, and a few students were unsure about how to empathize with different users, particularly those who are online students.

Suggestions:
1. To further clarify the distinction between criteria and constraints, consider providing more explicit examples or case studies that illustrate the differences between the two, and how to account for unstated client criteria.
2. To address the confusion regarding assignment A16, provide clear and consistent instructions on the Brightspace page, and consider breaking down the assignment into smaller, more manageable tasks to help students understand the workload and deadlines.
3. To help students better understand how to identify users and clients, and empathize with different users, consider providing more guidance on how to conduct user research and gather data, particularly for online students who may not have access to on-campus resources.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Criteria and Constraints/Stakeholders to be straightforward and easy to follow, with most students understanding the material well.

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible.

 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.

 I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable.",418,"The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation’s other than to try to trip us up.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on gas density to be clear and straightforward, with most students stating that they did not find anything confusing. However, a few students mentioned that they were unsure about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity, and some found the carbon footprint information to be confusing due to unclear connections to the environmental data from A13. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the calculation of CO2 emissions, with some students expressing a need for more detail on this topic.

Suggestions:
1. Clarify the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity to avoid confusion among students, as some students questioned its connection to the topic.
2. Provide more detail on the calculation of CO2 emissions, as some students found this topic confusing and requested more explanation.
3. Ensure a clear connection between the carbon footprint information and the environmental data from A13 to avoid confusion among students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on gas density to be clear and straightforward, with most students stating that they did not find anything confusing. However, some students expressed uncertainty about the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity, and a few found the carbon footprint information confusing due to unclear connections to the environmental data from A13. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the calculation of CO2 emissions, with some students requesting more detail on this topic. To improve future lectures, it is recommended that the instructor clarify the connection between gas density and the in-class activity, provide more detailed explanations on CO2 emissions, and ensure a clear link between the carbon footprint information and the environmental data from A13."

Something interesting was the quiz in class, I enjoyed it and think I did well. 
I liked learning about all the ways to create ideas in your head. 
It was interesting to finish the quiz and get it over with.
Nothing was that interesting in today's class. The topics discussed were neutral.
The breakout group time we had to work with out groups 
I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions 
What I found most interesting about today's class was how much processing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used to create a solution. 
I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
 I enjoyed the class it really is starting to seem like we are learning stuff that is going to be very important to us. I was also very excited to learn that A16 was not part 4 like we thought
 Learning about different types of problem solving

Idea generation with my team","Suggestions:

1. **Emphasize the connection between brainstorming and problem-solving**: The original summary does a good job of highlighting the students' interest in brainstorming and idea generation, but it could be strengthened by explicitly stating how these concepts are used to solve real-world problems. This could be achieved by adding a sentence or two to emphasize the practical applications of brainstorming and idea generation.
2. **Remove repetitive phrases and focus on unique insights**: Some students mention similar points, such as the interest in biomimicry and idea generation. To make the summary more concise, consider removing repetitive phrases and focusing on unique insights or perspectives that add depth to the discussion.
3. **Use more specific language to describe the brainstorming process**: While the summary mentions ""brainstorming and idea generation,"" it could be more specific about the techniques and approaches used in class, such as the use of different problem-solving methods or the importance of iteration. This would provide a clearer picture of what students learned and how they can apply it to their own work.","REFINED SUMMARY:

Students found the brainstorming and idea generation process to be a fascinating aspect of the lecture, particularly when applied to real-world problems and solutions. The concept of biomimicry, where nature's designs and adaptations are used to inspire innovative solutions, sparked their interest. Students appreciated the hands-on experience of brainstorming in breakout groups, where they utilized various techniques for generating ideas, such as different approaches to problem-solving and the utilization of public information like patents. The class also emphasized the importance of iteration and iteration studio time, where students started working on their design project, sparking their interest in the practical applications of the concepts learned. By applying these techniques, students gained a deeper understanding of how to tackle complex problems and create effective solutions."

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing repetitive phrases such as ""I found it interesting"" or ""I found the project interesting"" and focus on the specific aspects of the design project that students found engaging. For example, instead of ""I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are,"" the summary could focus on the specific aspect of safety measures and how students appreciated the relevance of the project to their own experiences.
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing sentences that do not directly relate to the design project or problem scoping. For example, the sentence ""There wasn't anything very interesting today, maybe a different approach to the project explanation could help engage students"" does not provide any insight into the design project and can be removed.
3. To make the summary more cohesive, consider grouping similar ideas together. For example, the summary could be organized into sections that focus on the students' understanding of problem scoping, their appreciation for the relevance of the project, and their excitement to apply their knowledge to the new project. This would help to create a more organized and clear summary.","REFINED SUMMARY:

binary tree","SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on binary trees to be challenging, particularly with regards to the implementation of the BinaryNode class and the concept of deep vs shallow copying. Some students were also confused about the constructor for the binary tree class and the usage of BinaryNode objects in the BinaryTree implementation. Additionally, there was confusion about the representation of data in BinaryNode objects, specifically whether it is a reference or not. Furthermore, students were unclear about the purpose of certain methods and had difficulty following the explanation of copying a binary tree.

Students generally found the concept of strong induction challenging to grasp, particularly in determining the number of base cases and making a plan. Many students were unsure about the difference between strong and weak induction, with some questioning the naming of the methods if they are not more powerful. Additionally, students struggled with the abstract nature of strong induction and the process of applying it, feeling that a step was missing in the process. Some students were also unsure about how to choose between strong and weak induction, and when to use each method. Overall, students found it difficult to apply strong induction to problems, with some feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the concept."
