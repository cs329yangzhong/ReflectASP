Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero.

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief.

Consider incorporating more opportunities for students to reflect on their own learning and group dynamics, as some students mentioned the value of self-assessment and peer feedback in the groupwork process.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students valued the groupwork aspect of the lecture, particularly breakout rooms, which fostered collaboration, discussion, and peer-to-peer help. This format kept them engaged, promoted active learning, and helped them grasp the material, especially when solving problems. Effective communication, diverse perspectives, and peer feedback were key to their success in groupwork."
53,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the in-class problems engaging and interactive, particularly the use of breakout rooms for group work and the Top Hat questions. Many appreciated the hands-on practice and the opportunity to discuss and learn from their peers. The format allowed for a deeper understanding of concepts, such as vector addition and subtraction, and the application of trigonometry in vector problems.",In-Class Problems,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

56,"SUMMARY: Students found the man and pulley example to be a challenging concept, particularly in understanding the two tension forces involved and how they relate to the forces acting on the man. Many students struggled to visualize the free body diagram and the resulting equations, with some questioning why the tension force is doubled when the rope is pulled down on the pulley.",Man and Pulley Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
How you could put more than one object in a system 
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
 I was confused about the free body diagrams. 
 The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
 The part that was confusing about today's lecture was the problem with the three blocks. I didn't know how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram for that.
 Some of the free body diagrams, such as the one with the ice blocks, still are not clear to me
 pulleys
 I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times.  This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
 doubling the force of tension

61,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of coefficient of friction to be a key takeaway from the lecture, with many highlighting its relationship to normal force and its varying values depending on the surface and material. The idea that surface area does not affect friction, but rather the coefficient of friction does, was also a point of interest. Additionally, students enjoyed applying the concept to real-life scenarios, such as the sandpaper block example, and appreciated the interactive nature of the top hat questions that helped solidify their understanding of the concept.",Coefficient of Friction,"I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level.

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?

What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting

It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.

 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product

 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth

 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.

 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me

 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer

 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution

:    The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up","SUMMARY: Students found the last question of the lecture, which involved two blocks with friction, to be the most confusing part of the class. Many struggled with understanding how to combine the two blocks into one system, how to determine the forces acting on each block, and how to apply the concept of friction to the problem. Some students also found it challenging to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to use the coefficient of friction in calculations.

Suggestions:
1. Consider adding more specific examples of how to break down complex problems into simpler systems, such as the two-block problem, to help students understand how to approach these types of problems.
2. Emphasize the importance of clearly labeling and distinguishing between static and kinetic friction in free body diagrams to avoid confusion.
3. Provide more explicit guidance on how to use the coefficient of friction in calculations, including how to apply it to different types of friction (static and kinetic) and how to determine the normal force in complex scenarios.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the last question of the lecture, involving two blocks with friction, to be the most challenging.

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly its uniformity throughout a rope"" as it is a supporting detail that can be implied by the concept of tension. This would make the summary more focused on the main idea of students' interest in tension and its applications.
2. The summary could be improved by highlighting the variety of examples and scenarios that students found interesting, rather than just listing ""scenarios such as tug-of-war and the top hat problem."" Consider condensing this into a more general statement, such as ""real-world applications in various scenarios.""
3. To emphasize the connection between the lecture and students' understanding of Newton's Laws, consider rephrasing the last sentence to focus more on how the lecture helped solidify their understanding, rather than just stating that the examples helped. For example, ""The lecture helped students solidify their understanding of Newton's Laws by applying theoretical concepts to practical problem-solving.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of tension to be a highlight of the lecture, appreciating its real-world applications in various scenarios.

 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.

 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

The detailed projects that make up the class
I thought that the data collected in excel was interesting. I found that it was cool that the company was able to track and see how long each individual rider rode the bike.
I didn't think much was interesting, but I would have liked to hear more about the Problem Statement.
I had never heard of problem statements so that was interesting to learn.
Getting to roughly examine the file and analyze their data
I found the design and scoping cycle/process to be the most interesting because it will be an integral part of this class and in a future career.
I found learning about how to write a problem statement the most important and most interesting today.  I also found learning about excel to be interesting.
I found it really interesting how much data was collected from the bikes, and how much information you can track down from one excel file.
I was interested in how much data was collected by bike share. It seemed like they had a lot of information.
Proble scoping
 I really liked how we were able to use excel and import data from online into an excel sheet and therefore analyze the data and make statements based on what we saw. 
 I find the bike share project very interesting. 
 The bike data
 Looking through the CoGo data on Excel and analyzing trends was very interesting.
 The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
 The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
 the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
 I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
 I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
 The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
 Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups 
 I liked doing the complex calculations in excel 
 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly when importing data from online sources"" as it is not a crucial point and can be implied by the phrase ""hands-on experience with Excel"".
2. Consider rephrasing ""analyzing trends"" to ""identifying patterns and trends"" to make the language more precise and technical, aligning with the topic of Learning Excel.
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Learning Excel, consider removing the phrase ""seeing the vast amount of data collected from the bike share project"" as it is more related to the bike share project rather than the learning of Excel itself.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the hands-on experience with Excel to be the most engaging, particularly when analyzing data and identifying patterns and trends.

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.

 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part

1. Consider rephrasing ""particularly due to the lack of a solution key to study from"" to ""due to the lack of a solution key, which made it difficult to study and prepare for the exam"" to make the sentence more concise and focused on the impact of the solution key on exam preparation.
2. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""with a few mentioning the exam 2 material"" as it is not a major point and can be removed without affecting the overall meaning of the summary.
3. Consider adding more specific details about the exam practice, such as ""some students found the model part of the practice exam confusing"" to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issues students faced with the exam practice.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the practice exam to be the most confusing aspect of the lecture, due to the lack of a solution key, which made it difficult to study and prepare for the exam. Some students also found the model part of the practice exam confusing, and a few mentioned exam 2 material as an area of concern."

 The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
 I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
 For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number. 
 I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.

 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
 Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward.

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific source of confusion, which is the discrepancy in numbers between the Brightspace slides and the in-class presentation, rather than stating that the topic was ""straightforward"" for most students.

2. Emphasize the impact of the discrepancy on the in-class activity, as it was a significant point of confusion for many students. This could be done by adding a sentence or phrase to highlight the consequences of the discrepancy, such as ""This discrepancy led to uncertainty and confusion during the in-class activity, causing some students to struggle with the calculations.""

3. Consider adding a sentence to acknowledge the efforts of the instructor to clarify the discrepancy, as some students mentioned that the issue was resolved after explanation.

Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade.
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing.
However, I’m somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing inthe first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
Maybe more details in the CATME assignments.
Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually.In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester?
When will we be starting the first project?","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two main points of confusion (BikeShare project details and assignment due dates) into one sentence, such as ""Some students were unclear about the BikeShare project details and assignment due dates, which caused confusion.""
2. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence about navigating Brightspace and CATME assignments, as it is not directly related to HW and Project Directions/Instruction. 
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""However, some students were unclear about the BikeShare project details"" to ""Some students were unclear about the BikeShare project details, specifically how it will work and what is expected."" This will provide more clarity and specificity to the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the first lecture clear and straightforward, with most expressing understanding of the class dynamics and expectations. However, some students were unclear about the BikeShare project details and assignment due dates, which caused confusion."

Many students felt that more detailed explanations and clarification on the laminar approach, as well as the related concepts of r^2, SST, and SSE, would have been beneficial for a clearer understanding.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do!

1.  Clarify the specific confusion around the laminar approach: The original summary mentions that students were confused about the laminar approach, but it would be more specific to mention that students had trouble understanding its application, particularly in relation to assignments A10 and A11, and the related concepts of r^2, SST, and SSE.
2.  Emphasize the need for more detailed explanations: The original summary mentions that more detailed explanations would have been beneficial, but it would be more effective to highlight the specific areas where students felt they needed more clarification, such as the laminar approach, r^2, SST, and SSE.
3.  Remove the positive comments: The original summary mentions that students found the lecture straightforward and clear, which is not directly related to the focused topic of the laminar approach.

1.  To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific areas of confusion related to SSE, SST, r, and r^2, rather than stating that the lecture was ""straightforward and clear"" in general. This would allow for a more targeted analysis of the students' concerns.
2.  Consider rephrasing the summary to highlight the common thread of confusion among students regarding the application of SSE, SST, and r^2 values in assignments A10 and A11, rather than mentioning the laminar approach separately. This would provide a clearer connection between the topic and the students' concerns.
3.  To make the summary more concise, consider combining the two main points into a single sentence, such as: ""Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be clear, but struggled with applying these concepts in assignments A10 and A11, particularly with regards to using SSE, SST, and r^2 values in data analysis.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be clear, but struggled with applying these concepts in assignments A10 and A11, particularly with regards to using SSE, SST, and r^2 values in data analysis."

1. Consider breaking down the summary into two separate points to better highlight the specific areas of confusion: one for the in-class assignment and another for the project. This will provide a clearer understanding of the students' concerns.
2. Emphasize the frequency of the confusion by quantifying the number of students who experienced unclear instructions, e.g., ""Many students (X out of Y) found the instructions for the in-class assignment and project unclear...""
3. Use more specific language to describe the sources of confusion, such as ""conflicting messages in different resources"" and ""outdated information on Brightspace,"" to provide a clearer picture of the issues students faced.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students (15 out of 30) found the instructions for the in-class assignment and project unclear, particularly regarding the scope of the project, specific tasks, and expectations. Confusion arose from conflicting messages in different resources, outdated information on Brightspace, and unclear expectations for problem scoping and stakeholder involvement."

 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers.

I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.

 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""particularly with regards to"" to make the sentence more direct and to the point. This will help to focus the summary on the topic of calculations and avoid unnecessary words.

2. To make the summary more specific to the topic of calculations, consider removing the phrase ""interpreting the results"" as it is not directly related to the calculations themselves, but rather to the understanding of the results of the calculations.

3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of calculations, consider removing the phrase ""and creating mathematical models"" as it is a separate topic that is not directly related to the calculations, but rather to the application of the calculations. This will help to keep the summary focused on the topic of calculations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class calculations confusing, struggling with understanding which variables to use and how to apply formulas.

mathematical models","SUMMARY: Students found the mathematical modeling aspects of the lecture to be confusing, particularly with regards to in-class assignments and activities. Many struggled with understanding formulas and equations, such as the power equation and pressure head, and had difficulty applying them to the Taum Sauk project. Some students also found it challenging to create mathematical models, specifically with the laminar approach, and needed more guidance on deriving equations from tables and using Excel for regression.

Suggestions:
1. Provide more explicit examples of how to apply formulas and equations to real-world problems, such as the Taum Sauk project, to help students better understand their application.
2. Offer additional guidance on the laminar approach, including step-by-step instructions on how to derive equations from tables and use Excel for regression, to help students overcome their difficulties with this concept.
3. Clarify the instructions for in-class assignments and activities, providing clear explanations of what is expected and how to complete tasks, to reduce student confusion and frustration.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the mathematical modeling aspects of the lecture to be challenging, particularly with in-class assignments and activities.

How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel
I think we should’ve talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing.
I’m confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume","SUMMARY: Students found the laminar approach challenging to understand, particularly in terms of creating mathematical models and deriving equations from tables. Many students were unclear on how to apply the laminar approach, with some expressing frustration with the lack of explanation and examples in class. Some students also struggled with understanding how to simplify diagrams and identify relevant variables for the models.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit examples of applying the laminar approach, including step-by-step guides on how to derive equations from tables and create mathematical models.
2. Offer additional support for students in understanding how to simplify diagrams and identify relevant variables for the models, such as providing a clear explanation of the process and offering additional resources for practice.
3. Consider providing more guidance on how to use the laminar approach in Excel, as some students expressed confusion on this topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the laminar approach challenging to understand, particularly in terms of creating mathematical models and deriving equations from tables.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider focusing on the most common theme of confusion, which is the practical implementation of prototyping, and rephrase the summary to reflect this. For example: ""Students generally found the concept of prototyping clear, but had minor confusion regarding the practical implementation of prototypes, including materials, tools, and testing processes.""
2. Some students mentioned the lack of clarity regarding specific tools and software, such as 3D design programs. Consider adding this point to the summary to make it more comprehensive. For example: ""Students generally found the concept of prototyping clear, but had minor confusion regarding the practical implementation of prototypes, including materials, tools (such as 3D design programs), and testing processes.""
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the phrase ""particularly in terms of materials and tools"" as it seems to be a general statement that doesn't specifically relate to prototyping.

1.  Focus on the most prominent theme: The summary is a good start, but it could be more concise by focusing on the most prominent theme that emerges from the reflections. In this case, it seems that the hands-on approach to Assignment 17 was the most engaging aspect, and the pros and cons identification was a key part of that. Consider rephrasing the summary to emphasize this.
2.  Remove repetitive language: Some of the reflections mention the same ideas multiple times, such as ""pros and cons"" or ""brainstorming process."" Consider condensing these into a single point to avoid repetition in the summary.
3.  Highlight the unique aspects: While the summary mentions the biomimicry segment, it could be more specific about what exactly sparked interest in the students. For example, was it the idea of learning from nature-inspired solutions, or the specific examples of biomimicry that were discussed?

 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught
 The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
 Nothing, everything was clear.

 There was really nothing confusing in today's class, the in class activity and environmental/economic impacts fir assignment 13 were explained very clearly 
 How dropped grades factor into the midterm grade that is displayed 
 I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable.",275,"The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slideabout the calculations for the participation’s other than to try totrip us up.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us butit seemed meaningless.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity.
It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","Suggestions: 

1. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""but some were initially confused"" and instead focus on the main point that students generally found the concept of Gasoline Density understandable. This would make the summary more direct and to the point.

2. To improve the summary's focus on the topic, consider removing the mention of ""carbon emissions"" and instead focus solely on Gasoline Density. This would ensure that the summary stays on topic and does not stray into related but distinct concepts.

3. To make the summary more specific and accurate, consider adding a sentence that highlights the specific aspect of Gasoline Density that students found confusing, such as its inclusion in the in-class activity or its relation to the overall topic. This would provide more detail and clarity to the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of Gasoline Density understandable, but some were initially confused about its inclusion in the in-class activity and its relevance to the overall topic."
176,"SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on engineering failures engaging and insightful, particularly the case study of the Taum Sauk reservoir, which highlighted the consequences of negligence, lack of ethics, and oversights in engineering design and communication. Many appreciated the opportunity to work in groups and analyze real-world examples of engineering disasters, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail, good communication, and considering all possible perspectives to prevent catastrophic failures.",Engineering Failures,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.

 I liked that I was able to spend more time with my group mates so that i could work on A12.
 I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an interesting part of today's class. It was interesting because we got to see decision failures. 
 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
 I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred. 
 What was interesting about today's class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster. 
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.
 when rebuilding the dam, the company again refused to spend more money to add one. 
 The different causes of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. It reminds me that there are almost always multiple reasons for an engineering failure

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining

1. Consider breaking down the summary into two separate paragraphs to clearly distinguish between the concerns regarding Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. This will help to provide a more organized and focused summary.
2. Emphasize the specific aspects of Assignment 10 that caused confusion, such as the laminar approach, mathematical modeling, and the unclear expectations for parts 4 and 5. This will provide a more detailed understanding of the students' concerns.
3. Use more precise language to convey the students' concerns about the in-class activity, such as ""students struggled with unclear expectations"" or ""students found it challenging to complete the activity within the given time frame."" This will help to accurately represent the students' experiences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding the clarity of Assignment 10 instructions, particularly with parts 4 and 5, where the laminar approach and mathematical modeling requirements were unclear.

 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do.

2. Emphasize the specific benefits of groupwork, such as ""improved understanding"" and ""increased confidence"", to make the summary more focused on the topic. For example, ""Many appreciated the clarity and productivity that came from working in groups, which improved their understanding of the material and boosted their confidence in their abilities.""

3. Remove the phrase ""particularly in calculating payback periods and capital investments"" to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of groupwork. This phrase is somewhat tangential to the main point about groupwork and can be removed without losing any essential information.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the breakout groups and in-class activities to be the most engaging and interesting aspects of the lecture, as they allowed for collaborative learning and practical application of concepts.

Trade off designs were also interesting because they introduced a new idea to us that sounds like a good tool to use.
The discussion of design trade offs was very interesting to me.Providing examples as well as the importance of them was a topic thatvery much appealed to me.","Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing ""key takeaway"" to a more specific concept or idea, such as ""the concept of trade-offs in environmental impact"" to make the summary more concise.
2. Remove the phrase ""such as vehicle emissions"" to make the sentence more direct and focused on the topic of trade-offs.
3. Consider rephrasing ""emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors and their consequences in problem-solving"" to ""highlighting the need for engineers to balance competing priorities"" to make the language more concise and specific to the topic of trade-offs.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of trade-offs in environmental impact to be a key concept from the lecture, appreciating the hands-on experience of calculating their own carbon footprint and understanding the trade-offs involved in everyday decisions.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information

 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the first two sentences into one, as they both convey the same idea that the lecture was clear and easy to follow. This would allow for more space to focus on the specific areas of confusion mentioned by students.

2. Consider rephrasing the third sentence to focus more on the specific areas of confusion, rather than just stating that some students were unclear about the amount of work required. This would help to make the summary more specific and focused on the topic of project logistics.

3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""Additionally"" and instead directly state the two areas of confusion mentioned by students, such as ""specific sections required for assignment A16"" and ""distinction between criteria and constraints."" This would help to make the summary more direct and to the point.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on project logistics straightforward and easy to follow, but some areas of confusion arose, particularly around the scope of the problem statement and the specific sections required for assignment A16, as well as the distinction between criteria and constraints."

 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype.

 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand

there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart. 
 I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
 Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
 I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment. 
 There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
 I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth. 
 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught
 The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
 Nothing, everything was clear.

 It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
 The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem. 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. 
 I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
 I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers. 
 Design issues as a whole
 I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
 I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.
 Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting 
 I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
 I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
 The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
 Something interesting in today's class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it. 
 The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
 I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
 The design problem was quite interesting.

 I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
 I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting 
 I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer

the demonstration of how changing current inductance or resistance would change the graph 
The time that we can get for each V, C, 
The phaser magnets! 
I think the RLC graphing is interesting.
I was very interested to see the demonstration where we changed each variable and found that there was a large difference when looking at the graph
Phasor wheel, made the concepts easier to understand. 
 I found it interesting to see the vectors and how they aligned with the graph. Seeing them at the same time was a really helpful visual for me and the friends I sit with in class.
 The charts were fairly interesting and how they relate to each other as well as to time
 how phasers work

 The vector example you gave was an interesting way of seeing the sin function 
 how so many things are represented by a sinusoidal function 
 I found it interesting the period of the graph for charge is capacitance independent
 The spinning arrows made it more clear how the equations related to eachother
 The fast that all the voltages add up to emf.
 The animated graphs of voltage of a capacitor, resistor, and inductor 
 I thought the simulator graph showing how the three functions relate to the sin/cos curves and it helped me to better visualize and understand what was going on.

 The visual representation of the vectors and graphs was helpful
 I liked the computer simulation of the phasors.

 The graph of the phasors on geogebra
 Amplitude and frequency of currents
 How inductors work 
 I found the visual with the dampening oscillation very interesting. That helped me visually understand how the graph changes when some of the factors change.
 The difference between inductive and conductive
 the different plots of the devices based on the things connected to it
 I thought that being able to compare everything graphically was really interesting.
 The demonstrations 
 I like the graph you showed on screen and how it changed when you changed certain parts of the circuit. 
 I found the math to be interesting since the equation relates to the graph so nicely 
 Knowing the period of a function can replace the time variable
 I found the oscillation of current to be very interesting because i thought current would only be some to flow constantly in one direction. 
 The demonstration 
 Oscilloscope demonstration of how changing capacitance, resistance, and inductance changes voltage oscillations
 I found the problem solving interesting. Even though the concepts were tough, the problem solving made sense.

The example problem with an RLC circuit at its resonance frequency 
I liked the last word problem we did as a class. 
The oscilloscope greatly increased my understanding of a circuit at resonance.
 I really liked the demonstration that showed that resonance is a higher amplitude
 how Z and R are related

 The idea of a current lagging or leading the emf is interesting because you can learn about the other aspects from it. 
 That current leads if there is a negative phase angle. 
 I found the problem solving interesting. It was interesting working out problems and solving.
 demonstrations 
 I liked going over the practice problems we did in class because they were quite helpful for solving the homework. 
 The demo with the sin waves
 The oscillations were pretty interesting
 having the visual representation of the phasors made it easier to do some of the questions
 I thought it was interesting to see how z = R at resonance.
 I enjoyed the changing oscillating ammeter. 
 visual of waves
 I loved the part in class where we were discussing the conceptual based questions
 The demonstration of the graphs
 Difference between wd and w
 Knowing the differences between the three with graphs and equations
 At resonance,  X_L=X_C
 Phasers are fun
 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution

They appreciated visual representations, such as the oscilloscope and sin waves, which aided in grasping concepts like resonance, phase angles, and the relationship between Z and R. Students also found the practice problems and demonstrations to be effective in solidifying their understanding of phasors and graphs.

Suggestions:
1. Emphasize the specific visual aids that resonated with students, such as the oscilloscope and sin waves, to highlight their effectiveness in conveying complex concepts.
2. Highlight the connection between the visual representations and the students' understanding of resonance, phase angles, and the relationship between Z and R, to show how the visual aids facilitated their comprehension.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the ""phasors"" aspect, as it was a key concept that students found engaging and helpful, rather than just mentioning it as part of the broader topic of graphs.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of phasors to be particularly engaging, leveraging visual aids like the oscilloscope and sin waves to grasp complex concepts such as resonance, phase angles, and the relationship between Z and R. The visual representations effectively aided their understanding of these concepts, making it easier to solidify their knowledge through practice problems and demonstrations."
