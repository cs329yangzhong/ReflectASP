Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense.
I really didn’t understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively.
I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.","Here is a summary of the focused topic TopHat/In class questions:

The students generally found the TopHat questions to be well-explained, but some felt that the time allocated was insufficient, leading to rushed answers. Some students also reported initial confusion with the diagrams used to illustrate the concepts, but the professor's explanations helped to clarify the material.

Suggestions:

1. Consider providing more time for students to answer TopHat questions to allow for more thoughtful and accurate responses. This could be achieved by allocating more time for the questions or by staggering the release of questions throughout the lecture.
2. Provide additional support for students who may be struggling with the diagrams used to illustrate the concepts. This could include providing additional visual aids or examples to help students better understand the material.
3. Consider providing more explicit explanations for the concepts of grounding and the Shell Theorems, as these were areas of confusion for some students. This could include providing additional examples or analogies to help students better understand these concepts.","REFINED SUMMARY: The students generally found the TopHat questions to be well-explained, but some felt that the time allocated was insufficient, leading to rushed answers.

The use of real-world examples, such as the hockey game and the yeti problem, helped to illustrate the practical applications of vector addition and made the concept more relatable. Students also appreciated the emphasis on visualizing vectors and using triangles to add them, which helped to clarify the process. Overall, students found the topic of Vector Addition to be well-explained and enjoyable to learn.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

the two tensions instead of one
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
How you could put more than one object in a system

The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Tension
Original Summary: SUMMARY: Students were generally confused about the concept of tension, particularly when it comes to pulleys and multiple tension forces. Many students struggled to understand why tension is represented as a positive force, and how it is affected by the direction of the force and the angle of the normal force. Some students found it challenging to set up free body diagrams, especially when dealing with multiple objects and forces. Additionally, the concept of doubling the tension force when using a pulley was a common point of confusion. Students also had difficulty understanding how to apply the concept of tension to real-world scenarios, such as the man lifting himself up using a rope. Overall, students would benefit from more examples and explanations to help solidify their understanding of tension.

Suggestions:

1. Consider breaking down the concept of tension into smaller, more manageable parts, such as explaining why tension is represented as a positive force and how it is affected by the direction of the force and the angle of the normal force. This could help students better understand the underlying principles of tension and how it applies to different scenarios.
2. Provide more examples and explanations of how to set up free body diagrams, particularly when dealing with multiple objects and forces. This could include step-by-step instructions and visual aids to help students better understand the process.
3. Emphasize the importance of considering the direction of the force and the angle of the normal force when applying the concept of tension to real-world scenarios. This could include providing more examples of how tension is used in everyday life, such as in pulleys and ropes, and how it affects the motion of objects.","REFINED SUMMARY:

Students struggled to relate theoretical concepts to real-life examples, visualize and understand the direction of forces in complex problems, and grasp the concept of phantom forces. Some students also found it difficult to apply Newton's laws to solve problems, and a few were confused by the use of different reference frames. To improve understanding, it is suggested to provide more concrete and relatable examples, emphasize visualization and understanding of force direction, and offer more practice problems and examples to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts."

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it

 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse

 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.

 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?

The majority of students found the lecture on Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs to be clear and easy to follow. However, some students struggled with the concept of the right-hand rule and its application to 2D graphs, particularly when determining the direction of the z-axis. Additionally, some students found the transition from displacement to velocity and acceleration graphs to be confusing, and would benefit from more practice and examples.

Suggestions:

* Emphasize the importance of visualizing the right-hand rule in 2D graphs and provide more examples to help students understand its application.
* Provide more practice problems and examples to help students transition from displacement to velocity and acceleration graphs, and to clarify the concept of the right-hand rule.
* Consider providing additional resources, such as videos or animations, to help students visualize the right-hand rule and its application to 2D graphs.","Here is a refined summary:

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

3. Use more specific language: The summary could be improved by using more specific language to describe the students' struggles, such as ""many students had difficulty distinguishing between average and instantaneous velocity"" rather than ""a few students had difficulty distinguishing between average and instantaneous velocity"".

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity

 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.

SUMMARY: The topic of Relative Motion was a source of confusion for many students, with several students expressing difficulty in understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and how to apply kinematic equations in different scenarios. The monkey and bullet example was a common point of confusion, with some students struggling to understand the setup and equations involved. Additionally, students found it challenging to conceptualize relative speed, particularly when objects are moving at different velocities. However, many students appreciated the in-class examples and videos, which helped to clarify the concept. Overall, students would benefit from more practice problems and examples to reinforce their understanding of relative motion.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the specific difficulties students had with relative motion, such as adding and subtracting vectors, and provide more examples and practice problems to help students overcome these challenges.
2. Emphasize the importance of conceptualizing relative speed and provide more visual aids and analogies to help students understand this concept.
3. Consider providing more detailed explanations and examples of the monkey and bullet problem, as this was a common point of confusion for many students.","REFINED SUMMARY:

nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of avector to another one, when both are going in a different directionfrom the origin, you have to subtract, right?
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions wererepresented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea ofvectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collisionproblem so I struggled to set it up.
I’m confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector.
Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I justhave issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given.
When given a word problem like the one example of the players hittingthe puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vectorwould be going in
How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not tosubtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believethat is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly drawout the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is askingus to do than the actual math itself.
How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them.
The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors.
How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
One thing I’d like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn’talready been specified in the question. Will you expect a specificnotion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>)acceptable too?
I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectorsgeometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings forword problems.
A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Nowwhen I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end ofclass I was beginning to understand through techniques like the tracemethod.
Need more description about how you know what directions you drawvectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to findthe expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two othervectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the firstvector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused andothers in my breakout room were too.
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic.
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtractand when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not knowif you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them.
It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics.
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graphproblem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity inorder to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors inthe scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectorsby Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows tosuit a given equation when they are all out of order.
However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how theyaffect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know yousaid that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, speciallythe purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Vector Math lecture:

Summary: Students generally found the lecture on Vector Math clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. Many students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in specific problem scenarios. Some students also found the concept of unit vectors and their application to be unclear. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the use of sin and cos functions in vector math, as well as the conversion of angles. Overall, students appreciated the use of visual aids and examples to illustrate vector concepts, and many felt that the lecture was well-paced and easy to follow.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit examples and explanations for when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in problem scenarios. This could include more worked-out examples and practice problems for students to try.
2. Offer additional support for students who are struggling with the concept of unit vectors and their application. This could include additional examples, practice problems, or even a separate review session.
3. Clarify the use of sin and cos functions in vector math, including when to use each and how to convert angles. This could include more explicit explanations and examples in the lecture notes or online resources.
4. Consider providing more visual aids and examples to help students understand the concept of unit vectors and their application. This could include diagrams, graphs, or animations to help illustrate the concept.
5. Provide more opportunities for students to practice and apply their understanding of vector math, such as through practice problems or group work. This could help students solidify their understanding and build confidence in their ability to apply vector math concepts.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Vector Math lecture was generally well-received by students, with most finding the material clear and easy to follow.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors.

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas.

Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help.

 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.

 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after.

It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the TopHat question:

SUMMARY: Students found the TopHat question to be challenging, with some struggling to determine whether to add or subtract vectors. Many students appreciated the use of visual aids and examples to help illustrate the concepts, but some felt that the question was unclear or confusing. Some students also mentioned that they would have liked more guidance on how to approach the question and what to look for in the answer.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit guidance on how to approach the TopHat question, including what to look for in the answer and how to determine whether to add or subtract vectors.
2. Consider providing more examples or visual aids to help students understand the concept of vector addition and subtraction, particularly in the context of the TopHat question.
3. Encourage students to work in pairs or small groups to complete the TopHat question, as this can help them to discuss and clarify any confusion and come up with a solution.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat question challenging, with some struggling to determine whether to add or subtract vectors. Many appreciated the use of visual aids and examples, but some felt the question was unclear or confusing. Some students would have liked more guidance on how to approach the question and what to look for in the answer. Common areas of confusion included determining when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in the context of the TopHat question."

93,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of friction on an incline and the interaction between two blocks with different types of friction to be the most challenging aspects of today's lecture. Many students struggled to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the concept of fsmax. The top hat questions, particularly the ones involving two blocks with friction, were also a source of confusion. Students would benefit from more practice problems and examples that demonstrate the application of friction in different scenarios, as well as a clearer explanation of how to determine the coefficient of friction.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","Here is a summary of the focused topic Two Blocks/Forces/Systems:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of friction on an incline and the interaction between two blocks with different types of friction to be the most challenging aspects of today's lecture. Many students struggled to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the concept of fsmax. The top hat questions, particularly the ones involving two blocks with friction, were also a source of confusion.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the struggles with friction on an incline and the interaction between two blocks. This would reduce the number of sentences and make the summary more focused on the main points.
2. Consider rephrasing some of the sentences to make them more concise and clear. For example, instead of saying ""Many students struggled to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the concept of fsmax,"" you could say ""Students struggled to grasp the distinction between static and kinetic friction and how to apply fsmax.""
3. Consider adding more specific examples or details to support the points made in the summary. For example, you could provide a specific example of a top hat question that was particularly confusing for students, or describe a common mistake that students made when applying the concept of fsmax.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of friction on an incline and the interaction between two blocks with different types of friction to be the most challenging aspects of today's lecture.

Summary: Students' reflections on friction revealed challenges with understanding friction on an incline, applying forces to multiple objects, and distinguishing between static and kinetic friction. Top hat questions, particularly those involving blocks and pulleys, were confusing for many. Students also struggled with determining the force needed to move an object and combining forces in complex systems.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of visualizing the forces acting on an object when solving problems involving friction on an incline. This could be done by providing more examples or encouraging students to draw their own free body diagrams.
2. Use more concrete, real-world examples to illustrate the difference between static and kinetic friction, such as the example of sneakers and the ground while running. This could help students better understand the concept and its applications.
3. Provide more practice problems that involve static friction, as students expressed a desire for more examples and practice with this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students' reflections on friction revealed challenges with understanding friction on an incline, applying forces to multiple objects, and distinguishing between static and kinetic friction.

 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.

SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex systems. Many struggled with understanding static and kinetic friction, determining the correct type of friction, and creating equivalent problems and diagrams. Students also had difficulty combining forces and FBDs for multiple objects, such as the two-block system.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider highlighting the most common areas of confusion, such as the difference between static and kinetic friction, and the difficulty in determining the correct type of friction to use. This could help the instructor focus on addressing these specific areas in future lectures.
2. Consider adding more specific examples or explanations to the summary to illustrate the challenges students faced with FBDs. For example, the summary could mention the difficulty students had with the two-block system or the frictionless surface problem.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas or eliminating redundant information. For example, the summary could combine the points about static and kinetic friction into a single sentence.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex systems.

Circular motion was a challenging topic for many students, with centripetal force being a major point of confusion. Students struggled to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle and how to apply the equations of circular motion to real-world problems. Additionally, students found it difficult to grasp the concept of drag force, particularly in situations where multiple forces are acting simultaneously.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more examples and applications of centripetal force to help students better understand its relationship to acceleration and its application in different scenarios.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the drag force formula and its units, and provide more practice problems to help students become more comfortable with its application.
3. Consider providing more visual aids and diagrams to help students visualize the concept of circular motion and the forces acting on an object moving in a circle.","REFINED SUMMARY: Circular motion was a challenging topic for many students, with centripetal force being a major point of confusion. Students struggled to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle and how to apply the equations of circular motion to real-world problems.

Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities.

 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
 N/A
 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing. 
 Everything is pretty clear

 How metrics were different than criteria 
 I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
 The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
 Nothing was confusing and the weighted decision matrix was actually explained very well.
 i am running on not much sleep everything is confusing including English ",109,"it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgotthat we didn’t have to do the whole thing, so I got confused.
It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity

Summary: The in-class activity on weighted decision matrices (WDM) was a source of confusion for many students. Students struggled with understanding what parts of the template to fill out, distinguishing between criteria and metrics, and choosing criteria for the activity. Some students also found it challenging to determine specific numbers for the metrics. However, many students found the explanation of WDMs to be clear and understandable.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the most common areas of confusion, such as the distinction between criteria and metrics, and providing additional clarification or examples to help students better understand these concepts.
2. Emphasize the importance of reviewing the template and instructions carefully before starting the in-class activity to avoid confusion about what parts to fill out.
3. Provide more guidance on how to choose criteria for the activity and how to determine specific numbers for the metrics, as these were areas of struggle for many students.","REFINED SUMMARY: The in-class activity on weighted decision matrices (WDM) was a source of confusion for many students, particularly in understanding what parts of the template to fill out, distinguishing between criteria and metrics, and choosing criteria for the activity.

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

SUMMARY: Many students were confused about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, which made it difficult for them to study and prepare for the exam. Some students also found the model part of the practice exam confusing. Additionally, the technical issues with Brightspace and WiFi connectivity caused frustration and confusion for many students, making it hard to follow along with the class and complete the in-class assignment.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the two main points about the practice exam (lack of solution key and model part being confusing) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Many students were confused about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, which made it difficult to study and prepare, and found the model part of the practice exam confusing.""
* Emphasize the impact of the technical issues on students' learning experience by rephrasing the sentence about Brightspace and WiFi connectivity to something like: ""Technical issues with Brightspace and WiFi connectivity caused significant disruption and frustration, making it challenging for students to follow along with the class and complete the in-class assignment.""
* Consider adding a sentence to highlight the overall sentiment of the students, such as: ""Despite the technical issues, many students found the class helpful and were able to understand the material, with some even feeling confident about their understanding of the exam material."" This would provide a more balanced view of the class and show that not all students were negatively impacted by the technical issues.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students were confused about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, which made it difficult to study and prepare, and found the model part of the practice exam confusing.

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects andquizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know rememberwhat to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, soif more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might helpthose students.
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Shareproject will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the nextlecture.
he only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3.
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?

SUMMARY: The students found the design process to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture, with many highlighting the importance of problem scoping, idea generation, and working in teams. They appreciated the hands-on approach, enjoying the time spent working on the project in class and the flexibility to design their own solutions. The relevance of the project to their own experiences as students on campus was also a significant factor in their interest.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the design process, eliminating sentences that mention the project's relevance to their experiences as students on campus. This will help to maintain a clear focus on the topic.
2. Emphasize the key takeaways from the students' reflections, such as the importance of problem scoping and idea generation, and the value of working in teams. This will help to distill the main points and make the summary more concise.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to use more precise language, such as ""problem scoping and idea generation were the most engaging aspects of the design process"" instead of ""the design process was the most engaging aspect of the lecture"". This will help to make the summary more clear and concise.","REFINED SUMMARY: The students found the design process to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture, with many highlighting the importance of problem scoping and idea generation.

Overall, the students are looking forward to working on the project and are eager to apply their skills to a meaningful and relevant problem.

Suggestions:

* Consider condensing the summary to focus on the most common themes and ideas. For example, the original summary mentions ""problem scoping and design process"" as particularly interesting, but it would be more concise to simply state that ""students found the design process and problem scoping to be the most interesting aspects of the project"".
* Emphasize the students' enthusiasm and excitement about the project, as this is a key takeaway from their reflections. For example, the original summary mentions that ""many students expressed excitement about the flexibility and autonomy of the project"", but it would be more effective to start the summary with a sentence like ""Students were thrilled to dive into the project, which offers a high degree of flexibility and autonomy"".
* Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight the relevance and importance of the project to the students' own experiences and interests. For example, the original summary mentions that the project ""allows them to design their own solutions to improve campus mobility"", but it would be more effective to emphasize how this relates to the students' own experiences as Purdue students, such as ""by designing solutions to improve campus mobility, students will have the opportunity to make a tangible impact on their own campus community"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were thrilled to dive into the project, which offers a high degree of flexibility and autonomy.

SUMMARY: Many students were unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, particularly regarding the source of feedback and how to incorporate it into the iteration process. Some students found the concept of iteration and feedback confusing, and wished for more guidance on how to complete the assignment.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the specific points of confusion regarding feedback, such as ""students were unclear about the source of feedback"" and ""found the concept of iteration and feedback confusing"". This would make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of feedback.
2. Remove the phrase ""particularly regarding the source of feedback and how to incorporate it into the iteration process"" as it is a bit redundant and takes away from the main point of the summary. Instead, focus on the specific points of confusion.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and clear. For example, ""Students were unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, finding the concept of iteration and feedback confusing, and wishing for more guidance on how to complete the assignment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students were unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, finding the concept of iteration and feedback confusing.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and rephrasing some of the sentences to reduce redundancy. For example, the first sentence could be rephrased to ""Many students were unclear about the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, particularly the iteration process and feedback expectations."" This would eliminate the need for the second sentence and make the summary more concise.
2. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of the assignment that caused confusion, rather than simply stating that the information was unclear. For example, the summary could highlight the specific components of the assignment that students were unclear about, such as the number of ideas to generate and the format of the pros and cons list.
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic of Deliverables/Instructions Unclear, consider removing the sentence ""Overall, students would have benefited from more clarification and guidance on the assignment's expectations and requirements."" This sentence is more general and could be removed to make the summary more focused on the specific issues with the assignment's deliverables and instructions.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students were unclear about the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, particularly the iteration process and feedback expectations.

SUMMARY: Students found the topic of Car CO2 Emissions to be engaging and thought-provoking, with many being surprised to learn about the significant impact their individual carbon footprint has on the environment. The use of the website to calculate their carbon footprint was a highlight for many, allowing them to visualize their own impact on the environment. Students also found the concept of ""good gas mileage"" to be interesting, noting that even cars with good fuel efficiency still emit a significant amount of CO2.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific numbers and statistics related to Car CO2 Emissions, as many students mentioned being surprised by the magnitude of their own carbon footprint. This could help to make the topic more concrete and tangible for students.
2. Emphasize the importance of considering ethics in engineering when designing solutions to reduce carbon emissions. Many students mentioned the concept of ethics in engineering being interesting, but it could be explored more deeply in the summary.

 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult.

SUMMARY: The majority of students did not find today's class confusing, with many stating that the lecture was straightforward and the examples provided were helpful. However, some students did express confusion regarding the laminar approach, particularly in understanding its application and how to use it to solve problems. Additionally, a few students found the explanations of SSE, SST, and r^2 values to be unclear, and some were confused about the requirements for Assignment 10 and how to approach the mathematical models.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific points of confusion, such as the laminar approach and SSE, SST, and r^2 values, rather than just stating that some students were confused.
2. Break up the summary into two separate paragraphs, one for the students who did not find the class confusing and one for the students who did, to provide a clearer distinction between the two groups.
3. Consider adding more specific details about the types of problems or concepts that students found confusing, such as the volume-height regression equation or the use of the laminar approach in Assignment 10.","REFINED SUMMARY:

When the teacher explained the pressure head, I was a little confused by what factors go into this. Is it just a height ? 
 I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir.
 I think the class was well explained today. 
 How to take exam
 This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more as well as more specifics on the exam next week.
 How to completely calculate the power
 nothing.
 The quiz modules did not show up at 3.
 It would have been nice to see the class slides on brightspace during lecture.
 Basically everything made sense today, i never really had any questions but the ones i did were answered when we went into breakout rooms. It would have been nice if we could have done some review on the quiz
 The most confusing part of today's class was figuring out if we had to do an I class activity.  The activity was never mentioned in the meeting so I was confused if I needed to submit anything.
 Nothing seemed to be confusing at all in today's class!
 Nothing was confusing. We just sat in breakout rooms working on the projects.
 I didn't find anything confusing in class today.
 I thought how we calculate volumetric flow rate was a little bit confusing.
 How the excel will work for the in class quiz
 Everything seemed straight forward to me. If something seems unclear I will look at the slides or ask questions. 
 We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
 I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
 I didn't have any confusion in class today.
 After showing the slide on assignment 10, I know I did the models wrong but it wasn't explained how to do it correctly.

The use of excel for A12 needed for explanation","Here is the summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion. However, some students struggled with specific concepts, such as converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding the instructions for Assignment 10 or 12. A few students were unclear about the in-class activity or the use of Excel for Assignment 12.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of Assignment 10 or 12, rather than mentioning general clarity of the lecture. For example, the summary could start with ""Students had varying levels of understanding regarding Assignment 10 or 12, with some struggling to understand the instructions or calculate pressure head.""
2. Remove the phrase ""with most reporting no confusion"" as it is not directly related to the topic of Assignment 10 or 12. Instead, focus on the specific areas where students were struggling.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused. For example, ""Students had difficulty with specific aspects of Assignment 10 or 12, including converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding Excel usage.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had varying levels of understanding regarding Assignment 10 or 12, with some struggling to understand the instructions, calculate pressure head, and utilize Excel.

I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class assignment and project deliverables to be the most confusing aspects of today's lecture. Some students were unclear about the specific tasks required for Assignment 16, including the problem statement, stakeholder identification, and research expectations. Others were confused about the project's scope and what was expected to be completed for the upcoming deadline. Additionally, some students struggled with understanding the instructions and requirements for the project, particularly regarding the open-ended nature of the assignment and how to obtain information from stakeholders.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining similar points: The summary mentions ""some students were unclear about the specific tasks required for Assignment 16"" and ""others were confused about the project's scope and what was expected to be completed for the upcoming deadline"". These points could be combined into a single sentence to make the summary more concise.
2. Focus on the most common points of confusion: While the summary mentions several areas of confusion, it's clear that the majority of students were struggling with Assignment 16. Consider focusing the summary on the most common points of confusion related to this assignment, such as the problem statement, stakeholder identification, and research expectations.
3. Avoid using vague language: The summary uses phrases such as ""some students"" and ""others"", which could be replaced with more specific language to make the summary more concrete. For example, instead of saying ""some students were unclear about the specific tasks required for Assignment 16"", consider saying ""many students struggled to understand the problem statement and stakeholder identification components of Assignment 16"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 16 to be the most confusing aspect of today's lecture, struggling to understand the problem statement, stakeholder identification, and research expectations. Specifically, students were unclear about the specific tasks required, including what to include in the problem statement and how to obtain information from stakeholders. Additionally, some students were confused about the project's scope and what was expected to be completed for the upcoming deadline."

 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better.

 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet

I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
I found the reasons for dam failure to be quite captivating. That was a cool part of class to investigate those failures.
The destruction of Taum Sauk was very interesting because understanding adisaster is always very intriguing and interesting to look at.
finding the various reasons behind the reservoir failure was enjoyable
The failures of the Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting and the fact that cutting corners backfired
Taum sauk failure","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Tom Sauk Reservoir:

Summary: The Tom Sauk Reservoir was a central topic of discussion in today's class, with students finding it captivating to explore the various engineering failures that led to its catastrophic collapse. Many students appreciated the real-world example of how oversights and negligence can have devastating consequences. The class highlighted the importance of attention to detail, good communication, and considering all possible perspectives in engineering projects.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific causes of the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failure, such as the lack of proper land surveying and the refusal to spend more money to add a spillway. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of the events leading up to the disaster.
2. Emphasize the role of ethics in engineering failures, as many students mentioned the importance of considering all possible perspectives and avoiding shortcuts. This could lead to a more in-depth discussion on the moral implications of engineering decisions.
3. Use more concrete examples and data to illustrate the consequences of engineering failures, such as the impact on the environment and human lives. This could help students better understand the significance of attention to detail and good communication in engineering projects.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Tom Sauk Reservoir's catastrophic collapse was a prime example of engineering failures, with students finding it captivating to explore the various oversights and negligence that led to the disaster. The class highlighted the importance of attention to detail, good communication, and considering all possible perspectives in engineering projects. Specifically, students noted the significance of proper land surveying, adequate spillway design, and ethical decision-making in preventing such failures. The real-world example of the Tom Sauk Reservoir's collapse served as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of engineering errors, emphasizing the need for engineers to prioritize attention to detail and ethical decision-making in their work."

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.

Some also had difficulty navigating Brightspace to find correct materials. Students requested more practice and examples on filling in missing data and a clearer explanation of z-scores and probability in data analysis.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more detailed explanations and examples for assignments, especially for complex concepts like z-scores and probability.
2. Offer additional practice exercises or examples to help students better understand how to fill in missing data and apply z-scores in data analysis.
3. Improve the organization and clarity of assignment materials in Brightspace, including clear instructions and easy-to-follow directions.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found that the details regarding assignments, particularly Assignments 5 and 8, were unclear or confusing, leading to difficulties in understanding instructions and requirements.

 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Skittles Example:

The Skittles Example was a topic of confusion for many students, particularly when it came to switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Students also struggled with understanding the concept of z-scores and how they relate to probability and normal distributions. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the use of z-scores in the calculus formula for finding area under the curve. Students also expressed a desire for more practice and examples on how to fill in missing data and how to apply probability to real-world scenarios.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions on how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, and offer additional examples to help students understand this concept.
2. Offer more practice exercises and examples on how to calculate and apply z-scores, including how they relate to probability and normal distributions.
3. Provide more detailed explanations and examples on how to use z-scores in the calculus formula for finding area under the curve.
4. Offer additional resources and support for students who are struggling with the concept of z-scores and how to apply them to real-world scenarios.
5. Consider providing more guidance on how to fill in missing data and how to apply probability to real-world scenarios, as this was a topic of confusion for many students.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Skittles Example was a topic of confusion for many students, particularly when it came to switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Students also struggled with understanding the concept of z-scores and their relationship to probability and normal distributions. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the use of z-scores in the calculus formula for finding area under the curve. To address these concerns, it is recommended that instructors provide more explicit instructions and examples on how to switch the x-axis, offer additional practice exercises and examples on z-score calculations and applications, and provide more detailed explanations and examples on the use of z-scores in the calculus formula."

However, some students did express confusion regarding the distinction between clients and stakeholders, as well as the process of empathizing with users. Additionally, there were some concerns about the amount of work required for the assignment and the clarity of the project goals.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points of confusion (distinction between clients and stakeholders, and empathizing with users) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise.
2. Remove the phrase ""most reporting that they did not find anything confusing"" as it's not adding much value to the summary and makes it seem like the majority of students had no issues, which is not the case.
3. Consider rephrasing the last sentence to make it more specific and focused on the topic, for example: ""Additionally, students had concerns about the project's scope and goals, particularly regarding the amount of work required for the assignment.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Clients, Users, and Stakeholders to be clear and straightforward, with some students expressing confusion regarding the distinction between clients and stakeholders, as well as the process of empathizing with users.

Students were surprised by the amount of CO2 emissions produced by their vehicles and appreciated the interactive activities, such as calculating their own carbon footprint. The concept of design trade-offs was also a highlight, as students recognized the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions.

Suggestions:

1. To further emphasize the significance of climate change, consider including more visual aids, such as graphs or charts, to illustrate the impact of human activities on the environment.
2. To make the concept of design trade-offs more concrete, provide more specific examples of how engineers can apply this concept in their work, such as designing more energy-efficient systems or reducing waste in manufacturing processes.
3. To encourage more student participation, consider incorporating more group activities or discussions that allow students to share their own experiences and perspectives on climate change.","REFINED SUMMARY: Today's lecture on climate change sparked engaging discussions and reflections among students, with many finding the topic of carbon footprint and its impact on the environment fascinating.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.

How to calculate environmental impact of the solar panels for a13","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Calculations/Analysis to be clear and straightforward, with most reporting no confusion or difficulty understanding the material. However, some students did express confusion regarding the calculation of carbon emissions, particularly with regards to the inclusion of density in the in-class activity. Additionally, a few students found the discussion of assumptions and trade-offs to be confusing, as it can be challenging to determine which assumptions to make and how to communicate them effectively. Overall, the lecture seemed to provide a solid foundation for understanding the calculations and analysis required for Assignment 13.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points of confusion (carbon emissions calculation and assumptions/trade-offs) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Some students found the lecture on Calculations/Analysis to be clear, but a few reported confusion regarding the calculation of carbon emissions, particularly with regards to density, and the discussion of assumptions and trade-offs, which can be challenging to navigate.""
2. Emphasize the positive aspect of the lecture by highlighting that most students found it clear and straightforward, rather than just stating that some students found it confusing. For example: ""The lecture on Calculations/Analysis was generally well-received, with most students reporting no confusion or difficulty understanding the material. However, a few students did express confusion regarding the calculation of carbon emissions and the discussion of assumptions and trade-offs.""
3. Consider adding a sentence to provide a clearer connection between the lecture and Assignment 13, to help students understand the relevance of the material to their current project. For example: ""The lecture provided a solid foundation for understanding the calculations and analysis required for Assignment 13, and students were able to apply the concepts learned to their own project work.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The lecture on Calculations/Analysis was generally well-received, with most students reporting no confusion or difficulty understanding the material.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1.

For example, the summary could mention that some students struggled to understand how to calculate carbon emissions using gas density.
2. Remove unnecessary information: The summary mentions that some students appreciated the straightforward explanation of trade-offs and climate change, but this information is not directly related to the topic of Gas Density. It would be more effective to focus solely on the topic of Gas Density and avoid including extraneous information.
3. Use more concise language: The summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise and focused on the topic of Gas Density. For example, the summary could be rewritten to focus on the main points that students found confusing or unclear about Gas Density, rather than providing a general overview of the lecture.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of Gas Density to be clear and easy to understand, with most reporting no confusion or difficulties.

This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.

Some students struggled with applying the coffee maker example and biomimicry concept to the assignment. Additionally, students were unclear about the iteration section and end goal of the assignment."
233,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the in-class activity on pros and cons to be straightforward, with some minor difficulties in understanding the assignment requirements and the extent of the activity.

Some students also expressed confusion regarding the level of detail required for the pros and cons diagram and the type of solution needed for the issue of prototyping. Overall, the students appreciated the clear explanations and the help provided by the TAs during the in-class activity.",Pros and cons/in class activity,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.

 What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem. 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. 
 I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
 I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers. 
 Design issues as a whole
 I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
 I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.
 Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting 
 I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
 I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
 The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
 Something interesting in today's class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it. 
 The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
 I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
 The design problem was quite interesting.

 Writing and combining 3 problem statements
 writing the problem statement
 It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
 I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don't repeat them. 
 I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.

 I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
 I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting 
 I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.

* Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the project/assignment, rather than including general comments about the class or instructor. For example, you could remove the sentence ""Students found the starting of the new design project and the concept of problem scoping to be the most interesting aspects of today's class"" and instead focus on the specific aspects of the project that students found interesting.
* Emphasize the key takeaways from the breakout room discussions, such as the importance of assigning roles and brainstorming solutions, rather than simply stating that students enjoyed the discussions.
* Consider adding more specific details about the project, such as the campus safety issue or the idea of creating their own design solutions, to make the summary more concrete and engaging.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the campus safety project assignment to be particularly interesting, as it allowed them to apply their knowledge and skills to a real-world problem.

The two ways we use to traverse trees","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of non-tail recursive functions and the different ways to traverse a binary tree to be the most challenging parts of the lecture. Specifically, they struggled with understanding the mechanics of traversals, particularly preorder and inorder traversal, and the point of different ordered traversal methods. Additionally, some students were confused about the concept of strong buffers and big O notation in the context of backtracking. Students also had questions about tail recursion, including why two recursive calls are allowed in tail recursion and how it can be implemented as a loop.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the two main points about traversal (mechanics and point of different ordered traversal methods) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise.
* Remove the mention of ""strong buffers"" as it is not directly related to the topic of binary trees and seems to be a minor point of confusion.
* Consider rephrasing the sentence about tail recursion to focus more on the specific question students had (why two recursive calls are allowed) rather than the broader concept of tail recursion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of non-tail recursive functions and binary tree traversals to be the most challenging parts of the lecture.

 opening the files
 Some things that were confusing was opening the files for the assignments, but that was expected. Someone eventually helped me out.     However, something else I think would be useful is a calendar with all the due dates for upcoming assignments. For example if it included the pre-class videos and assignments.
 Initially struggled with running a p file, got it once it was explained.
 At first, it was kind of confusing how to download the link and access certain files on the matlab desktop app. The TAs were very helpful if you asked for help, though. 
 It would be helpful if you could go over how we save the text in our command window if there is a way to do that so we can go back to work on code later if needed.
 Just explaining things a bit slower, I would look down at my laptop to follow along and when I would look back at the screen you would already be 3 steps ahead. My whole table was very lost as you were explaining.
 The wording on a submission text-box made it confusing as to whether we should submit the command alone or include the result.

I found recursion very interesting. To be honest I find it a lot easier to understand than strong induction and am looking forward to learning more about recursion","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the topic of recursion to be particularly interesting, with many highlighting its connection to Computer Science and their own coding experiences. The use of string concatenation as an example of recursive definition was a major point of interest, with several students noting that it helped improve their understanding of the concept. Additionally, the ability to ask questions and explore the idea of using recursion to define functions and sequences was seen as a valuable aspect of the lecture.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of recursion that students found interesting, such as the connection to Computer Science, the string concatenation example, and the ability to ask questions, rather than making a general statement about the topic being ""interesting"".
* Try to eliminate redundant phrases, such as ""with many highlighting"" and ""with several students noting"", and instead use more concise language to convey the same information.
* Consider adding more specific details from the reflections, such as the mention of Hina's question about uncountable alphabets, to make the summary more vivid and engaging.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were particularly intrigued by the connection between recursion and Computer Science, citing its relevance to their coding experiences. The string concatenation example, which demonstrated recursive definition, stood out as a key takeaway, with several students noting improved understanding.

Universe set is kind of difficult to conceptualize, the tulle is a bit suspicious but I knew it from Python 
everything was pretty clear.
The Cartesian products and essentially everything in the last two slides was especially confusing. In general I often feel like the last couple slides of each lecture are squeezed in and not explained as clearly or slowly as the rest of the content. But this is usually corrected in the next lecture of for this week videos. 
 I was a bit unsure about exactly what Cartesian products were, but after asking a friend I got it cleared up. We learned a lot of terminology and definitions today, but none of it was too complicated.

 I was confused about ordered n-tuples and Cartesian products. They both covered rather quickly towards the end of class and I felt as though I didn't have time to process the information. Cartesian products are especially confusing because I'm enrolled in calc 1 at the same time as this class. I have yet to learn about anything in calc 1 that would support my understanding.

mathematical terms with integration","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Many students expressed confusion regarding the integration of magnetic fields, particularly when dealing with cross products and setting up the integral. Some struggled with determining the correct direction of the magnetic field when multiple fields interact, and others found it challenging to apply the right-hand rule. Additionally, students were unsure about how to set up the integral for circular wires and how to determine the bounds of integration. Some students also found the integration using the Biot-Savart law to be confusing, and a few were unsure about how to find values for the equation. Overall, students seemed to be struggling with the mathematical aspects of integration, particularly with cross products and setting up the integral.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Related to Integration:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining similar points, such as the struggles with cross products and setting up the integral, to create a more concise summary. For example, the original summary mentions ""dealing with cross products"" and ""setting up the integral"" separately, but these could be combined into a single point, such as ""struggling with the mathematical aspects of integration, particularly with cross products and setting up the integral"".
2. Remove redundant language, such as ""particularly when dealing with cross products and setting up the integral"", which is repeated in the original summary. This sentence could be removed without losing any important information.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced with integration, rather than just listing the topics they struggled with. For example, the original summary could be rephrased to say ""Students struggled to apply the right-hand rule and determine the correct direction of the magnetic field when multiple fields interact, and had difficulty setting up and integrating the equations for circular wires and complex magnetic field arrangements."" This rephrased summary is more concise and focused on the specific challenges students faced.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to apply the right-hand rule and determine the correct direction of the magnetic field when multiple fields interact, and had difficulty setting up and integrating the equations for circular wires and complex magnetic field arrangements.

 It was confusing to me how we found which circuits would produce the most or least current ",583,"Determining the amount of current
How does the higher current have a higher frequency
how to apply the equations for finding current in an RL circuit
I find knowing when current goes through an insulator to be confusing
yet the equation suggests that current is slowly disappaited
the function that defines current
deciding when to use the current switched on vs using the current switched off
tell when to use which equation for finding current
how we found which circuits would produce the most or least current","Here is the summary:

SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand various aspects of current, including finding direction using Lenz's law, applying equations to find current in RL circuits, and understanding the behavior of inductors in circuits. Many students were confused about the units of the Henry and how inductors affect current. Additionally, students found it challenging to distinguish between capacitors and inductors, and how they interact in series and parallel circuits.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider focusing more specifically on the concept of current and its relationship to inductors, rather than mentioning other topics like capacitors and resistors. This would allow for a more concise and targeted summary.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to use more precise language, such as ""students struggled to apply Lenz's law to find the direction of current"" instead of ""finding direction using Lenz's law"". This would make the summary more clear and concise.
3. Consider breaking the summary into two or three separate paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of current that students struggled with. This would allow for a more detailed and nuanced summary that highlights the specific challenges students faced.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of current, particularly in relation to inductors.
