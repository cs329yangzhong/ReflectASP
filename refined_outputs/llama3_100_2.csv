SUMMARY: Students had varying levels of understanding regarding integrals, with some struggling to set up problems and choose appropriate bounds. Many students found it challenging to apply integrals to find potential energy, particularly when dealing with zero bounds or partial derivatives. Some students also had difficulty distinguishing between voltage, potential energy, and electric potential. Additionally, there was a desire for more examples and explanations, especially regarding the setup of problems, and more clarification on topics such as dipoles and conductors.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ",32,"I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could’ve been more in-depth.
I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense.

Summary: Students generally found the in-class questions to be well-explained and helpful for understanding the concepts of Coulomb's Law and Shell Theorems. However, some students struggled with the pace of the lecture, feeling that they did not have enough time to fully understand the material. Additionally, some students found the diagrams and application of Coulomb's Law to be confusing, particularly with the concept of r-value. The breakout rooms were seen as a helpful tool for understanding the material, but some students felt that they did not always participate effectively.

Suggestions:

1. Consider providing more time for students to work on the in-class problems, allowing them to fully understand the material before moving on to the next topic. This could help alleviate some of the confusion and frustration that students experienced with the pace of the lecture.
2. Provide additional support for students who are struggling with the diagrams and application of Coulomb's Law, such as providing additional examples or practice problems. This could help students better understand the concept of r-value and how it relates to the law.
3. Consider providing more guidance on how to effectively participate in the breakout rooms, such as providing clear instructions or prompts for discussion. This could help ensure that all students are able to participate effectively and get the most out of the breakout rooms.","REFINED SUMMARY:

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. Thisis my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of thisopportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it iseasy to ask questions and meet with the TA’s in their office hours.

Overall, TopHat was seen as a valuable tool for active learning and engagement in the lecture.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

Summary: Students found the concept of free body diagrams challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces, tensions, and pulleys. They struggled to understand why tension is represented as a positive force and how to set up free body diagrams for complex systems, such as multiple objects interacting with each other. The concept of doubling tension forces in pulleys was also a common point of confusion.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing clear explanations for why tension is represented as a positive force, and provide examples to illustrate this concept. This could help students better understand the underlying physics and reduce confusion.
2. Provide more guidance on how to set up free body diagrams for complex systems, such as multiple objects interacting with each other. This could include step-by-step instructions or examples of how to break down the system into smaller components and identify the relevant forces.
3. Emphasize the importance of understanding the relationships between the forces in a system, including internal forces and friction. This could help students better understand how to apply free body diagrams to solve problems and make connections between different concepts.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found free body diagrams (FBDs) challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces, tensions, and pulleys.

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of static friction to be particularly interesting, with many highlighting the idea that surface area does not affect the force required for an object to slide off a surface. They also appreciated the explanation of how cold welds between two surfaces impact friction, and the concept of static friction being proportional to the normal force.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific examples and practice problems that students found most engaging, such as the sandpaper block and the sled being pushed and pulled, to further illustrate the concept of static friction.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between normal force and static friction, as many students found this concept to be particularly interesting and relevant.
3. Highlight the interactive nature of the lecture, including the top hat questions and breakout room discussions, as these activities helped students develop a deeper understanding of static friction and its applications.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of static friction to be particularly interesting, with many highlighting the idea that surface area does not affect the force required for an object to slide off a surface.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Normal Force
SUMMARY: Students found the concept of normal force to be a crucial aspect of understanding friction, with many mentioning its relationship to the coefficient of friction and its impact on the force of friction. They appreciated the explanation of cold welds and atomic interactions that occur on the molecular level, which affect the normal force and ultimately the force of friction. Many students enjoyed the interactive and conceptual top hat questions, which helped to solidify their understanding of normal force and its role in friction problems.

2. Emphasize the students' appreciation for the interactive and conceptual top hat questions, as these seem to have been particularly effective in helping students understand the concept of normal force. This could be done by adding more detail about the types of questions that were asked and how they helped students to solidify their understanding.
3. Consider adding more specific examples or quotes from the students' reflections to support the summary. For example, the summary could include a quote from a student about the importance of understanding normal force in solving friction problems, or a specific example of how normal force was applied in a real-life scenario. This would help to make the summary more concrete and engaging for the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students gained a deeper understanding of the concept of normal force, recognizing its crucial role in determining the force of friction.

It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.

 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

Relative Motion! I’m aware that it’s mainly vector addition /subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add /subtract.","Here is the summary:

Relative motion was a challenging concept for many students, with difficulties arising from understanding when to add or subtract vectors. The monkey and bullet example was a common source of confusion, and students struggled to conceptualize relative speed, particularly when dealing with horizontal initial velocities. Students also found the use of subscripts and variables in relative motion equations confusing.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining the first two sentences into one: ""Students found relative motion challenging, particularly when it came to understanding vector addition and subtraction, with the monkey and bullet example being a common source of confusion.""
2. Consider rephrasing the third sentence to focus more specifically on the concept of relative speed: ""Students struggled to conceptualize relative speed, particularly when dealing with horizontal initial velocities, which led to difficulties in applying relative motion concepts.""
3. Instead of mentioning ""subscripts and variables in relative motion equations"" as a general point of confusion, consider specifying which specific aspects of the equations were confusing to students, such as the use of delta notation or the distinction between initial and final velocities.","REFINED SUMMARY: Relative motion was a challenging concept for many students, particularly when it came to understanding when to add or subtract vectors.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer.

**Summary:** Students generally found the lecture on Vector Math to be clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. The majority of students understood the concept of adding and subtracting vectors, including the importance of unit vectors and the right-hand rule. However, some students struggled with determining when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in word problems. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the use of negative vectors and the need to add 180 degrees in certain cases. Students also appreciated the use of visual aids, such as graphs and diagrams, to help illustrate the concepts. Overall, students were generally satisfied with the lecture and felt that it provided a solid foundation for further learning.

**Suggestions:**

1. Clarify the concept of when to add or subtract vectors in word problems, providing more examples and practice problems to help students understand the nuances of vector addition and subtraction.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on the use of negative vectors and the need to add 180 degrees in certain cases, including examples and practice problems to help students solidify their understanding.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me.

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!

 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it.

However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.

Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took awayfrom the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we allget used to the format.
I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling.
The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did.
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning ofthe lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after Iused it for the first question I got the hang of it.
For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract.
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the TopHat Question:

**Summary:** Students generally found the TopHat Question to be challenging, with some struggling to determine when to add or subtract vectors. Many students reported feeling uncertain about how to approach the question, and some felt that the format of the question was unclear. However, others found the question to be helpful in reinforcing their understanding of vector addition and subtraction.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Provide more guidance on word problem-solving**: Many students struggled with determining when to add or subtract vectors in word problems. Providing more guidance on how to approach these types of problems could help students feel more confident in their ability to solve them.
2. **Offer more examples and practice problems**: Students who struggled with the TopHat Question may have benefited from additional examples and practice problems to help reinforce their understanding of vector addition and subtraction.
3. **Emphasize the importance of reading the question carefully**: Some students reported feeling uncertain about how to approach the TopHat Question because they didn't fully understand what was being asked. Emphasizing the importance of reading the question carefully and understanding what is being asked could help students feel more confident in their ability to answer the question.","REFINED SUMMARY:

Students generally found the TopHat Question challenging, with some struggling to determine when to add or subtract vectors.

The summary could be rewritten to emphasize this theme, highlighting how the students appreciated the real-life applications of pulleys and tension in the context of free body diagrams.
2. Remove redundant information: Some of the points mentioned in the original summary, such as the ""recipe"" for drawing FBDs and the ability to turn external forces into internal forces, are not directly related to the Top Hat questions. These points could be removed to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.
3. Use more specific language: The original summary uses general phrases such as ""many students enjoyed"" and ""students appreciated."" Instead, the summary could use more specific language to describe the students' reactions, such as ""most students found the pulley and tension-related questions to be the most interesting"" or ""students were fascinated by the concept of tension being the same between multiple objects.""

93,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with frictional forces and combining forces on multiple blocks. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially the ones involving blocks on top of each other or on a frictionless surface. Some students also found it difficult to determine the correct forces and equations to use in these scenarios. Additionally, there was some confusion about the difference between kinetic and static friction, as well as the concept of fs,max and its purpose.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with frictional forces and combining forces on multiple blocks. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially the ones involving blocks on top of each other or on a frictionless surface. Some students also found it difficult to determine the correct forces and equations to use in these scenarios. Additionally, there was some confusion about the difference between kinetic and static friction, as well as the concept of fs,max and its purpose.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of two blocks/forces/systems that students found challenging, such as combining forces on multiple blocks, dealing with frictional forces, and determining the correct forces and equations to use. This will help to provide a more targeted summary that highlights the key areas of difficulty.
2. Consider rephrasing some of the sentences to make them more concise and clear. For example, instead of saying ""Many students struggled with the top hat questions"", you could say ""Students found the top hat questions, particularly those involving blocks on top of each other or on a frictionless surface, to be challenging"".
3. Emphasize the importance of practice and repetition in mastering the concept of two blocks/forces/systems. This could be done by mentioning that students need to practice combining forces and solving problems involving multiple blocks to become more comfortable with the concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when combining forces on multiple blocks and dealing with frictional forces.

 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

The students generally understood the concept of Free Body Diagrams, but struggled with applying it to more complex problems, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and friction. Many students found the top hat questions challenging, especially those involving stacked blocks or frictionless surfaces. Some students also expressed difficulty in understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as the concept of the coefficient of friction.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex problems into simpler components, and using the concept of Free Body Diagrams to identify and analyze individual forces acting on each component. This could help students better understand how to apply the concept to more complex problems.
2. Provide more examples of static friction and how to use the coefficient of friction in problem-solving, as students expressed a desire for more practice in this area. This could include providing additional practice problems or examples in the next lecture.
3. Consider providing more detailed explanations of the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as the concept of the coefficient of friction. This could help students better understand these concepts and how to apply them in problem-solving.","Here is the refined summary:

The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of centripetal force to be the most challenging aspect of today's lecture on circular motion. Many students struggled to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle and how to derive the equations for circular motion. The application of centripetal force in different scenarios, such as the example of the skydiver entering the ocean, was also a source of confusion. Additionally, students had difficulty with the concept of terminal velocity and how it changes when an object enters or exits different substances.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more concrete examples and explanations for centripetal force, such as the example of a ball on a string moving in a circular path, to help students better understand its application in different scenarios.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the units for the drag force formula and provide more guidance on how to apply it in different situations.
3. Consider providing more visual aids, such as diagrams or animations, to help students visualize the concept of terminal velocity and how it changes when an object enters or exits different substances.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of centripetal force to be the most challenging aspect of today's lecture on circular motion, struggling to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle and how to derive the equations for circular motion.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the explanation of weighted decision matrices (WDM) clear, but struggled with distinguishing between criteria and metrics, particularly in terms of what to include in each section. Some students were also unclear about how to choose criteria, determine metrics, and fill out the WDM, leading to confusion during the in-class activity.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the key differences between criteria and metrics in future lectures to help students better understand the distinction. This could be done through visual aids, such as diagrams or charts, to help students visualize the relationship between the two.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to choose criteria and determine metrics, potentially through examples or case studies. This could help students better understand the practical application of WDM and reduce confusion during the in-class activity.
3. Emphasize the importance of clear and concise communication in the WDM, highlighting the need for students to carefully consider the language and formatting used in their matrices. This could help students avoid common pitfalls and produce more effective WDMs.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the explanation of weighted decision matrices (WDM) clear, but struggled with distinguishing between criteria and metrics, particularly in terms of what to include in each section. Many students were unclear about how to choose criteria, determine metrics, and fill out the WDM, leading to confusion during the in-class activity."
109,"SUMMARY: The in-class activity on the weighted decision matrix (WDM) was a source of confusion for many students. Some students found it unclear what parts of the template to fill out, while others struggled to distinguish between the criteria and metrics sections. Additionally, some students were unsure about how to choose their criteria and how to determine the specific numbers for the metrics. A few students also found the WDM concept itself to be confusing, particularly when it came to understanding how the numbers worked. However, many students appreciated the explanation of the WDM and were able to complete the activity with some guidance.",In-Class Activity or In-Class Assignment," nothing
when assignment 18 was supposed to be due
Nothing
Constraints versus metrics
it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.

 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing. 
 Everything is pretty clear 
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.

The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the new project to be clear and straightforward, with many stating that they did not find anything confusing. Some students did express confusion regarding the assignment 13, particularly with regards to the constraints and criteria, as well as the energy units and calculations. Additionally, a few students mentioned that they would have liked more information on how to approach the project and what is expected of them. Overall, the students seemed to appreciate the clarity of the lecture and the provided resources, but some areas of confusion remained regarding the assignment specifics.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary by focusing on the most prominent themes and eliminating repetitive statements. For example, the summary could be shortened to focus on the main areas of confusion (assignment 13, energy units, and calculations) and the students' appreciation for the clarity of the lecture.
2. Use more precise language to summarize the students' responses. For instance, instead of saying ""some students did express confusion,"" consider stating ""students struggled with understanding the constraints and criteria of assignment 13"" or ""students found the energy units and calculations unclear.""
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to provide a clearer direction for the students on how to approach the project and what is expected of them. This could help alleviate some of the confusion and provide a clearer roadmap for the students to follow.","REFINED SUMMARY:

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.

SUMMARY: Connection issues were a major source of confusion for many students during today's lecture. Several students reported experiencing difficulties connecting to Brightspace, which made it challenging to follow along with the class and submit assignments. Additionally, some students were unable to access the class for the first 30 minutes due to technical issues, causing them to feel lost and confused about what was expected of them. These connection issues not only disrupted the learning environment but also caused frustration and anxiety among students.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the two sentences that mention Brightspace and technical issues to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic. For example: ""Several students experienced difficulties connecting to Brightspace, which was further exacerbated by technical issues that prevented some students from accessing the class for the first 30 minutes.""
* Remove the phrase ""causing them to feel lost and confused about what was expected of them"" as it is not directly related to the connection issues and makes the summary slightly more vague.
* Consider rephrasing the last sentence to make it more concise and focused on the impact of connection issues on the students' learning experience. For example: ""These connection issues disrupted the learning environment and caused frustration and anxiety among students.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Connection issues were a major source of frustration for many students during today's lecture.

There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

I enjoyed brainstorming with my team about problems.","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the groupwork aspect of the lecture to be the most engaging and interesting part of the class. They enjoyed having the time to work on the assignment with their teams, citing the motivation and collaboration that came with being in class together. Many students appreciated the hands-on approach to problem scoping and idea generation, finding it helpful to view the problem from different perspectives. The flexibility and autonomy of the design project, allowing students to come up with their own solutions, was also a highlight for many. Overall, the students were excited to dive into the project and explore the design process.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of groupwork that students found engaging, such as the collaboration and motivation that came with working together in class. This could be achieved by rephrasing the summary to highlight the benefits of groupwork, such as ""Students appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with their peers in class, finding that the shared experience boosted their motivation and creativity.""
2. Emphasize the importance of problem scoping and idea generation in the groupwork process. This could be done by rephrasing the summary to focus on the specific skills or techniques that students found most helpful, such as ""Students enjoyed the hands-on approach to problem scoping and idea generation, finding it valuable to consider different perspectives and approaches.""
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the topic of groupwork. For example, instead of mentioning the ""flexibility and autonomy"" of the design project, the summary could simply state that ""Students appreciated the freedom to come up with their own solutions and explore the design process.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the groupwork aspect of the lecture to be the most engaging, citing the motivation and collaboration that came with working together in class.

SUMMARY: Students were generally unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, with some expressing confusion about the source of feedback and how to incorporate it into their work. Many students also felt that the expectations for the assignment were not clearly communicated, leading to uncertainty about what was required. Some students appreciated the clarification provided by the TA at the end of the class, but others still felt that the feedback process was unclear.

And here are 3 suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points (confusion about feedback process and unclear expectations) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Students were unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, which was further complicated by unclear expectations about what was required.""
2. Emphasize the specific aspects of the feedback process that caused confusion, such as ""source of feedback"" and ""how to incorporate it into their work"", to provide more clarity on the topic.
3. Consider adding a sentence to highlight the positive aspect of the TA's clarification, such as ""However, some students appreciated the clarification provided by the TA at the end of the class, which helped to alleviate some of the confusion."" This would provide a more balanced view of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were unclear about the feedback process for Assignment 17, which was further complicated by unclear expectations about what was required.

However, some students expressed confusion regarding the laminar approach, particularly in its application to assignment A10. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values in regression analysis.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the specific points of confusion, such as the laminar approach and the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values, to provide more targeted support and clarification.
2. Consider providing more concrete examples or visual aids to help students understand the concept of regression and its application to assignment A10.

I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.

This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more as well as more specifics on the exam next week.
We could have used some more information about how to prepare for theexam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can useto study.","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with no major points of confusion. However, some students mentioned that the pace of the lecture was a bit fast, which made it difficult for them to fully understand certain concepts, such as converting units and calculating pressure head. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the exam instructions and expectations, particularly regarding the use of Excel for the in-class quiz. Overall, students seemed to appreciate the review of the quiz and test, and most reported feeling prepared for the exam.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Exam Prep:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the two main points about the pace of the lecture and the difficulty in understanding certain concepts into a single sentence, such as: ""Some students found the lecture pace a bit fast, which made it challenging to fully grasp certain concepts, such as converting units and calculating pressure head.""
* Remove the sentence ""Overall, students seemed to appreciate the review of the quiz and test, and most reported feeling prepared for the exam"" as it is not directly related to Exam Prep and is more of a general statement.
* Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Additionally, a few students were unclear about the exam instructions and expectations, particularly regarding the use of Excel for the in-class quiz"" to make it more concise and focused on Exam Prep, such as: ""Some students were unclear about exam instructions and expectations, particularly regarding the use of Excel for the in-class quiz.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with no major points of confusion.

 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.
Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confusedif we need responses from people or if we should generate themourselves.

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear and straightforward, with only a few minor areas of confusion. The main sources of confusion were related to the In-Class Assignment, specifically the directions and expectations, as well as the project deliverables, particularly the problem statement and what was required for assignment 16. Some students also mentioned confusion regarding the stakeholder aspect of the project and how to gather information from them.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary, making it more concise and focused on the topic Deliverables:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main sources of confusion (In-Class Assignment and project deliverables) into a single sentence, such as: ""The majority of students found the lecture clear, but some were confused about the In-Class Assignment directions and expectations, as well as the project deliverables, particularly the problem statement and assignment 16 requirements.""
2. Remove the mention of ""a few minor areas of confusion"" as it's not specific to the topic of Deliverables and doesn't add much value to the summary. Instead, focus on the main points of confusion related to Deliverables.
3. Consider rephrasing the last sentence to make it more concise and focused on the topic, such as: ""Some students were also unclear about how to gather information from stakeholders, which was a key aspect of the project deliverables.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear, but some were confused about the project deliverables, particularly the problem statement and assignment 16 requirements. Specifically, students struggled with understanding what was required for the assignment, including the stakeholder aspect and how to gather information from them."

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.

SUMMARY: Students found the calculations in today's lecture to be challenging, particularly with regards to the in-class assignment. Many students were unsure about which variables to use and how to apply the formulas, leading to confusion and frustration. Some students also felt that the instructions for the assignment were unclear, leading to difficulties in completing the task.

Suggestions:

1. Consider breaking down the in-class assignment into smaller, more manageable parts to help students better understand the calculations and formulas. This could include providing more explicit instructions and examples to follow.
2. Provide more guidance on how to apply the formulas and which variables to use, either through additional examples or by having TAs available to assist students during the in-class activity.
3. Consider providing more explicit instructions on the laminar approach and how to derive mathematical models from the given data, as this seemed to be a source of confusion for many students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the calculations in today's lecture challenging, particularly with regards to the in-class assignment.

 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams

The Laminar Approach was a challenging concept for many students, who found it difficult to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models. Some students were unclear about the instructions for in-class activities, including the use of formulas and variables, and the need for simplification of diagrams. Additionally, students were unsure about the expectations for assignment 10, including the creation of mathematical models and the use of the laminar approach in Excel.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more clarification on how to apply the laminar approach to real-world problems, including more examples and step-by-step instructions.
2. Offer more guidance on how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models, including the use of formulas and variables.
3. Clarify the instructions for in-class activities, including the need for simplification of diagrams and the use of formulas and variables.
4. Provide more information on the expectations for assignment 10, including the creation of mathematical models and the use of the laminar approach in Excel.

 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Gasoline Density to be clear and easy to understand, with most reporting no confusion. However, some students were unsure about the relevance of including gasoline density in the in-class activity, and a few found the carbon footprint calculations to be confusing. Additionally, a few students wished for more detail on how to calculate CO2 emissions and the environmental impacts of solar panels.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific topic of Gasoline Density: While the original summary mentions that students found the lecture on Gasoline Density to be clear and easy to understand, it would be more effective to highlight specific points about the topic, such as how students understood the concept of gasoline density and its relevance to the in-class activity.
2. Use more concise language: The original summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise and focused on the topic. For example, instead of saying ""some students were unsure about the relevance of including gasoline density in the in-class activity"", it could simply say ""students questioned the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity"".
3. Highlight the most common theme: The original summary mentions that a few students found the carbon footprint calculations to be confusing, but it would be more effective to highlight the most common theme or issue that students had with the topic, such as the difficulty in understanding the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of Gasoline Density to be clear and easy to understand, with most reporting no confusion.

SUMMARY: The students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures to be insightful and engaging. Many students appreciated the real-world example of how negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in the project led to catastrophic consequences. The students were fascinated by the various factors that contributed to the failure, including oversights in engineering design, lack of communication, and shortcuts taken to save costs. They recognized the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives in engineering projects. The students also enjoyed working in groups to analyze the data and calculating the power generated by the reservoir. Overall, the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failures provided a valuable learning experience, highlighting the significance of attention to detail and responsible engineering practices.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failure that the students found most interesting, such as the oversights in engineering design, lack of communication, and shortcuts taken to save costs. This will help to make the summary more concise and targeted to the specific topic.
2. Remove the phrase ""Many students appreciated"" and instead use a more concise phrase to convey the same idea, such as ""Students were fascinated by the various factors that contributed to the failure"".
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""They recognized the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives in engineering projects"" to make it more concise and focused on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failure. For example, ""The students learned the importance of attention to detail and responsible engineering practices through the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failure"".","REFINED SUMMARY: The Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures captivated students, who were fascinated by the oversights in design, lack of communication, and shortcuts taken to save costs that led to catastrophic consequences.

Overall, students would benefit from more detailed explanations and examples to clarify these concepts.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.

 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.

SUMMARY: The students found the topic of carbon footprints to be engaging and interesting, particularly the discussion on design trade-offs and the calculation of their own carbon emissions. Many students were surprised by the significant amount of CO2 emissions produced by their vehicles, with some noting that it was a ""wake-up call"" to be more mindful of their environmental impact. The in-class activity on calculating carbon emissions was also a highlight, with students appreciating the hands-on approach to learning. Additionally, the connection between carbon footprints and engineering was emphasized, with students recognizing the importance of considering environmental factors in their projects. Overall, the topic sparked a sense of awareness and responsibility among the students, encouraging them to think critically about their impact on the environment.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary by removing redundant phrases and focusing on the most important points. For example, the phrase ""particularly the discussion on design trade-offs and the calculation of their own carbon emissions"" could be removed, as it is implied by the rest of the summary.
2. Emphasize the students' reactions and emotions more explicitly. For example, instead of saying ""many students were surprised by the significant amount of CO2 emissions produced by their vehicles"", say ""students were shocked and surprised by the significant amount of CO2 emissions produced by their vehicles, with some noting it was a 'wake-up call' to be more mindful of their environmental impact"".
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Overall, the topic sparked a sense of awareness and responsibility among the students, encouraging them to think critically about their impact on the environment"" to make it more concise and impactful. For example, ""The topic instilled a sense of responsibility and awareness among students, prompting them to re-examine their environmental impact"".","REFINED SUMMARY: The students found the topic of carbon footprints engaging and thought-provoking, with many being shocked and surprised by the significant amount of CO2 emissions produced by their vehicles.

SUMMARY: Students had varying levels of clarity regarding assignment details, with some finding it confusing to understand the expectations for each assignment, particularly Assignment 8. Many students felt that the instructions were unclear or lacked sufficient detail, leading to confusion and frustration. Some students also struggled with understanding how to handle missing data in Excel and how to apply probability and z-scores to real-world scenarios. Additionally, students felt that the organization of assignments in Brightspace was unclear, making it difficult to find the correct materials and instructions. Overall, students requested more detailed explanations and examples to help them better understand the assignments and complete them successfully.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.

I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Skittles Example:

The Skittles Example was a topic of confusion for many students, with several students expressing difficulty in understanding how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Some students also found the concept of z-scores and their relationship to probability confusing, and would have appreciated more practice and examples to help solidify their understanding.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions on how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, and offer additional examples to help students understand the process.
2. Offer more practice problems and examples to help students solidify their understanding of z-scores and their relationship to probability.
3. Provide more detailed instructions and explanations for the in-class activity and assignment, to help students understand the expectations and purpose of the activity.
4. Consider providing additional resources or support for students who are struggling with the concept of z-scores and probability, such as additional practice problems or one-on-one support from the instructor or TA.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Skittles Example was a source of confusion for many students, with several students struggling to understand how to convert the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Additionally, the concept of z-scores and their relationship to probability was unclear for some students, who would have benefited from more practice and examples to solidify their understanding. Furthermore, students were unclear about the purpose and expectations of the in-class activity and assignment, highlighting the need for more detailed instructions and explanations."

 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16,because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due inone day.
I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholderfrom a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by theprofessor's explanation

The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Clients, Users, and Stakeholders:

Summary: Students generally found the discussion on Clients, Users, and Stakeholders to be clear and straightforward, with most reporting that there was nothing confusing or unclear. However, some students expressed confusion regarding the distinction between clients and users, as well as the role of stakeholders in the project. Additionally, there was some uncertainty about the scope of the project and the expectations for the first milestone.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the distinction between clients and users: The students' reflections suggest that there was some confusion about the difference between clients and users. Providing a clear definition and explanation of these terms, as well as examples of each, could help to alleviate this confusion.
2. Provide more guidance on the role of stakeholders: Similarly, students were unclear about the role of stakeholders in the project. Providing more information on how stakeholders fit into the project and how they can be incorporated into the design process could be helpful.
3. Offer more detail on the project scope and expectations: Students were uncertain about the scope of the project and the expectations for the first milestone. Providing more information on what is expected for the first milestone and how it fits into the larger project could help to alleviate this uncertainty.
4. Prioritize tasks: Students felt that the workload for the assignment was unexpectedly large and would benefit from more guidance on how to prioritize tasks. Providing tips on how to manage time and prioritize tasks could be helpful.","Here is a revised summary:

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
 Everything :)
 I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
 I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.

 I think it's interesting to learn about climate change and what we can do as engineers to prevent it from getting worse.
 The equation and class activity for car mileage
 Corollas have really good MPGs.
 That our cars generate a los of co2.
 It was interesting to learn about and calculate co2 emissions for a car
 Carbon footprint
 I found it interesting to go over the Code of Conduct from the beginning of the year and work more on the project with my groups.
 The site on carbon footprints.
 Calculating the environmental impact of my car in g CO2 per mile was interesting.
 the idea of trade off
 I enjoyed calculating the carbon footprint of my car. It was also interesting to observe what actions impact our climate.
 CO2 emissions calculator. Also got some good work done on the assignment
 Calculating carbon footprint of our cars
 I found it interesting the different costs we calculated in our assignment 
 Trade off designs were also interesting because they introduced a new idea to us that sounds like a good tool to use.
 calculating carbon emission for cars.
 How much carbon dioxide was emitted from natural gases. 
 finding my carbon footprint
 I found all the information on carbon footprints very interesting. 
 The discussion of design trade offs was very interesting to me. Providing examples as well as the importance of them was a topic that very much appealed to me.
 I found the c02 emissions of our cars and the associated calculations interesting
 I found the striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming very interesting
 I found the photos that were shown on climate change to be really interesting, they effectively show the large influence of global warming.",408,"It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety.
I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
global warming website to show the changes over time
It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts
I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
I like the idea of talking about renewable energy’s I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight
I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I’m glad it was covered in today’s class period.

The students found the topic of climate change and carbon footprints to be engaging and informative. Many students were surprised to learn about the significant amount of CO2 emissions produced by their own vehicles, with some mentioning that it was an ""eye-opening"" experience. The discussion on design trade-offs was also a highlight, with students appreciating the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of climate change, rather than including general comments about the class. For example, the summary could start with ""The students learned about the significant impact of climate change on the environment, with many being surprised to discover the amount of CO2 emissions produced by their own vehicles.""
2. Emphasize the students' reactions to the topic, such as their surprise, interest, and engagement. This could be done by using more vivid language and incorporating quotes from the students' reflections.
3. Consider breaking the summary into two or three paragraphs to make it easier to follow and more concise.","REFINED SUMMARY:

The students were captivated by the topic of climate change, with many expressing surprise and interest in learning about the significant impact of their daily actions on the environment. The revelation that their own vehicles produce a substantial amount of CO2 emissions, with some cars emitting up to 260 grams per mile, was a particular eye-opener. The discussion on design trade-offs was also a highlight, as students appreciated the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions. The in-class activity where students calculated their own carbon footprint was a popular topic, with many finding it fascinating to see the impact of their daily actions on the environment. Overall, the students were engaged and interested in learning about the environmental impact of their daily lives and the role that engineers play in addressing climate change."

Some students also found it challenging to determine how to test their designs on a virtual platform, and wished for more clarification on the testing procedure and experiment design. Additionally, students were unclear about the resources available for prototyping and testing, and how to overcome limitations such as lack of access to materials.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.

I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally.
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes.
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.

Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.

The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently.

I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None

1. Consider condensing the summary by focusing on the most common points of confusion and eliminating repetitive language. For example, instead of mentioning ""some students"" multiple times, you could simply state ""many students found the instructions unclear"" and then provide specific examples.
2. Emphasize the specific aspects of Assignment 17 that caused confusion, such as the extent of the assignment, functional decomposition, and solution requirements. This will help the instructor understand the specific areas that need clarification.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight the positive aspects of the lecture and in-class activity, such as the clarity of the lecture and the helpfulness of the TAs. This will provide a more balanced summary and show that the students appreciated the instructor's efforts.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found Assignment 17 confusing, particularly regarding the extent of the assignment and what was expected for the in-class activity. Some students struggled with understanding the concept of functional decomposition and the type of solution necessary for the assignment. Additionally, the instructions were unclear, with some students unsure about the requirements and expectations. However, most students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the helpfulness of the TAs during the in-class activity, which helped to clarify some of the confusion."
233,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the in-class activity on pros and cons to be straightforward and easy to follow, with some minor difficulties in understanding the assignment requirements. A few students mentioned that they had trouble coming up with pros and cons for the coffee makers, particularly those who do not drink coffee. Some students also found the example used in class to be unclear, making it difficult to understand the concept. However, most students appreciated the in-class activity and found it helpful in generating ideas.",Pros and cons/in class activity,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
 The different steps to the final project 
 Something confusing in today's class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. 
 There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
 None
 I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
 I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. 
 I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.

The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project to work on with my team
 The most interesting part of today's class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project. 
 I did not realize that we had been slowly incorporating different aspects of design into our assignments 
 Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project 
 starting a new project was the most interesting today
 It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
 The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem. 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. 
 I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
 I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers. 
 Design issues as a whole
 I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
 I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.
 Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting 
 I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
 I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
 The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
 Something interesting in today's class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it. 
 The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
 I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
 The design problem was quite interesting.

 I found the designing interesting of this project interesting. I'm very excited to do this project.
 Not much was interesting in this class, we were confused by stuff most of the time.
 The whole project I thought was interesting.
 The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we're excited for the upcoming project. 
 Writing and combining 3 problem statements
 writing the problem statement
 It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
 I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don't repeat them. 
 I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.
 Trade off
 I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
 I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting 
 I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer 
 There wasn't anything very interesting today, maybe a different approach to the project explanation could help engage students.

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of non-tail recursive functions and the different ways to traverse a binary tree to be the most challenging topics in the lecture. They struggled with non-tail recursion examples, the concept of strong buffers, and the mechanics of tree traversals in code. Additionally, they found it difficult to understand the difference between tail and non-tail recursion.

And here are 3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points (non-tail recursive functions and tree traversals) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Students found the concepts of non-tail recursive functions and different tree traversals, particularly non-tail recursion examples and traversal mechanics, to be the most challenging topics in the lecture.""
2. Remove the phrase ""in the context of backtracking traversals"" as it is not explicitly mentioned in the reflections. The summary should focus on the main points mentioned by the students.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on assignment logistics clear, with some minor areas of confusion. Confusion arose from the process of finding maximum velocity, particularly with regards to graph interpretation and calculation. Additionally, students struggled with understanding the requirements for Milestone 1, including the need for references and the distinction between M1a and M1. Some students also found the team assignment structure and objectives unclear, and would have appreciated more clarification on these points. Overall, students were able to derive ideas for finding slopes and velocities, but needed more guidance on specific calculations and project structure.

And here are 3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific areas of confusion, such as ""finding maximum velocity"" and ""Milestone 1 requirements"", rather than using general phrases like ""some minor areas of confusion"". This would make the summary more concrete and actionable.
2. Emphasize the need for more guidance on specific calculations and project structure, as this was a common theme among students' reflections. This could be rephrased to ""Students would benefit from more detailed guidance on calculation procedures and project organization"".
3. Consider breaking the summary into two paragraphs, one focusing on the clarity of the lecture and one focusing on the areas of confusion. This would make the summary easier to follow and allow for a clearer distinction between the positive and negative aspects of the lecture.","REFINED SUMMARY:

SUMMARY: Students found the linearization models presented in class to be interesting and relevant to the project. They appreciated the discussion of different methods to linearize data, including the Lineweaver-Burk/double reciprocal approach, and how it allows for precise calculation of the Michaelis constant and maximum velocity. Students also enjoyed learning about the different benefits and downsides of various linearization methods and how they can be applied to their own project. Many students found the in-class activity to be engaging and helpful in understanding the concepts, and appreciated the opportunity to work with different linearization equations to find the slope-intercept form.

1. Consider focusing more on the specific linearization models discussed in class, such as the Lineweaver-Burk/double reciprocal approach, and less on the general sentiment of the students. For example, the summary could highlight the precision and accuracy of this approach in calculating the Michaelis constant and maximum velocity.
2. Remove the phrase ""and how it can be applied to their own project"" as it is not directly related to the topic of linearization models. The summary should focus solely on the topic of linearization models and the students' understanding of it.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Many students found the in-class activity to be engaging and helpful in understanding the concepts"" to something more specific, such as ""Students appreciated the hands-on approach of the in-class activity, which allowed them to work with different linearization equations and find the slope-intercept form.""

I like when Hina asks questions because they are very interesting and challenging at times. I found her question today about uncountable alphabets very fun to think about. 
I thought that the whole thing with concatenation of strings was really interesting because it applies directly to Computer Science.
The idea of using recursion to define functions, sequences, etc. is a topic I enjoy a lot. Personally I want to major in CS and I am already familiar with recursion in the context of a coding class. 
String examples off applying recursive definition definitely improved my understanding
I found recursion very interesting. To be honest I find it a lot easier to understand than strong induction and am looking forward to learning more about recursion

Summary: Students struggled to understand the concept of current and its relation to inductors, with many finding it challenging to determine the direction of current using Lenz's law and apply equations to find current in RL circuits. Additionally, students were confused about how inductors affect the current and voltage over time, and some had difficulty distinguishing between series and parallel connections for inductors.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing on the specific struggles students had with Lenz's law, such as the difficulty in setting up and using the integral, and providing additional examples or practice problems to help solidify this concept.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the behavior of inductors in circuits, including how they affect the current and voltage over time, and provide more visual aids or demonstrations to help students grasp this concept.
3. Provide more explicit guidance on how to apply the equations for finding current in RL circuits, and offer additional practice problems to help students become more comfortable with this process.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of current and its relation to inductors, particularly with determining the direction of current using Lenz's law and applying equations to find current in RL circuits.
