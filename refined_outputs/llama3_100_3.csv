Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ",32,"I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.

Summary: Students generally found the TopHat questions to be well-explained, but some felt that the time allocated for responses was insufficient, leading to rushed answers. A few students struggled with specific questions, such as the ratio of charges and the repelling particles, and appreciated the professor's clarification. Overall, students appreciated the interactive nature of the TopHat questions and the opportunity to work on problems in class.

Suggestions:

1. Consider providing more time for students to respond to TopHat questions to avoid rushed answers and allow for more thoughtful responses.
2. Provide additional clarification on specific questions that students struggled with, such as the ratio of charges and the repelling particles, to ensure that students fully understand the concepts.
3. Consider providing more context or background information on the topics being covered in the TopHat questions to help students better understand the concepts and make connections to the lecture material.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat questions to be well-explained, but some felt that the time allocated for responses was insufficient, leading to rushed answers.

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

Students appreciated the clear and concise explanations of vector addition and subtraction, and the emphasis on following a step-by-step process. Overall, students found the topic of Vector Addition to be well-explained and enjoyable to learn.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better. 
 using tophat was interesting
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
 The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
 I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
 I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures. 
 The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

SUMMARY: Students generally enjoyed the use of TopHat in the lecture, finding it engaging and interactive. Many appreciated the opportunity to work in small groups and collaborate on problems, which helped them stay focused and motivated. The use of TopHat also allowed students to receive immediate feedback and see how their peers approached the problems, which was a valuable learning experience. Some students mentioned that the TopHat questions helped them stay engaged and interested in the material, and that the format was more enjoyable than traditional lecture-style learning. Overall, the students found TopHat to be a useful tool for learning and appreciated the opportunity to apply what they learned in a practical way.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.

Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the conceptual problems related to tension forces:

Students found the conceptual problems involving tension forces to be challenging, particularly in understanding the direction of the forces and how they interact with each other. Many students struggled to visualize the tension forces in ropes and pulleys, and some found it difficult to apply Newton's laws to solve problems involving tension.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced with tension forces, such as ""Students struggled to visualize tension forces in ropes and pulleys"" instead of ""Students found the conceptual problems involving tension forces to be challenging"".
2. Emphasize the importance of providing more practice opportunities for students to work on different types of tension problems and more examples that illustrate the concept from different angles.
3. Highlight the need for more guidance on how to set up equations and solve problems involving tension forces, as some students felt that the explanations provided in class were helpful but others would have liked more time to work on the problems.","REFINED SUMMARY:

It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.

 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?

SUMMARY: The students' reflections on the dinosaur question reveal a range of challenges, from understanding the concept of acceleration in relative motion to applying kinematic formulas in complex scenarios. Many students found the dinosaur problem confusing, particularly when dealing with multiple objects and their respective directions of acceleration. Some students struggled with determining which kinematic equation to use, while others were unclear about the concept of negative and positive directions in acceleration. Additionally, a few students found the use of calculus and quadratic equations in the problem to be challenging. Overall, the students' responses indicate a need for further clarification on the application of kinematic formulas and the concept of acceleration in relative motion.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating repetitive language. For example, the phrase ""from understanding the concept of acceleration in relative motion to applying kinematic formulas in complex scenarios"" could be condensed to simply ""applying kinematic formulas in complex scenarios, particularly with multiple objects and directions of acceleration.""
2. Focus more specifically on the dinosaur question, rather than mentioning ""kinematic formulas"" and ""acceleration in relative motion"" in general. This would make the summary more relevant to the topic and help the instructor understand the students' specific challenges with the dinosaur problem.
3. Consider using more precise language to describe the students' challenges. Instead of saying ""many students found the dinosaur problem confusing,"" for example, you could say ""students struggled with determining which kinematic equation to use, and some were unclear about the concept of negative and positive directions in acceleration."" This would provide more specific information about the students' difficulties and help the instructor identify areas for improvement.","REFINED SUMMARY: The students' reflections on the dinosaur question reveal challenges in applying kinematic formulas to complex scenarios, particularly when dealing with multiple objects and their respective directions of acceleration.

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.

Students found relative motion to be a challenging concept, struggling with vector addition and subtraction, particularly when dealing with multiple reference frames. Many students were confused about when to add or subtract vectors, and some had difficulty understanding relative speed, especially when an object is launched from a moving platform. The monkey and bullet example was also a source of confusion, and students had trouble applying kinematic equations to relative motion problems.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of clearly labeling and distinguishing between different reference frames in relative motion problems. This could be done by providing more examples and practice problems that explicitly show how to assign and use different reference frames.
2. Provide more detailed explanations and examples of how to add and subtract vectors in relative motion, particularly when dealing with multiple reference frames. This could include step-by-step solutions to practice problems and additional examples that illustrate the process.
3. Offer more practice problems and examples that focus on applying kinematic equations to relative motion problems. This could help students become more comfortable with the concept and improve their ability to solve problems.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found relative motion to be a challenging concept, struggling with vector addition and subtraction, particularly when dealing with multiple reference frames.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors.

I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Vector Math:

The students generally found the lecture on Vector Math clear and easy to follow, with most students reporting no confusion or only minor issues. The topics that caused some confusion included the use of sin and cos, angle conversions, and subtracting vectors. Some students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and a few had trouble with the concept of unit vectors. Additionally, a few students found it difficult to visualize and draw vectors, particularly when subtracting them.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more examples and practice problems that illustrate the concept of subtracting vectors, particularly when the vectors are not in the same direction. This could help students better understand when to add or subtract vectors and how to visualize the resulting vector.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the concept of unit vectors and how they are used in vector math. This could include providing more examples and practice problems that demonstrate the use of unit vectors in different contexts.
3. Consider providing additional visual aids or diagrams to help students better understand how to draw and visualize vectors, particularly when subtracting them. This could include providing examples of how to use different colors or symbols to represent different vectors, or how to use arrows to indicate the direction of the vectors.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.

 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after.

I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",88,"Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end.
I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.
Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took awayfrom the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we allget used to the format.
I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling.
The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did.
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning ofthe lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after Iused it for the first question I got the hang of it.
For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract.
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the points about subtracting vectors and unit vectors into a single point, as they are related topics. For example, you could say that some students found it confusing to determine when to add or subtract vectors, and also struggled with understanding the purpose and application of unit vectors.
2. Emphasize the common thread among the students' comments, such as the importance of visual aids and group work in understanding the material. This could be highlighted in the summary to provide a more cohesive overview of the students' experiences.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to address the students' requests for more examples and practice with unit vectors. This could be phrased as a suggestion for future lectures or assignments, and would show that the instructor is taking the students' feedback into account.","REFINED SUMMARY: The students generally found the lecture on vector basics to be clear and easy to follow, with most students reporting that they did not find anything confusing. However, some students struggled with the concept of subtracting vectors, particularly when to add or subtract them, and how to determine the direction of the resultant vector. Additionally, some students found the use of unit vectors to be confusing, and would have liked more examples and practice with them. Despite these challenges, students appreciated the use of visual aids and group work, and felt that the lecture was well-organized and easy to follow."

1. Focus on the most prominent themes: While the original summary covers a wide range of topics, it may be beneficial to focus on the most prominent themes that emerged from the students' reflections. For example, the concept of tension and its application to real-life scenarios, such as pulley systems, seems to be a common thread throughout the students' responses. Emphasizing this theme could help to create a more cohesive and focused summary.

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and frictional forces. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially the ones involving frictionless surfaces and stacked blocks. Some students were confused about the concept of static and kinetic friction, and how to determine the maximum force of friction (fsmax). Additionally, students had difficulty understanding how to combine free body diagrams for multiple blocks and how to approach problems with multiple forces acting on a system.

 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex systems. They struggled with applying friction, especially static and kinetic friction, and determining the maximum force of friction (fs,max). Combining FBDs for multiple blocks or objects was also a point of confusion. Students appreciated the interactive lecture and exam questions, but need more practice and explanation on how to approach complex FBD problems.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more explicit examples of how to combine FBDs for multiple blocks or objects, highlighting the key steps and considerations for each scenario.
2. Clarify the concept of fs,max by providing more detailed explanations and examples of how to determine it, and how it differs from fs.
3. Emphasize the importance of understanding the type of friction (static or kinetic) required for each problem and provide more guidance on how to identify the correct type of friction to use.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex systems.

        Original Summary: Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Newton's Laws, focusing on the topic of tension:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of tension to be particularly interesting and engaging, with many noting its real-world applications and ease of understanding. They appreciated the use of relatable examples, such as the tug-of-war scenario, to illustrate the concept of tension being the same throughout a rope. The incorporation of free body diagrams and force pairs was also highlighted as a helpful tool for understanding tension and Newton's Laws. Additionally, students enjoyed the conceptual questions and problems that allowed them to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios, making the material more tangible and memorable.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the concept of tension, rather than mentioning other topics like free body diagrams and force pairs. This will help to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of Newton's Laws.
2. Emphasize the students' appreciation for the real-world applications of tension, as this seems to be a key takeaway for many students. You could rephrase the summary to highlight the ways in which tension is used in everyday life, and how this makes the concept more relatable and interesting.
3. Consider using more precise language to describe the concept of tension, such as ""the force that acts along the length of a stretched string or wire"" or ""the force that opposes the stretching or compressing of an object."" This will help to provide a clearer understanding of the concept for readers who may not be familiar with it.","Here is the refined summary:

I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities.

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of centripetal force to be the most challenging aspect of the lecture, with many struggling to understand why the acceleration vector points towards the center of the circle. Additionally, the application of centripetal force in different scenarios, such as the skydiver entering the ocean, was also a source of confusion. Some students also found the drag force equations and their units to be unclear, particularly when dealing with different densities and materials. Overall, students would have benefited from more examples and explanations to help solidify their understanding of circular motion and centripetal force.

It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn't class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
The most confusing part of today's class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
 I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose. 
 I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn't have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
 The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
 It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
 The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
 Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
 N/A
 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
 I don't think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing. 
 Everything is pretty clear 
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 Nothing was really confusing to me today. 
 WDM
 The decision matrix
 I'm confused on how we are supposed to test our prototypes
 How metrics were different than criteria 
 I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first.

* To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the confusion about the distinction between criteria and metrics, and the lack of explanation on how to determine the specific numbers for the metrics. This would reduce the number of sentences and make the summary more focused.
* Consider rephrasing some of the sentences to make them more concise and clear. For example, instead of saying ""The in-class activity on weighted decision matrices (WDM) was a source of confusion for many students,"" you could simply say ""Many students found the in-class activity on WDM confusing.""
* To make the summary more focused on the in-class activity, consider removing any sentences that discuss the instructor's explanation of weighted decision matrices, as this is not directly related to the in-class activity.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class activity on weighted decision matrices (WDM) confusing, particularly with regards to filling out the template and distinguishing between criteria and metrics. Some students also struggled with determining specific numbers for metrics and describing scores for criteria. However, once the concept was understood, the activity was considered straightforward."

SUMMARY: Students found the Bike Data topic fascinating, particularly the detailed projects and data collection methods used by CoGo Bike Share. Many students were intrigued by the vast amount of information that could be tracked from a single Excel file, including trip duration and other metrics. The problem statement and design scoping cycle were also highlighted as important and interesting aspects of the topic. Students enjoyed analyzing the data and making statements based on their findings, and appreciated the opportunity to work together in breakout rooms to share ideas and resolve issues. Overall, the Bike Data topic sparked curiosity and engagement among students, and many looked forward to exploring it further in future classes.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of the Bike Data that students found most interesting, such as the trip duration data or the problem statement, rather than generalizing that the topic as a whole was fascinating. This would make the summary more concise and targeted to the topic.
2. Remove the phrase ""Overall, the Bike Data topic sparked curiosity and engagement among students, and many looked forward to exploring it further in future classes."" as it is a general statement that doesn't add much value to the summary and could be removed without affecting the main points.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students enjoyed analyzing the data and making statements based on their findings, and appreciated the opportunity to work together in breakout rooms to share ideas and resolve issues."" to make it more concise and focused on the Bike Data topic, for example: ""Students enjoyed analyzing the Bike Data and making statements based on their findings, particularly in breakout rooms where they could share ideas and resolve issues.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were particularly intrigued by the trip duration data and problem statement in the Bike Data topic.

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the new project introduction to be clear and straightforward, with many stating that they did not find anything confusing. Some students expressed confusion regarding the project specifications, particularly the participation work and the rubric for assignment 13. Additionally, some students were unclear about the process of making graphs and the variables involved.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points of confusion (project specifications and graph-making variables) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Some students expressed confusion regarding the project specifications, including the participation work and rubric for assignment 13, as well as the process of making graphs and the variables involved.""
2. Remove the phrase ""with many stating that they did not find anything confusing"" as it is not adding much value to the summary and makes it seem repetitive.
3. Consider rephrasing the last sentence to make it more concise and focused on the topic. For example: ""Overall, students found the new project introduction to be well-executed, with most questions being answered properly.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the new project introduction to be clear and straightforward, with some expressing confusion regarding the project specifications, including the participation work and rubric for assignment 13, as well as the process of making graphs and the variables involved."

The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Exam and Exam Practice to be clear and straightforward, with most reporting no confusion or issues. However, some students were confused about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, which made it difficult to study. Additionally, the technical issues with Brightspace and WiFi connectivity caused some students to miss the beginning of the class or struggle to follow along, leading to some initial confusion.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points about the practice exam (lack of solution key and difficulty studying) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Some students were confused about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, which made it difficult for them to study and understand the material.""
2. Emphasize the impact of the technical issues on students' understanding and engagement, rather than just stating that they caused ""some initial confusion"". For example: ""The technical issues with Brightspace and WiFi connectivity disrupted the class and caused some students to miss the beginning or struggle to follow along, which may have affected their understanding of the material.""
3. Consider adding a sentence to highlight the overall positive tone of the students' reflections, such as: ""Despite the technical issues, most students found the lecture on Exam and Exam Practice to be clear and straightforward, indicating a strong foundation for their understanding of the material.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Despite the technical issues with Brightspace and WiFi connectivity, which disrupted the class and caused some students to miss the beginning or struggle to follow along, most students found the lecture on Exam and Exam Practice to be clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on midterm/exam to be clear and straightforward, with no major points of confusion. However, some students expressed difficulties with the in-class activity, citing discrepancies between the numbers presented on the slides and the actual calculations. Specifically, some students were confused about the value of grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline, with some slides showing different numbers.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific points of confusion that students experienced during the in-class activity, such as the discrepancies in the numbers presented on the slides. This could help to provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the students' experiences.
2. Consider adding more context to the summary by providing more information about the in-class activity and the calculations that students were asked to perform. This could help to clarify any confusion and provide a better understanding of the issues that students faced.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider combining some of the points into a single sentence or phrase. For example, instead of listing multiple sentences about the discrepancies in the numbers, consider summarizing it as ""some students were confused by the discrepancies between the numbers presented on the slides and the actual calculations.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on midterm/exam to be clear and straightforward, with no major points of confusion.

However, most students felt that the lecture provided a good introduction to the course and that they gained a good understanding of what to expect throughout the semester.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects andquizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know rememberwhat to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, soif more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might helpthose students.
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Shareproject will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the nextlecture.
he only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3.

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the feedback aspect of Assignment 17 (A17) to be confusing, with many expressing uncertainty about where the feedback was coming from and how to incorporate it into their work. Some students also mentioned that the feedback was not provided until the end of the class, which made it difficult to understand the expectations for the assignment.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the specific points of confusion, such as the timing of feedback provision and the uncertainty about where feedback was coming from, to provide a more detailed understanding of the students' concerns.
2. Emphasize the importance of providing clear guidance on how to use feedback to inform their work and what specific parts of the assignment require feedback to make it more concrete and actionable.
3. Consider adding a sentence to acknowledge the effort of the instructor, Jeff, in clarifying the confusion and providing additional support to students, to maintain a positive tone and emphasize the instructor's commitment to student understanding.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the feedback aspect of Assignment 17 (A17) to be confusing, particularly regarding the timing of feedback provision and the uncertainty about its origin.

1. Consider condensing the summary by removing repetitive phrases and focusing on the most salient points. For example, the phrase ""many students were surprised"" is repeated twice, and the sentence ""The interactive website that calculated the number of earths needed if everyone lived like them was a highlight"" could be condensed to simply ""The website's calculation of the number of earths needed if everyone lived like them was a highlight"".
2. Emphasize the key takeaway or main point of the topic, which is the impact of car CO2 emissions on the environment. The summary could be rephrased to focus more on this aspect, such as ""Students learned about the significant impact of car CO2 emissions on the environment and were surprised by the large amount of emissions produced by their own cars, even those with 'good gas mileage'"".
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to provide more context or depth to the summary. For example, the summary could mention how the topic of car CO2 emissions relates to the broader theme of climate change or sustainability, or how it fits into the course's overall curriculum.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were fascinated by the concept of calculating their own carbon footprints and learning about the significant impact of car CO2 emissions on the environment.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.

 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.

 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.

Overall, students generally felt well-prepared for the exam, but a few areas of clarification would have been beneficial.

And here are some suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific areas of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students were unclear about certain concepts, it would be more effective to provide specific examples of what those concepts are. For example, instead of saying ""how to convert units"", it could say ""converting units from one system to another was unclear to some students"".
2. Remove redundant phrases: The summary mentions that ""some students expressed uncertainty"" and ""a few students were unclear"" multiple times. This repetition can make the summary seem repetitive and less concise. Consider condensing this information into a single sentence or phrase.

Nothing was confusing about today's class or needed more explanation 
I really enjoyed today's class!!
I was confused by what the student answer sheet meant when it said that the memo gave us data of the volume of the reservoir as a function of time, and I saw no function
There was no in class activity so that was confusing because no one mentioned it. The exam instructions were also a bit confusing.
the flow rate chart was confusing 
 The instructions for what was going to be on the exam were a little bit confusing, I wish there would have been more detail.
 Nothing was confusing today
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused as to why we had so much time in studio time with very little explanation as to what the time was meant for. Also, I did not see how the slides connected with the project. When the teacher explained the pressure head, I was a little confused by what factors go into this. Is it just a height ? 
 I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir.
 I think the class was well explained today. 
 How to take exam
 This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more as well as more specifics on the exam next week.
 How to completely calculate the power
 nothing.
 The quiz modules did not show up at 3.
 It would have been nice to see the class slides on brightspace during lecture.

 Nothing seemed to be confusing at all in today's class!
 Nothing was confusing. We just sat in breakout rooms working on the projects.
 I didn't find anything confusing in class today.
 I thought how we calculate volumetric flow rate was a little bit confusing.
 How the excel will work for the in class quiz
 Everything seemed straight forward to me. If something seems unclear I will look at the slides or ask questions. 
 We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
 I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
 I didn't have any confusion in class today.
 After showing the slide on assignment 10, I know I did the models wrong but it wasn't explained how to do it correctly.
 I was confused as to whether there was an in-class participation assignment 
 There was nothing that confused me during class except for a small part of assignment 12 that my group worked on.

 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.
Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confusedif we need responses from people or if we should generate themourselves.

SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class assignment and problem statement confusing, particularly in regards to specific tasks and expectations. Students struggled to understand the scope of the assignment, with some being unclear about what was due for the project and others finding conflicting messages in different places. Students also needed guidance on how to complete certain parts of the assignment, such as finding information from stakeholders and filling out tables.

Suggestions:

1. Consider providing more explicit instructions and clear expectations for the in-class assignment and problem statement to reduce confusion. This could include providing a detailed outline of the tasks and expectations, as well as examples or demonstrations to help students understand the scope of the assignment.
2. Provide more guidance on how to find and gather information from stakeholders, as well as how to fill out tables and complete other parts of the assignment. This could include providing templates or examples, as well as offering additional support or resources for students who are struggling.
3. Consider providing more clarity on the scope of the assignment and what is expected for the project, particularly in regards to the deliverables. This could include providing a clear outline of the project's objectives, as well as specific requirements and expectations for each part of the assignment.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class assignment and problem statement confusing, particularly in regards to specific tasks and expectations.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.

SUMMARY: Students found the in-class calculations and assignments confusing, particularly the pressure head and power equation, as well as the instructions for assignment 10. Many students struggled to understand the formulas and variables, and needed clarification on how to approach the problems. Some students also had difficulty deriving the mathematical equations from the tables and creating the laminar approach models.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions for the in-class assignments, including clear explanations of the formulas and variables, and examples of how to approach the problems.
2. Offer additional support for students who are struggling to understand the formulas and variables, such as one-on-one tutoring or group work.
3. Provide more examples and practice problems to help students become more comfortable with the mathematical equations and how to derive them from the tables.
4. Consider providing a step-by-step guide on how to create the laminar approach models, including examples and illustrations.
5. Clarify the instructions for the in-class activity, including the diagram and labeling, to reduce confusion and ensure students understand what is expected of them.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the in-class calculations and assignments challenging, particularly the pressure head and power equation, as well as the instructions for assignment 10.

 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.

I’m confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Laminar Approach:

The Laminar Approach was a challenging concept for many students, with several students expressing confusion about how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models. Some students found the in-class activity and assignment instructions unclear, citing a lack of guidance on which variables to use and how to find them. Additionally, students would like to see more examples and explanations of the Laminar Approach and its application to real-world problems.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions and guidance on how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models using the Laminar Approach.
2. Offer more examples and explanations of the Laminar Approach and its application to real-world problems to help students better understand the concept.
3. Consider providing additional support and resources for students who are struggling to understand the Laminar Approach, such as additional practice problems or one-on-one tutoring.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Laminar Approach was a challenging concept for many students, with several students expressing confusion about how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models.

* Emphasize the common themes of confusion that emerged from the students' reflections, such as the challenges of applying prototyping to abstract ideas and creating prototypes without being in the same physical space. This would help to highlight the key areas that need further clarification.
* Consider adding more specific details from the students' reflections to support the points of confusion, such as the difficulty in using CAD software or the need for more guidance on testing prototypes. This would make the summary more informative and helpful for the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion around applying prototyping to abstract ideas, creating prototypes without being in the same physical space, and using CAD software.

 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class.

The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came

Some students found the discussion of the calculus formula for finding area to be confusing, while others appreciated the explanation of the z-score and its relationship to probability. There was also confusion regarding the use of z-scores in the calculus equation for area under the curve. Additionally, students struggled with filling in missing data in Excel and understanding how to apply probability to real-world scenarios.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more practice exercises and examples to help students solidify their understanding of the formulas, equations, and calculations covered in the lecture. This could include step-by-step solutions to problems, as well as opportunities for students to work on their own problems and receive feedback from the instructor or teaching assistant.
2. Offer additional support and resources for students who are struggling with the concepts, such as one-on-one tutoring or online resources. This could help to ensure that all students have a solid understanding of the material and can apply it to real-world scenarios.
3. Consider providing more context and background information on the formulas, equations, and calculations covered in the lecture. This could help to make the material more accessible and relevant to students' lives, and could also help to reduce confusion and frustration.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had mixed reactions to the formulas, equations, and calculations covered in today's lecture, with some finding the discussion of the calculus formula for finding area confusing and others appreciating the explanation of the z-score and its relationship to probability.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.

 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.

 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming

However, some students were confused about the distinction between clients and users, and how to identify and empathize with them. Students also struggled to understand how to incorporate stakeholders into the project and how to determine the criteria and constraints for the problem statement.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the distinction between clients and users by providing concrete examples and scenarios that illustrate the differences. This could include a more detailed explanation of how to identify and empathize with each group.
2. Provide more guidance on how to incorporate stakeholders into the project, including examples of how to identify and prioritize their needs and concerns.
3. Offer more detail on how to determine the criteria and constraints for the problem statement, including how to balance the needs of different stakeholders and how to prioritize the project's goals and objectives.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the discussion on Clients, Users, and Stakeholders to be clear and easy to follow.

FOCUSED TOPIC: CLimate Change
        Original Summary: Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Climate Change:

SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on climate change and its impact on the environment to be engaging and informative. Many were surprised to learn about the significant contribution of everyday activities, such as driving, to their personal carbon footprint. The calculation of their own carbon emissions, including that of their vehicles, was a highlight for many students. The concept of design trade-offs and the importance of considering environmental factors in engineering projects was also a key takeaway. The use of visual aids, such as images and websites, to illustrate the effects of climate change was found to be particularly effective in conveying the importance of the issue. Overall, students appreciated the integration of climate change into the course and its relevance to their future careers as engineers.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of climate change, rather than including general comments about the course or instructor. For example, the sentence ""The concept of design trade-offs and the importance of considering environmental factors in engineering projects was also a key takeaway"" could be removed, as it is not directly related to climate change.
2. Emphasize the surprising nature of the students' discoveries about their personal carbon footprint, as this seems to have been a significant takeaway for many students. For example, the sentence ""Many were surprised to learn about the significant contribution of everyday activities, such as driving, to their personal carbon footprint"" could be rephrased to focus more on the surprise and impact of this discovery.
3. Consider adding more specific details about the visual aids used to illustrate the effects of climate change, as these seemed to be particularly effective in conveying the importance of the issue. For example, the sentence ""The use of visual aids, such as images and websites, to illustrate the effects of climate change was found to be particularly effective in conveying the importance of the issue"" could be rephrased to provide more specific examples, such as ""The striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming were particularly effective in conveying the importance of the issue.""","Here is the refined summary:

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

2. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced, rather than simply stating that they found the section confusing. For example, instead of saying ""many students struggled to understand how to test their prototypes,"" say ""students struggled to test their prototypes, particularly when using CAD software, and were unsure about the level of detail required.""
3. Consider adding more specific examples or quotes from the students' reflections to support the summary. For example, instead of saying ""students were unsure about the level of detail required in their prototypes,"" quote a student who specifically mentioned this concern.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand how to test their prototypes, particularly when using CAD software, and were unsure about the level of detail required.

The in-class activity on environmental analysis was a topic of discussion among students, with some finding it clear and straightforward, while others were confused about the inclusion of density in the calculations and the relevance of the gasoline density to the current project. Some students also mentioned that the explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that engineers need to consider the effects of their developments on society.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas or phrases. For example, the two sentences about the in-class activity could be condensed into one sentence.
2. Consider focusing more on the specific points of confusion and less on the general tone of the discussion. For example, the summary could highlight the specific issues with the inclusion of density and the relevance of gasoline density to the project.
3. Consider using more precise language to describe the points of confusion.

This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.

However, some students struggled with understanding the requirements of Assignment 17, particularly the extent of the in-class assignment and the specific sections to be completed. Some students also found the functional decomposition and iteration parts of the assignment unclear.

Suggestions:

1. Consider providing more explicit guidance on the specific sections to be completed for Assignment 17, as some students found this unclear. This could be achieved by providing a clear outline or checklist of the required tasks.
2. Clarify the extent of the in-class assignment, including the number of pros and cons to be generated, to avoid confusion among students.

Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.

I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you’re doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one.","Here is a revised summary that focuses on the topic of Stakeholders/Clients:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of stakeholders and clients to be an important aspect of the design process, particularly in understanding the differences between novice and professional engineers when working with them. They appreciated the clarification on the role of stakeholders, clients, and end-users, and how they can change depending on the project's perspective. Many students enjoyed learning about problem scoping and its relation to the design process, and are excited to apply their knowledge to their own design project.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the key points about stakeholders and clients, such as the differences between novice and professional engineers, and the concept of stakeholders, clients, and end-users changing based on project perspective. This will make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.
2. Emphasize the students' excitement and interest in learning about stakeholders and clients, as this is a key takeaway from the reflections. This can be done by using more active verbs, such as ""engaged"" or ""enthusiastic"", to describe the students' reactions.
3. Consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students are excited to apply their knowledge of stakeholders and clients to their own design project"" as it is not directly related to the topic of stakeholders and clients.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the in-class activity and accompanying video on finding initial velocity to be clear, but had difficulties with the assignment logistics. Confusion arose from the similarity in names of assignments, unclear objectives and requirements for Milestone 1, and the need to provide references for the milestone. Additionally, students struggled with understanding how to calculate Vmax, finding the correct velocity, and reading graphs to determine velocity max. Some students also found the structure of the project and the need to provide multiple explanations for each step to be confusing.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the points about unclear objectives and requirements for Milestone 1 with the points about the need to provide references, as they seem to be related and can be addressed together in the summary.

* Emphasize the specific aspects of the assignment logistics that caused confusion, such as the similarity in names of assignments, to make the summary more focused and actionable.
* Consider removing the phrase ""Some students also found..."" and instead use a more concise way to convey the idea that not all students found the structure of the project and the need to provide multiple explanations to be confusing. For example: ""The structure of the project and the need to provide multiple explanations for each step were also a source of confusion for some students.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with assignment logistics, particularly with unclear objectives and requirements for Milestone 1, including the need to provide references.

The Right Hand Rule was a topic of confusion for many students, with several students expressing difficulty in understanding how to apply it to determine the direction of magnetic fields and forces. Students struggled with integrating the Biot-Savart law, particularly with setting up the integral and dealing with cross products. Some students were unsure about how to determine the direction of magnetic fields when multiple fields are present, or how to use the Right Hand Rule to find the direction of the magnetic field around a circular loop.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more examples of applying the Right Hand Rule to different scenarios, such as finding the direction of magnetic fields around a circular loop or determining the direction of magnetic forces. This could help students better understand how to apply the rule in different contexts.
2. Emphasize the importance of setting up the integral correctly when using the Biot-Savart law, and provide more guidance on how to deal with cross products. This could include providing step-by-step examples of how to set up the integral and how to simplify the resulting expression.
3. Consider providing more practice problems that involve finding the direction of magnetic fields when multiple fields are present, or finding the magnetic force when given velocity and current. This could help students build their confidence in applying the Right Hand Rule in more complex scenarios.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Right Hand Rule was a topic of confusion for many students, with difficulties in applying it to determine the direction of magnetic fields and forces.

SUMMARY: Students were generally confused about the application of Lenz's Law and the use of integrals in problems. Many struggled with understanding the units and concepts behind the Henry's law and the behavior of inductors in circuits. Additionally, students found it challenging to distinguish between the equations for current in RL circuits and to apply them correctly. Some students were also confused about the concept of simple harmonic oscillation and how it relates to inductors and capacitors. Furthermore, students struggled with understanding the graphs of voltage vs. time and how inductance affects the amplitude and wavelength.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more on the specific in-class problems that students found challenging, rather than general concepts. For example, the summary could mention that students struggled with setting up and using integrals in problems, or with distinguishing between the equations for current in RL circuits.
* Emphasize the specific areas where students were struggling, such as understanding the behavior of inductors in circuits, or applying Lenz's Law correctly. This could help the instructor identify areas to focus on in future lectures.
* Consider breaking the summary into smaller, more specific points, rather than presenting a long list of general concepts. For example, the summary could be broken down into sections on ""Inductor behavior"", ""RL circuit equations"", and ""Graphs of voltage vs. time"", each highlighting specific areas of confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with specific in-class problems, including setting up and using integrals, distinguishing between RL circuit equations, and understanding the behavior of inductors in circuits.
