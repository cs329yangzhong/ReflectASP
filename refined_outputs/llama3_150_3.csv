The students generally found the lecture on Shell Theorem and Coulomb's Law to be clear and well-explained, with many feeling that they understood the concepts well after the professor's explanations. However, some students struggled with the diagrams and visual representations, particularly with the Shell Theorem, and felt that the pace of the lecture was too fast. Additionally, some students found the concept of grounding and the Shell Theorem to be unclear, and were confused about the idea that a particle can have residual charge after being grounded. A few students also struggled with the math involved in simplifying problems and felt that the professor could have provided more conversions. Overall, while the lecture was well-received, there were some areas where students felt that more clarification and explanation were needed.",Shell Theorem/Coulomb's Law,"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school. I also like the visualization of graphs in general much more than vectors.",42,"Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see atwhat location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two differentaccelerations.

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules.

While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren't too hard but not too easy as well. 
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.
Surprised by the answer to the second question, I thought the lower block was just put in to confuse us
Calculating the coefficient of friction for sandpaper 
I found that learning how to set up the system and what masses are included is important to solving friction problems
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
 Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
 It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction. 
 The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
 I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we've been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting. 
 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames

 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of tension forces, particularly in complex problems involving multiple directions and forces. Many students found it challenging to visualize and apply the concept of tension, with some citing the salami question and the rope-pulling problem as examples of confusion. Some students also struggled with the direction of tension forces, finding it difficult to determine which direction the force was acting in.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating redundant phrases. For example, the first sentence could be rephrased to ""Students struggled to understand tension forces, particularly in complex problems involving multiple directions and forces.""
2. To focus more on the topic of tension problems, consider eliminating sentences that discuss other topics, such as free body diagrams or Newton's laws. This will help to make the summary more targeted and relevant to the focused topic.
3. Consider using more specific language to describe the students' struggles with tension forces. For example, instead of saying ""some students found it challenging to visualize and apply the concept of tension,"" you could say ""students struggled to identify the direction of tension forces and apply them correctly in complex problems.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand tension forces, particularly in complex problems involving multiple directions and forces.

Many students found the concept of reference frames, particularly inertial and non-inertial frames, challenging to grasp. Students struggled to visualize and apply phantom forces, which affect an object's motion relative to different reference frames. Additionally, drawing free body diagrams and labeling forces in the correct directions proved difficult, especially in complex problems. Students also found it challenging to connect Newton's Laws to equations and formulas, and would benefit from more practice and examples to solidify their understanding of reference frames and their impact on object motion."

 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting
 I enjoyed learning about terminal velocity and how to solve for it.
 I liked the terminal velocity stink bug example! That was cool to work through",73,"What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation.
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications.
How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force
the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and usethem together like done in the water/air plane jump problem.","Here is the original summary:

The students found the concept of drag force problems, particularly those involving terminal velocity, to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture. They appreciated the real-life applications of drag force, such as the example of jumping out of a plane and hitting the water, which highlighted the immense acceleration experienced. The students also enjoyed learning about centripetal force and its relation to circular motion, and how it can be used to solve problems involving uniform circular motion. Additionally, they found the free body diagrams and the concept of uniform centripetal motion to be interesting and useful. Overall, the students were engaged by the practical examples and real-life applications of drag force problems and centripetal motion.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific drag force problems: While the summary mentions that the students found drag force problems involving terminal velocity to be interesting, it would be more effective to highlight specific examples, such as the plane jump problem, to illustrate the concept.
2. Emphasize the connection between drag force and centripetal force: The summary mentions that the students enjoyed learning about centripetal force and its relation to circular motion, but it would be more effective to explicitly connect this to the concept of drag force and how it affects centripetal motion.
3. Use more concise language: The summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to focus on the most important points. For example, instead of saying ""the students found the concept of drag force problems, particularly those involving terminal velocity, to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture"", it could simply say ""the students found drag force problems, especially those involving terminal velocity, to be the most interesting"".","REFINED SUMMARY: The students found the drag force problems, particularly those involving terminal velocity, to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture.

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well

 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture.

Summary: Students struggled to understand the concept of relative motion, particularly in the context of the dinosaur problem, where they were unsure about how to determine the direction of acceleration for each dinosaur. Many students also found it challenging to decide which kinematic equation to use in a given situation. The concept of circular motion and the right-hand rule was a source of confusion for some students.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific aspects of relative motion that students struggled with, such as determining the direction of acceleration for each dinosaur. This would provide a more targeted summary of the students' reflections.
2. Consider breaking up the summary into smaller paragraphs or bullet points to make it easier to follow and understand. This would also allow for a more detailed summary of the students' reflections without overwhelming the reader.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing some of the general statements about students needing more practice and clarification. Instead, focus on the specific areas where students struggled and provide more targeted suggestions for improvement.","REFINED SUMMARY:

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

This could be achieved by providing more examples and exercises to help students understand the concept.
2. Use more visual aids, such as graphs and diagrams, to help students visualize the difference between average and instantaneous velocity. This could include using different colors or symbols to represent the two types of velocity, or using animations to show how the velocity changes over time.
3. Provide more practice problems that involve applying the concept of average vs. instantaneous velocity to real-world situations, such as problems involving multiple objects or circular motion.

 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.

 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
 Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.",85,"This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition

how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.","Here is the summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of relative motion to be the most challenging topic in today's lecture, with many struggling to understand when to add or subtract vectors. The monkey and bullet example was particularly confusing for some students, and a few students had difficulty with the concept of relative speed, especially when dealing with horizontal initial velocities. Additionally, students had trouble with the kinematic equations, particularly in situations where they needed to determine the direction of motion.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of Vectors and Directions, rather than mentioning relative motion as a whole. For example: ""Students struggled with the concept of adding and subtracting vectors in different directions, particularly in the context of relative motion.""
2. Emphasize the specific areas where students were struggling, such as the monkey and bullet example, and the concept of relative speed. This could help the instructor identify areas to focus on in future lectures.
3. Consider adding more detail about the kinematic equations and how students were struggling with them. This could help the instructor provide more targeted support and examples to help students understand these concepts better.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the concept of adding and subtracting vectors in different directions, particularly in the context of relative motion.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.

 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling.

 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!

 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",87,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and whichangles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)

SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on angles to be clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. Many struggled with understanding when to add or subtract angles, particularly with negative vectors. Some also found it challenging to visualize the direction of the resultant vector when adding or subtracting vectors.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the rules for adding and subtracting angles, particularly when dealing with negative vectors. Some students found it helpful to have a concrete example or visual aid to illustrate the concept.
2. Provide more practice problems or examples that involve adding and subtracting angles, especially with negative vectors. This would help students become more comfortable with the concept and build their confidence.
3. Emphasize the importance of visualizing the direction of the resultant vector when adding or subtracting vectors. This could be achieved by providing more diagrams or examples that illustrate the concept.","REFINED SUMMARY:

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors.

The pulley system and elevator problems stood out as particularly interesting, as they demonstrated the practical applications of forces and free body diagrams. Students appreciated the flexibility in drawing free body diagrams, allowing them to choose the coordinate system that best suited the problem. The concept of tension and how it can be affected by the acceleration of objects was also a topic of interest.

 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.

 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where.

 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs

Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture.

 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already

Terminal velocity was a challenging concept for many students, particularly when dealing with changes in density and the application of forces. Students found the example problems, such as the skydiver entering the ocean, confusing due to the multiple variables involved. Setting up the equation for terminal velocity was also a struggle, with some students feeling overwhelmed by the number of unknown variables. Additionally, students had difficulty conceptualizing the drag force and its impact on terminal velocity, particularly when dealing with different densities.

1. Emphasize the importance of simplifying the equation for terminal velocity by highlighting the key variables and their relationships. This could be done by breaking down the equation into smaller, more manageable parts and providing more examples of how to apply it to different scenarios.
2. Provide more practice problems that involve terminal velocity and drag force, with a focus on different densities and applications. This would allow students to become more comfortable with the concept and develop their problem-solving skills.
3. Consider using visual aids, such as graphs or diagrams, to help students visualize the concept of terminal velocity and its relationship to drag force. This could help students better understand the underlying physics and make the concept more accessible.","REFINED SUMMARY:

Terminal velocity was a challenging concept for many students, particularly when dealing with changes in density and the application of forces. Students struggled to set up the equation for terminal velocity, feeling overwhelmed by the number of unknown variables. Additionally, they found it difficult to conceptualize the drag force and its impact on terminal velocity, especially when dealing with different densities. The example problem involving the skydiver entering the ocean was particularly confusing due to the multiple variables involved. To improve understanding, it would be helpful to provide more practice problems that involve terminal velocity and drag force, with a focus on different densities and applications. Simplifying the equation for terminal velocity by highlighting key variables and relationships could also aid in student comprehension. Visual aids, such as graphs or diagrams, could also be used to help students visualize the concept and its relationship to drag force."

 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph.

 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.

SUMMARY: Students found the topic of histograms and graphs to be engaging and informative. Many students appreciated the hands-on experience of creating and editing histograms in Excel, and enjoyed learning about the different types of graphs and when to use them. The concept of bin size and number of bins was also a topic of interest, as was the ability to compare two sets of data with one graph. Students enjoyed the breakout room discussions and appreciated the opportunity to work with their peers.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence. For example, the first sentence could be rephrased to ""Students found the topic of histograms and graphs engaging and informative, and appreciated the hands-on experience of creating and editing histograms in Excel.""
2. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of histograms and graphs that students found interesting, rather than simply stating that they found the topic engaging and informative. For example, the summary could highlight the specific concepts of bin size and number of bins, or the ability to compare two sets of data with one graph.
3. Consider adding more specific quotes or examples from the student reflections to support the summary. This could help to make the summary more concrete and specific, and provide more insight into what students found interesting or challenging about the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the topic of histograms and graphs to be engaging and informative, particularly the hands-on experience of creating and editing histograms in Excel.

1. Consider combining the two main points (most students found the lecture clear and a few students requested more details) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""The students generally found today's lecture on the new project to be straightforward and clear, with a few students requesting more guidance on specific aspects of the project.""
2. Remove the phrase ""with most students reporting that they did not have any confusion"" as it is implied by the overall tone of the summary and is not necessary to state explicitly.
3. Consider rephrasing the last sentence to make it more concise and focused on the topic. For example: ""Overall, the students seemed well-prepared to tackle the new project and were looking forward to getting started.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The students generally found today's lecture on the new project to be straightforward and clear, with a few students requesting more guidance on specific aspects of the project, such as the procedure for the solar energy project, how to calculate energy units, and the criteria and constraints for assignment 13.

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have beencovered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculationsfor energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculationsin.
I don’t know why researchers use so many units","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on Energy Calculations and Units:

SUMMARY: Students generally found today's lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be straightforward and easy to follow. Many students reported that they did not find anything confusing during the class, and those who did had minor issues with understanding specific concepts such as energy units, conversion tools, and assignment 13. Some students requested more clarification on certain topics, such as the process of making graphs, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the procedure for the solar energy project.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the specific areas where students struggled with energy units and conversion tools, and provide additional support or resources to help them better understand these concepts.
2. Emphasize the importance of clear instructions and rubrics for assignments, as some students found assignment 13 to be confusing due to lack of guidance.
3. Provide more concrete examples or visual aids to help students understand the process of making graphs and the environmental impact of carbon energy, as some students requested more clarification on these topics.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found today's lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be straightforward and easy to follow, with many reporting no confusion. However, some students struggled with specific concepts, such as energy units, conversion tools, and assignment 13. Notably, students requested more clarification on topics like graph-making processes, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the solar energy project procedure. Additionally, some students found assignment 13's instructions unclear, and a few struggled with understanding the differences between criteria and constraints. To improve understanding, consider providing additional support or resources for energy units and conversion tools, emphasizing clear instructions and rubrics for assignments, and offering concrete examples or visual aids for graph-making and environmental impact discussions."
123,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on Assignment 13 clear and straightforward, with most stating that they did not find anything confusing. However, some students mentioned that they would have liked more clarification on certain aspects, such as the capital investment equation and the environmental impact section. Additionally, a few students found the payback period calculations to be a bit confusing, particularly with the different conversions required for coal emissions. Overall, students appreciated the instructor's explanations and found the material easy to understand.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing 
The applications of payback periods and capital investment could have been covered more.
There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

The way to do the calculations of the carbon emissions was confusing and I did not know where to find the numbers.
There was nothing confusing in today's class. It all made sense and was presented well.
The value of the grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline needed more accuracy from the slide in class to the slide for the in class activity.
nothing
The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing 
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today's class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
 I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
 I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
 I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well. 
 The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
 I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
 For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number. 
 I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
 Nothing was confusing today.
 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.

The majority of students found the CO2 emission calculations to be the most confusing aspect of today's class. Many students were unclear about the value of grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline, with discrepancies between the slide in class and the slide in Brightspace. Additionally, the in-class activity was confusing due to the different numbers presented on the slides, which caused uncertainty for some students. However, most students were able to overcome these challenges and understood the concepts presented.

Suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Focus more on the specific issues with the CO2 emission calculations, such as the discrepancy between the slide in class and Brightspace, and the confusion caused by the different numbers presented on the slides. This will help to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.
2. Consider combining the two main points mentioned in the summary into one sentence, such as: ""The CO2 emission calculations were the most confusing aspect of today's class, with students struggling to understand the value of grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline due to discrepancies between the slide in class and Brightspace, and confusion caused by different numbers presented on the slides.""
3. Remove the phrase ""most students were able to overcome these challenges and understood the concepts presented"" as it is not directly related to the topic of CO2 emission calculations and makes the summary less focused.","REFINED SUMMARY: The CO2 emission calculations were the most confusing aspect of today's class, with students struggling to understand the value of grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline due to discrepancies between the slide in class and Brightspace, and confusion caused by different numbers presented on the slides."

SUMMARY: The majority of students found today's lecture on calculating carbon emissions and in-class participation straightforward and easy to follow. However, some students were confused by the discrepancy between the numbers presented on the Brightspace slide and the in-class presentation, which affected their understanding of the in-class activity. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the calculation of CO2 emissions and the format required for the in-class participation. Overall, students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the instructor's explanations, but would benefit from more accuracy and consistency in the presentation of numbers.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points (discrepancy between Brightspace and in-class presentation, and confusion about calculation and format) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise. For example: ""Some students were confused by the discrepancy between the numbers presented on the Brightspace slide and the in-class presentation, which affected their understanding of the in-class activity, and also struggled with the calculation of CO2 emissions and the format required for the in-class participation.""
2. Emphasize the positive aspect of the lecture by highlighting the clarity of the instructor's explanations and the ease of understanding for most students. For example: ""Most students found today's lecture on calculating carbon emissions and in-class participation straightforward and easy to follow, thanks to the instructor's clear explanations.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""Overall, students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the instructor's explanations, but would benefit from more accuracy and consistency in the presentation of numbers."" as it is a bit redundant and can be implied by the previous points.","REFINED SUMMARY: Most students found today's lecture on calculating carbon emissions and in-class participation straightforward and easy to follow, thanks to the instructor's clear explanations.

131,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with many stating that the instructions were straightforward and the presentation was well-organized. Some students did express confusion regarding the details of the BikeShare project, the use of Brightspace, and the organization of assignments and quizzes. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the group dynamics, specifically whether the groups would remain the same throughout the semester or change from assignment to assignment. Overall, students appreciated the interactive nature of the class and the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any doubts.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it","Here is a summary of the focused topic Deliverables/Instructions Unclear:

SUMMARY: Many students were unclear about the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, citing conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document. Students struggled with understanding the iteration section, the feedback process, and the number of ideas required. Additionally, there was confusion about the need for a pros and cons list and the submission deadlines.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider condensing the language to focus more on the specific points of confusion, such as ""Students were unclear about the iteration section"" and ""Conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document caused confusion"". This would make the summary more concise and focused on the main issues.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to avoid using phrases like ""Many students expressed confusion"" and instead use more specific language, such as ""Some students struggled with understanding the iteration section"" or ""A few students were unclear about the feedback process"". This would make the summary more descriptive and less general.
3. To further improve the summary, consider highlighting the most common points of confusion or the most significant issues that students faced. For example, the summary could focus on the confusion surrounding the iteration section, the feedback process, or the submission deadlines, as these seem to be the most common areas of confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were unclear about the deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17, citing conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of the project presentation that students found interesting, such as the video component, working in breakout rooms, or the 3D models, rather than simply stating that the project presentation was the most interesting part of the class. This would make the summary more specific and detailed.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and to the point. For example, instead of saying ""many students found the project presentation aspect of today's class to be the most interesting part"", you could simply say ""students were excited about creating a video to communicate their solutions"".
3. Consider adding more depth to the summary by highlighting any common themes or patterns that emerged from the students' reflections. For example, you could note that students appreciated the opportunity to work collaboratively with their teams, or that they were looking forward to presenting their projects to others.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were excited about creating a video to communicate their solutions for the unit project, and appreciated the opportunity to work in breakout rooms with their teams to prepare for the presentation.

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linearregression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how thatregression works.
What is required for assignment A10
I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient offriction of each material but I was lost because it doesn’t say whetherto make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on thechart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient offriction of each material.
I’m confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.
I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 wasconfusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize theequation in a volume vs height form.
How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what valueswe should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challengingand I don’t know for sure how to get to that point.

 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do!

SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class assignment and project instructions to be somewhat confusing, particularly with regards to the scope and requirements of the project. Some students were unclear about what specific parts of the assignment were due, and others struggled to understand the expectations for the project's problem statement and stakeholder research. Additionally, some students were confused about how to find the project document and what information was required for the assignment. However, many students appreciated the clarity of the instructor's explanations and were able to clarify any confusion with the TA or their peers.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of the assignment that caused confusion, such as the problem statement, stakeholder research, and project scope, rather than generalizing that the assignment was ""somewhat confusing"". This would provide a more detailed and actionable summary.
2. Emphasize the common thread of confusion among students, such as the difficulty in understanding the scope and requirements of the project, and the need for clarification on specific parts of the assignment. This would help to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
3. Consider adding more specific quotes or phrases from the student reflections to support the summary, such as ""confusing about what specific parts of the assignment were due"" or ""struggled to understand the expectations for the project's problem statement"". This would add more depth and nuance to the summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Many students experienced confusion with the in-class assignment and project instructions, particularly with the problem statement, stakeholder research, and project scope.

 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm

 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
 The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
 Applying what we were learning to the skittles example. 
 Something important in today's class was the z scores we learned about.
 Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me",218,"I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms
Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.
I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class.

Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Histograms:

Histograms were found to be an engaging and interesting topic, particularly when combined with the concept of z-scores. Students appreciated the hands-on approach of working in groups to create their own histograms and exploring the relationship between histograms and probability. The use of a real-world example, such as the Skittles activity, was also a highlight for many students. Additionally, students enjoyed learning about the z-score tables and how they can be used to find probabilities without needing a calculator.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of histograms that students found most interesting, such as the hands-on approach or the use of real-world examples, in order to make the summary more concise and targeted.
2. Emphasize the connection between histograms and probability, as this seemed to be a key takeaway for many students.
3. Consider highlighting the practical applications of histograms, such as data visualization and analysis, to give students a better sense of how the concept can be used in real-world contexts.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the topic of histograms engaging and interesting, particularly when combined with z-scores.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.

I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed.
The most interesting thing in today’s class was how everyone interpretedwhat engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had differentvisions, and i found that interesting.
The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the Draw and Engineer Activity:

The Draw and Engineer Activity was a highlight of the first lecture, with students expressing enthusiasm for the interactive and engaging nature of the class. Many students appreciated the opportunity to meet their peers and the professor, and the breakout rooms were a particular hit, allowing for in-depth discussions and a sense of camaraderie. The activity itself, where students drew their vision of an engineer in 2030, was thought-provoking and sparked interesting discussions about the future of engineering. Students enjoyed sharing their drawings and receiving feedback from their peers, and many found the activity to be a refreshing change from traditional lectures.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the Draw and Engineer Activity, rather than including general comments about the class. For example, the first sentence could be rephrased to ""The Draw and Engineer Activity was a highlight of the lecture, allowing students to express their creativity and engage with their peers.""
2. Emphasize the unique aspects of the activity, such as the use of breakout rooms and the opportunity for students to share their drawings and receive feedback. This could help to make the summary more concise and focused.
3. Consider removing some of the repetitive language and phrases, such as ""many students"" and ""students enjoyed."" Instead, try to use more varied language to convey the same ideas.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Draw and Engineer Activity was a highlight of the lecture, allowing students to express their creativity and engage with their peers.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!

I was confused about assignment 18 and the prototypes.","Here is the summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on prototyping and creating prototypes to be clear and easy to follow. However, some students expressed confusion regarding the application of prototyping to abstract ideas, the process of creating prototypes without being in the same physical space, and the use of CAD software. Additionally, some students were unclear about how to collect data for prototypes and how to test online prototypes.

And here are the suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific points of confusion, rather than general statements about the lecture being clear or easy to follow. For example, instead of saying ""some students expressed confusion regarding the application of prototyping to abstract ideas"", it could be rephrased as ""students struggled to apply prototyping to abstract ideas, with some expressing uncertainty about how to create prototypes for intangible concepts"".
2. Consider combining similar points of confusion into a single sentence. For example, the points about creating prototypes without being in the same physical space and using CAD software could be combined into a single sentence, such as ""students were unclear about how to create prototypes without being in the same physical space, and struggled to use CAD software to bring their ideas to life"".
3. Consider removing the sentence about the consistency between the PowerPoint slides and the document provided, as it seems unrelated to the topic of prototyping and creating prototypes.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to apply prototyping to abstract ideas, with some expressing uncertainty about how to create prototypes for intangible concepts.

 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.

there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out.

Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.

 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.

 How dropped grades factor into the midterm grade that is displayed 
 I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable.",275,"The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slideabout the calculations for the participation’s other than to try totrip us up.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us butit seemed meaningless.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity.
It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","Here is the original summary:

The majority of students found the lecture on Gasoline Density clear and easy to understand, with some minor areas of confusion. Some students were unclear about the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity, while others found the carbon footprint calculation confusing due to the inclusion of gasoline density. A few students also expressed difficulty in understanding the difference between assumptions and unreliable data. Overall, the lecture on Gasoline Density was well-received, and students appreciated the emphasis on environmental impacts and the importance of considering these factors in engineering decisions.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific topic of Gasoline Density: While the summary mentions that some students were unclear about the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity, it would be more effective to elaborate on this point and provide specific quotes or examples to illustrate the confusion. This would help to better capture the essence of the topic and provide a more detailed understanding of the students' perspectives.
2. Clarify the main points: The summary jumps between different topics, such as the carbon footprint calculation and the difference between assumptions and unreliable data. To improve the clarity of the summary, it would be helpful to break down the main points into separate paragraphs or sections, and provide a clear and concise summary of each point.
3. Use more precise language: The summary uses general terms such as ""minor areas of confusion"" and ""well-received"". To make the summary more precise, it would be helpful to use more specific language, such as ""some students struggled to understand the relevance of gasoline density"" and ""most students appreciated the emphasis on environmental impacts"". This would help to provide a more accurate and detailed understanding of the students' perspectives.","REFINED SUMMARY:

The majority of students found the lecture on Gasoline Density clear and easy to understand, with some students expressing confusion about the relevance of gasoline density in the in-class activity. Specifically, several students were unclear about why gasoline density was included in the calculation, with some perceiving it as a way to trip them up. Additionally, a few students found the carbon footprint calculation confusing due to the inclusion of gasoline density. However, most students appreciated the emphasis on environmental impacts and the importance of considering these factors in engineering decisions."

 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
 I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred. 
 What was interesting about today's class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster. 
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.

Students were particularly intrigued by the reservoir's negligence and lack of proper ethics, and appreciated the opportunity to analyze the data and understand the causes of the failure. As one student noted, ""I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects."" Another student highlighted the importance of good communication, stating, ""It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives."" Overall, the class provided a valuable opportunity for students to learn from real-world engineering failures and appreciate the significance of attention to detail and ethics in engineering projects."
179,"SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with a few areas of confusion regarding Assignment 10 and the in-class activity. The main points of confusion revolved around the mathematical modeling for the Taum Sauk Reservoir project, specifically the Laminar Approach, and the unclear expectations for the assignment. Additionally, some students were confused about how to find reliable sources, particularly in the context of the in-class activity, and how to cite them. There were also some issues with the clarity of the assignment instructions and the timing of the in-class activity.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.

 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing

 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Tom Sauk Reservoir:

The Tom Sauk Reservoir was a topic of focus in today's lecture, and students generally found the material clear and easy to follow. However, some students struggled with understanding the mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach, which were introduced in the lecture. Additionally, students were unclear about the requirements for scholarly sources and how to find reliable information.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more clarification on the assignment instructions, particularly regarding the mathematical modeling and the Laminar Approach. This could include providing examples or additional resources to help students understand these concepts.
2. Offer more guidance on finding reliable sources, including tips on how to evaluate the credibility of sources and how to use scholarly databases. This could also include providing examples of reliable sources and how to properly cite them.
3. Consider providing more time for the in-class activity to allow students to complete the assignment without feeling rushed. This could also include providing more guidance on the assignment and the expectations for the in-class activity.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Tom Sauk Reservoir lecture was generally clear, but students struggled with understanding the mathematical modeling and Laminar Approach. Additionally, students were unclear about the requirements for scholarly sources and finding reliable information. To improve, providing more clarification on assignment instructions, offering guidance on finding reliable sources, and considering more time for the in-class activity would be beneficial."

Students also mentioned that the expectations for Assignment 10 were unclear, and some felt that more guidance on the assignment's requirements would be beneficial.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Carbon Footprints:

SUMMARY: Students found the topic of carbon footprints to be fascinating and relevant, with many expressing interest in learning about the environmental impact of their daily activities and the role of engineers in addressing climate change. They appreciated the hands-on activities, such as calculating their own carbon footprint and exploring the effects of climate change through visual aids like NASA's climate change website. The concept of trade-offs was also a key takeaway, with students recognizing the importance of considering multiple factors when designing solutions. Overall, the topic sparked a sense of awareness and responsibility among students, encouraging them to think critically about their own impact on the environment and the role they can play in mitigating its effects.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of carbon footprints, rather than including general statements about the topic being ""fascinating and relevant"". This could be achieved by removing the first sentence and starting the summary with ""Students appreciated the hands-on activities..."".
2. Emphasize the students' understanding of the concept of carbon footprints and their personal connection to the topic. For example, the summary could state that ""Students gained a deeper understanding of their own carbon footprint and its impact on the environment"".
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""The concept of trade-offs was also a key takeaway, with students recognizing the importance of considering multiple factors when designing solutions"" to make it more concise and focused on the topic of carbon footprints. For example, ""Students learned to consider the trade-offs between different factors when designing solutions to reduce their carbon footprint"".","REFINED SUMMARY:

SUMMARY: Students expressed varying levels of clarity regarding the assignments, particularly Assignment 5 and Assignment 8. Some students found the instructions unclear, while others appreciated the detail provided. Many students requested more explanation on how to handle missing data, fill in missing values, and understand the concept of z-scores. Additionally, students were confused about the purpose of certain assignments, such as Assignment 8, and would have appreciated more detail on what was expected. Some students also found it challenging to navigate the Brightspace platform and requested better organization and clarity on due dates. Overall, students would benefit from more explicit instructions, examples, and practice exercises to help them better understand the assignments.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the details regarding assignments:

Students expressed varying levels of clarity regarding the assignments, particularly Assignment 5 and Assignment 8. Some students found the instructions unclear, while others appreciated the detail provided. Many students requested more explanation on how to handle missing data, fill in missing values, and understand the concept of z-scores. Additionally, students were confused about the purpose of certain assignments, such as Assignment 8, and would have appreciated more detail on what was expected. Some students also found it challenging to navigate the Brightspace platform and requested better organization and clarity on due dates. Overall, students would benefit from more explicit instructions, examples, and practice exercises to help them better understand the assignments.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining similar ideas into a single sentence or paragraph to make the summary more concise. For example, the requests for more explanation on handling missing data, filling in missing values, and understanding z-scores could be combined into a single sentence.
2. Emphasize the most common themes or concerns expressed by the students, rather than listing every single point. This will help to distill the main issues and make the summary more focused.
3. Consider rephrasing some of the sentences to make them more concise and clear. For example, the sentence ""Students expressed varying levels of clarity regarding the assignments, particularly Assignment 5 and Assignment 8"" could be rephrased to ""Students had mixed reactions to the clarity of the assignments, with some finding them unclear and others appreciating the detail provided.""","REFINED SUMMARY:

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.

 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better

We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions and examples on how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, as this was a common point of confusion for many students.
2. Offer additional practice exercises or examples to help students solidify their understanding of the z-score calculation and its relationship to probability.
3. Clarify the purpose and expectations for the in-class activity and assignment, and provide more guidance on how to approach the task.","REFINED SUMMARY: The Skittles Example was a topic of confusion for many students, with several students struggling to understand the concept of switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages.

 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on clients, users, and stakeholders to be clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion or difficulties. However, some students struggled with understanding the distinction between clients and users, with a few expressing uncertainty about how to identify and empathize with different users. Additionally, some students found the assignment requirements for A16 to be unclear, particularly regarding the submission of sections II, III, and IV.

Suggestions:

1. To further clarify the distinction between clients and users, consider providing concrete examples or case studies that illustrate the differences between the two. This could help students better understand the roles and responsibilities of each.
2. To address the uncertainty about how to identify and empathize with different users, consider providing more guidance on user research methods, such as surveys, interviews, and observations. This could help students develop a deeper understanding of user needs and behaviors.
3. To improve the clarity of assignment requirements, consider providing more detailed instructions and examples for each section of the assignment. This could help reduce confusion and ensure that students are on the right track.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on clients, users, and stakeholders to be clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion or difficulties.

The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity

That the corolla produced 260 grams of CO2 per mile, that is actually quite bit. 
I found the discussion on design trade offs very interesting
I found the way to find my car's carbon emission very interesting.
I found the entire lecture on the environment and our carbon footprint interesting. 
What I found most interesting in class was the amount of everyday life that contributes to your personal carbon footprint. I took the survey from the link shown in class to determine my own. 
The group time was very helpful and the carbon emissions talk was very interesting to learn about my personal effect
What I found most interesting about today's class was how engineers have to take into account everything that is going on into the world around them and apply that to the job they are doing. 
I found the website to calculate your personal carbon footprint interesting. 
It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety. 
 The in class activity was an interesting way to practice unit conversions
 I liked the theory at the beginning of the class when we talked about trade offs
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was the inclusion of carbon emissions and their importance to our project and their impact on the world we live in. Connecting it to engineering as a whole helped stress the importance of being aware of how your projects may impact the world and others.
 Something interesting in today's class was the carbon footprint website, because it was cool to see the impact I have on the world. 
 I found it interesting how you can estimate your own carbon footprint. 
 Project 3 is really interesting and is reminding me how much I enjoy industrial engineering and mathematical calculations and analyses. 
 The criteria and constraints were very useful to think about what my group needs to consider still.
 I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
 What I found most interesting was the carbon footprint. I knew about calculating my own carbon footprint but it never occurred to me to calculate something like my cars carbon footprint. 
 global warming website to show the changes over time
 It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
 The interaction was interesting 
 I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts 
 Learning about trade offs was pretty interesting in today's lecture. I also like that we are focusing on carbon footprints. Anytime we learn about the environment in any way, I am happy with that respective session
 The most interesting part about today's class was to do the in class activity with the car CO2 emited, is interesting to learn more about our impact to the environment 
 I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
 I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
 I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
 CO2 footprint
 I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
 I liked that we had a lot of studio time to work on our assignments and finish then so that we don't have to spend time outside of class.
 I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
 I found it very inters to calculated the carbon emission of my car. I would have never thought it was that much. 
 I like the idea of talking about renewable energy's I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight 
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I'm glad it was covered in today's class period. 
 It was interesting to see our midterm grades, as well as learn about carbon footprints.

SUMMARY: Today's lecture on climate change and carbon footprints sparked interesting discussions and reflections among students. Many students found the topic of carbon emissions and their impact on the environment fascinating, particularly the calculation of their own car's carbon footprint. The concept of design trade-offs was also a highlight, as students appreciated the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions. The inclusion of real-world examples and interactive activities, such as the in-class activity on calculating carbon emissions, helped to engage students and make the topic more relatable. Overall, the lecture effectively conveyed the significance of climate change and its effects on human safety, emphasizing the role of engineers in addressing this critical issue.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of climate change, rather than including general statements about the lecture. For example, the summary could start with ""The lecture highlighted the importance of climate change and its impact on the environment, with many students finding the calculation of their own car's carbon footprint to be a fascinating and eye-opening experience.""
2. Emphasize the students' reactions to the topic of climate change, rather than just stating that they found it interesting. For example, the summary could include phrases such as ""students were shocked by the amount of CO2 emissions their cars produce"" or ""students were inspired to take action to reduce their own carbon footprint.""
3. Consider adding more specific details about the interactive activities and real-world examples used in the lecture, as these seemed to be particularly effective in engaging students. For example, the summary could mention the ""in-class activity on calculating carbon emissions"" or the ""NASA site that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts.""","Here is the refined summary:

REFINED SUMMARY: The lecture on climate change and carbon footprints sparked a range of reactions among students, with many finding the calculation of their own car's carbon footprint to be a fascinating and eye-opening experience.

We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.

 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points about students struggling with testing and creating prototypes using CAD software into a single sentence. For example: ""Students were unclear about the prototyping process, particularly with regards to testing and creating prototypes using CAD software, which led to difficulties in understanding how to test their designs, especially when working remotely or without access to physical materials.""
2. Emphasize the specific aspect of CAD software that students found challenging, such as ""creating and testing CAD models"" or ""using CAD software to develop prototypes"". This would help to further focus the summary on the specific topic of CAD.
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Some students felt that the instructions for Assignment 18 were unclear"" to make it more concise and specific.

One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints

The in-class activity on calculating carbon emissions and environmental impact was a key topic of discussion in today's lecture. While some students found the activity to be straightforward and easy to follow, others reported being confused about the relevance of density in the calculations and the conversion of environmental data to carbon footprint. Additionally, some students struggled to understand how to apply the concepts to their current project, Assignment 13. There was also some confusion about how to determine which assumptions to make and how to communicate them effectively.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the importance of density in the calculations and providing more context on why it's included in the activity. This could help alleviate confusion and provide a clearer understanding of the relevance of density.
2. Provide more guidance on how to apply the concepts to Assignment 13, such as providing examples or case studies that illustrate how to calculate carbon emissions and environmental impact in a real-world scenario.

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas or phrases into a single sentence. For example, the original summary mentions both ""brainstorming and idea generation"" and ""developing solutions and prototypes"" - these could be combined into a single sentence that focuses on the idea generation process.
2. Consider removing phrases that don't directly relate to the topic of brainstorming/ideas. For example, the original summary mentions ""the availability of various clients and methods for testing and evaluating prototypes"" - while this is an important aspect of the class, it's not directly related to brainstorming/ideas. Instead, focus on the ideas and concepts that students found most interesting.
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing phrases that are more general or vague. For example, the original summary mentions ""the design project"" - while this is a broad topic, it's not directly related to brainstorming/ideas. Instead, focus on the specific ideas and concepts that students found most interesting.

Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently.

SUMMARY: Most students found the lecture on Assignment 17 to be clear and straightforward, with only a few minor points of confusion. Some students had difficulty understanding the requirements of the assignment, particularly with regards to the extent of the in-class activity and the number of pros and cons to be considered. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the functional decomposition chart and the type of solution necessary for the assignment. However, overall, students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the helpfulness of the TAs during the in-class activity.

* Consider focusing more specifically on the topic of Milestone 2, as some of the points mentioned in the summary (e.g. confusion about Milestone 1a and 1) are not directly related to Milestone 2. This could help to make the summary more concise and targeted.
* Emphasize the specific areas of confusion that students had with finding Vmax, such as the process of deriving it from graphs, and consider providing more detail on how to address these areas of confusion.
* Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the students' abilities and strengths, rather than their areas of confusion. For example, instead of saying ""students struggled with finding the maximum velocity (Vmax)"", you could say ""students were able to derive ideas for finding slopes and velocities, but needed more guidance on specific calculations and coding"".

When to use strong induction over weak induction","Here is a revised summary that focuses on the topic of strong induction in general:

SUMMARY: Students found strong induction challenging, struggling to determine the number of base cases to use and how to apply the principle, particularly with abstract cases. Many students felt uncertain about when to use strong induction versus weak induction, questioning the distinction between the two.

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the students' struggles with determining the number of base cases to use with their confusion about applying the principle, to create a more concise summary that highlights the core challenges students faced. For example: ""Students struggled to determine the number of base cases to use and apply the strong induction principle, particularly with abstract cases.""
2. Emphasize the students' uncertainty about when to use strong induction versus weak induction, and consider adding a sentence or two to clarify the distinction between the two. For example: ""Students were unclear about when to use strong induction versus weak induction, with many questioning the necessity of the distinction between the two.""
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the students' experiences and emotions, rather than just stating the challenges they faced.

 having the visual representation of the phasors made it easier to do some of the questions
 I thought it was interesting to see how z = R at resonance.
 I enjoyed the changing oscillating ammeter. 
 visual of waves
 I loved the part in class where we were discussing the conceptual based questions
 The demonstration of the graphs
 Difference between wd and w
 Knowing the differences between the three with graphs and equations
 At resonance,  X_L=X_C
 Phasers are fun
 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution
