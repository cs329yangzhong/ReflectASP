why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear. 
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz. 
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me. 
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?
I'm a bit confused by how the equations relate together so more explanation and examples would be great. 
The concept of dielectrics weakening the electric field inside of a capacitor. Some Diagrams in the Capacitance Defined part 4 video showed the net electric field was decreasing inside of a material acting as a dielectric however the electric field was not shown to be flowing through the material in other diagrams so I'm curious about how exactly that electric field is being decreased.
 Are capitators used specifically in circuits are can they be observed in nature.

 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles.

Additionally, students struggled with understanding how charge is distributed on capacitors in series and parallel, and the difference between using the formula C1*C2/C1+C2 and the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more specifically on the topic of capacitors, as some of the points mentioned (such as current density and electric field) are not directly related to capacitors. For example, the summary could be rewritten to only include points about capacitors, such as the confusion around simplifying circuit diagrams, charge distribution in series and parallel, and the formula for equivalent capacitance.
* Clarify the language used in the summary to make it more concise and easy to understand. For example, instead of saying ""some topics remained unclear"", the summary could say ""students struggled with specific concepts, including...""
* Consider breaking the summary into smaller, more manageable points to make it easier to read and understand. For example, the summary could be rewritten to have separate paragraphs or bullet points for each of the specific topics that students found confusing.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on capacitors clear, but struggled with specific concepts.

I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

 The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole 
 The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating. 
 I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
 projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant 
 The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent. 
 The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
 I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other. 
 projectile motion and falling monkey
 I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about. 
 The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
 The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
 The FBD drawings 
 I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.

SUMMARY: Students found the TopHat questions engaging and helpful in understanding the material, particularly the monkey problem, which was considered interesting and unique. Many appreciated the visual aids, such as the video demonstrations, and the group work in breakout rooms. The concept of projectile motion, including the independence of horizontal and vertical components, was also a major topic of interest.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of TopHat questions that students found engaging, such as the interactive nature or the ability to visualize complex concepts. This could help to make the summary more concise and targeted to the topic.
2. Remove the mention of ""many appreciated"" and instead use more specific quotes or examples from the reflections to support the points being made. This could help to make the summary more concrete and based on the actual experiences of the students.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the benefits of TopHat questions, such as their ability to increase engagement or promote deeper understanding, rather than simply stating that they were ""engaging and helpful"". This could help to make the summary more impactful and focused on the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found TopHat questions engaging and interactive, particularly the monkey problem, which helped them visualize complex concepts. The questions' ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts and provide real-world applications was highlighted as a key benefit. The use of video demonstrations and group work in breakout rooms also received praise, as it allowed students to work collaboratively and apply their understanding of projectile motion."
51,"Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Vector Addition:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of vector addition, particularly the idea of moving backwards along one arrow and subtracting it, to be a novel and engaging way to understand the process. They appreciated the use of real-world examples, such as the hockey game and the yeti problem, to illustrate the application of vector addition. Many students enjoyed the hands-on practice in breakout rooms, which allowed them to collaborate with peers and work through problems in a more interactive way. The use of visual aids, such as diagrams and pictures, was also highlighted as a helpful tool for understanding the concept. Overall, students found vector addition to be an interesting and accessible topic that was made more engaging through the use of interactive activities and real-world examples.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.

 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups

 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors.

 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.

 The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked.

 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
 I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it.  I will have to go back and review my FBD!
 I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.

SUMMARY: Students were generally confused about the 3 Blocks Example, specifically with setting up the free body diagrams and understanding the concept of tension forces. Many students struggled with the idea of two tension forces acting on the blocks, particularly when the blocks are connected by a pulley. Some students also found it challenging to visualize the forces between multiple objects and how they affect the system.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific aspects of the 3 Blocks Example that caused confusion, such as ""Students struggled to understand the concept of two tension forces acting on the blocks when connected by a pulley"" or ""Many students found it challenging to set up free body diagrams for the 3 Blocks Example, particularly when dealing with multiple tension forces"".
2. Consider breaking the summary into two separate sentences to make it more concise and focused. For example: ""Students struggled to understand the concept of two tension forces acting on the blocks when connected by a pulley. Additionally, many students found it challenging to set up free body diagrams for the 3 Blocks Example.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""specifically with setting up the free body diagrams and understanding the concept of tension forces"" as it is somewhat redundant and doesn't add much value to the summary. The summary can still convey the main points of confusion without it.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of two tension forces acting on the blocks when connected by a pulley, and many found it challenging to set up free body diagrams for the 3 Blocks Example, particularly when dealing with multiple tension forces."

Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.

 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
 Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
 It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction.

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
 Break out room discussions
 I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style.

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

The examples of uniform circular motion, including the skier and pendulum, were also highlighted as fascinating.",Centripetal force problems,"I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting
What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting
 I enjoyed learning about terminal velocity and how to solve for it.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",74,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).

SUMMARY: Students generally found the Right-Hand Rule explanation straightforward, with some minor confusions regarding its application in 2D graphs and determining the direction of the result when using cross products. Students struggled to visualize the rule, particularly when dealing with 3D objects and the z-axis.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of visualizing the Right-Hand Rule in 2D graphs, highlighting common mistakes and misconceptions that students may have. This could be done by providing additional examples or exercises that focus on this specific aspect.
2. Clarify the concept of the z-axis in 3D objects and how it relates to the Right-Hand Rule. This could be done by providing more visual aids or examples that demonstrate the relationship between the z-axis and the direction of the cross product.
3. Provide more guidance on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration, as this was a topic that students found confusing. This could be done by providing additional examples or exercises that demonstrate this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the Right-Hand Rule explanation straightforward, but struggled to visualize its application in 2D graphs, particularly with the z-axis.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that

It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d

SUMMARY: Students found relative motion challenging, particularly with vector addition/subtraction. Many struggled with the monkey and bullet example, and some had difficulty with initial velocity equations and conceptualizing relative speed. Students also had trouble with vector components and reference frames in 1D and 2D relative motion.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more concrete examples and visual aids to help students understand when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. The monkey and bullet example, in particular, seemed to be a sticking point for many students.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding the reference frames and how they affect the addition and subtraction of vectors. Providing more practice problems and examples that involve different reference frames could help students solidify their understanding.
3. Consider breaking down the concept of relative motion into smaller, more manageable parts, such as focusing on 1D motion before moving to 2D. This could help students build a stronger foundation and reduce confusion.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found relative motion challenging, particularly with vector addition/subtraction, citing the monkey and bullet example as a sticking point.

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of Vectors and Directions, as per the focused topic. For example, the summary could start with ""Students struggled with vector addition and subtraction in relative motion, particularly when dealing with multiple velocities and reference frames.""
2. Remove the phrase ""with many struggling to understand"" and instead use more concise language to convey the idea that students found relative motion challenging. For example, ""Students found relative motion challenging, particularly with vector addition and subtraction.""

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer.

Summary: Students generally found the lecture on Vector Math clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. Many students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in specific problem scenarios. Some students also found the concept of unit vectors and their application to be unclear. Additionally, a few students had difficulty navigating the Top Hat platform and understanding how to submit answers. Overall, students appreciated the visual aids and worked examples provided in the lecture, and most felt that the material was well-explained.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the context of a problem when deciding whether to add or subtract vectors. This could be done by providing more examples that illustrate the difference between adding and subtracting vectors in different scenarios.
2. Provide more explicit explanations and examples of how to apply unit vectors in different problems. This could include more visual aids and worked examples to help students understand the concept better.
3. Offer additional support for students who are struggling with the Top Hat platform, such as a quick tutorial or a list of common issues and solutions.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the Vector Math lecture clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion.

Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos.

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of angles that students found confusing, such as the conversion between quadrants, direction of negative vectors, and adding 180 degrees to an angle. The current summary mentions these points, but could be more concise and specific.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the topic of angles. For example, instead of saying ""Many students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract angles..."", consider saying ""Students struggled with converting between quadrants and determining when to add or subtract angles.""
3. Emphasize the common theme of visual aids and examples being helpful in understanding angles. This could be a key takeaway from the lecture, and highlighting it in the summary could help reinforce the importance of visual learning in understanding complex concepts like angles.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on angles clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion.

Some students struggled with the format of the question and the time constraints, while others found it helpful to have the opportunity to practice applying the concepts learned in class.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more guidance on the format and expectations for the TopHat question, such as the time allowed for each question and the types of questions that will be asked.
2. Offer additional practice opportunities for students to apply the concepts learned in class, such as through online quizzes or homework assignments.
3. Consider providing more feedback on the TopHat questions, such as indicating which answers are correct or incorrect, to help students understand the concepts better.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat question to be challenging, particularly in determining when to add or subtract vectors. Many students struggled with the format and time constraints, while others found it helpful to practice applying concepts learned in class. Some students also mentioned that they would benefit from more guidance on the format and expectations for the TopHat question, as well as additional practice opportunities to reinforce their understanding of vector addition and subtraction."

93,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks and forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and friction. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially those involving frictionless surfaces and blocks stacked on top of each other. Some students also had difficulty understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as the concept of fsmax. Additionally, students requested more practice problems and examples to help solidify their understanding of these concepts.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks and forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and friction. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially those involving frictionless surfaces and blocks stacked on top of each other. Some students also had difficulty understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction, as well as the concept of fsmax. Additionally, students requested more practice problems and examples to help solidify their understanding of these concepts.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most common pain points: Instead of mentioning all the struggles students had, focus on the most common pain points, such as the difficulty with top hat questions involving frictionless surfaces and blocks stacked on top of each other. This will help to identify the most critical areas that need improvement.
2. Use more specific language: The summary could be more specific about the types of friction and forces that students struggled with. For example, instead of saying ""multiple forces and friction"", it could say ""friction on inclined planes"" or ""static and kinetic friction"".
3. Highlight the need for more practice: The summary mentions that students requested more practice problems and examples, but it could be highlighted more prominently. This could be done by adding a sentence or two to emphasize the importance of practice in solidifying students' understanding of these concepts.","Here is a revised summary that incorporates the suggestions:

3. Offer more guidance on how to create accurate FBDs, including tips on how to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts and how to identify the relevant forces acting on each object or block.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and complex systems. They struggled with understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction, determining the correct type of friction to use, and creating accurate diagrams, especially when dealing with multiple blocks or objects interacting with each other. Students also requested more practice with FBDs and examples of how to apply them to real-world problems."

 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams

 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Terminal Velocity:

Terminal velocity was a challenging concept for many students, particularly in the context of changing densities and forces. Students struggled to set up the equation for terminal velocity and to understand how to apply it to different scenarios.

Suggestions:

* Clarify the concept of terminal velocity and its relationship to changing densities and forces.
* Provide more examples and applications of terminal velocity in different scenarios.
* Emphasize the importance of understanding the units of the drag force and how to apply it to real-world problems.

Note: The original summary is already quite concise, but the suggestions are based on the students' reflections and aim to provide more clarity and support for their understanding of the topic.","Here is a refined summary based on the students' reflections:

REFINED SUMMARY: Students found terminal velocity challenging to grasp, particularly when dealing with changing densities and forces. They struggled to set up the equation and apply it to different scenarios, citing difficulties with centripetal force and drag force units. To improve understanding, it's essential to provide more examples, clarify the concept, and emphasize the importance of applying drag force units to real-world problems."

1. Focus on the most common areas of confusion: Instead of mentioning that students found the concept of WDM clear, focus on the areas where students were most confused, such as the distinction between criteria and metrics, and the application and completion of the in-class activity. This will make the summary more concise and relevant to the topic.

Example: SUMMARY: Students struggled with distinguishing between criteria and metrics in the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), and were unclear about the application and completion of the in-class activity.

2. Remove unnecessary words: The original summary includes phrases such as ""generally found"" and ""some students"", which are not necessary to convey the main points. Remove these words to make the summary more concise.

Example: SUMMARY: Students struggled with distinguishing between criteria and metrics in the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), and were unclear about the application and completion of the in-class activity.

3. Use more specific language: Instead of using vague terms like ""struggled"", use more specific language to describe the areas of confusion. For example, instead of saying ""struggled with filling out the decision matrix"", say ""had difficulty understanding how to fill out the decision matrix without a clear understanding of the WDM process"".

Some students requested more clarification on specific aspects of Assignment 13, such as the procedure for solar energy project, variables and graph-making, and constraints and criteria. A few students were unclear about the in-class activity, particularly regarding the conversion tool and energy units. Overall, students appreciated the clear explanations and felt well-prepared for the project.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary by focusing on the most common themes and eliminating repetitive statements. For example, instead of listing multiple students who found the class ""straightforward and clear"", you could simply state that ""most students found the class easy to follow"".
2. Emphasize the specific areas where students needed more clarification, such as the procedure for the solar energy project, variables and graph-making, and constraints and criteria. This would provide a more detailed understanding of the students' needs and concerns.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the topic of Assignment 13.

SUMMARY: Students generally found today's lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be clear and straightforward, with many reporting that they did not find anything confusing. Some students requested more information on specific topics, such as the process of making graphs, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the procedure for the solar energy project. Additionally, some students were unclear about the criteria and constraints for Assignment 13, and a few requested more guidance on how to approach the assignment. Overall, students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the instructor's ability to address their questions in a timely manner.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of Energy Calculations and Units, rather than including general comments about the clarity of the lecture. For example, the summary could focus on the specific topics that students were unclear about, such as the process of making graphs, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the procedure for the solar energy project.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and to the point. For example, instead of saying ""Students generally found today's lecture on Energy Calculations and Units to be clear and straightforward"", the summary could simply state ""Students had a clear understanding of the material covered in today's lecture on Energy Calculations and Units"".
3. Consider adding more specific details about the topics that students were unclear about, rather than simply stating that some students requested more information.

Additionally, a few students mentioned that they would have benefited from more clarity on the conversion process for the in-class participation.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the CO2 emission calculations, rather than mentioning the overall straightforwardness of the class. For example: ""Students experienced confusion due to inconsistencies between numbers presented in PowerPoint slides and in-class activity, specifically with CO2 emission calculations.""
2. Emphasize the specific issue with the numbers on the slides not matching, as this was a common point of confusion for many students. For example: ""Students were confused by the discrepancy between the numbers on the PowerPoint slides and the in-class activity, which affected their ability to accurately calculate CO2 emissions.""
3. Consider adding a sentence to highlight the need for clearer instructions on the conversion process for the in-class participation, as this was a point of confusion for some students. For example: ""To improve future classes, providing clearer instructions on the conversion process for in-class participation would be beneficial for students to accurately calculate CO2 emissions.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students experienced confusion due to inconsistencies between numbers presented in PowerPoint slides and in-class activity, specifically with CO2 emission calculations.

Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.

 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

* Emphasize the specific aspects of the project that students found most valuable, such as the autonomy to design their own solutions, the process of problem scoping, and the application of skills learned throughout the semester. This will help to create a more focused and concise summary.
* Consider using more active verbs to make the summary more dynamic and engaging.

SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process to be the most interesting part of the lecture, as it allowed them to view a problem from various perspectives and consider different methods and processes for making decisions. They appreciated the hands-on approach to working on the project, which gave them a sense of ownership and motivation to work on the assignment. Many students enjoyed the freedom to design their own solutions and the opportunity to apply the skills they have learned throughout the semester.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of problem scoping: While the original summary mentions that students found problem scoping to be the most interesting part of the lecture, it would be helpful to specify what exactly they found interesting about it. For example, was it the process of viewing a problem from various perspectives, or the consideration of different methods and processes for making decisions? This would provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of what students took away from the lecture.

2. Emphasize the relevance of problem scoping to real-world engineering: While the original summary mentions that students enjoyed the freedom to design their own solutions, it would be helpful to emphasize the relevance of problem scoping to real-world engineering. For example, how does problem scoping help engineers identify and address the needs of stakeholders and users? How does it inform the design process and lead to more effective solutions? By highlighting the practical applications of problem scoping, the summary can help students see its value and importance in their future careers.

3. Use more concise language: The original summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise and focused. For example, instead of saying ""they appreciated the hands-on approach to working on the project, which gave them a sense of ownership and motivation to work on the assignment,"" the summary could simply state ""students enjoyed the hands-on approach to problem scoping, which fostered a sense of ownership and motivation."" By using more concise language, the summary can be more easily digested and understood by the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found problem scoping to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture, as it allowed them to consider diverse perspectives and methods for decision-making.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity 
        Original Summary: Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the carbon footprint calculations/activity:

SUMMARY: Students found the carbon footprint calculations and activity to be engaging and thought-provoking, with many expressing surprise at the large impact their individual actions have on the environment. They were interested in learning about their own carbon footprint, including the amount of energy they use and the number of ""earths"" required if everyone lived like them. The activity also sparked discussions about the importance of considering ethics in engineering and the need to reduce carbon emissions. Many students appreciated the hands-on approach to calculating their carbon footprint and enjoyed working in teams to complete the assignment.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the carbon footprint calculations and activity, avoiding general statements about the class or assignment.

147,"SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the Laminar Approach to be clear and straightforward, with some students expressing confusion regarding the application of the approach to specific assignments, such as A10 and A11. Some students were unclear on the concept of the Laminar Approach itself, while others found it difficult to understand how to use it to calculate volume and height. There was also some confusion around the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do!

 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.

I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation.","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the Laminar Approach to be clear and straightforward, with some students expressing confusion regarding the application of the approach to specific assignments, such as A10 and A11. Some students were unclear on the concept of the Laminar Approach itself, while others found it difficult to understand how to use it to calculate volume and height. There was also some confusion around the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific points of confusion: While the summary mentions that some students were unclear on the concept of the Laminar Approach, it would be more helpful to specify what exactly was unclear. For example, was it the definition, the application to specific assignments, or something else? This would provide more targeted feedback for the instructor.
2. Use more concise language: The summary is a bit wordy and could be condensed to make it more concise. For example, instead of saying ""some students expressing confusion regarding the application of the approach to specific assignments, such as A10 and A11"", it could simply say ""students were confused about applying the Laminar Approach to A10 and A11"".
3. Emphasize the most common points of confusion: The summary mentions that some students were unclear on the concept of the Laminar Approach, but it would be more effective to highlight the most common points of confusion. For example, if most students were confused about using SSE, SST, and r^2 values, the summary could focus on that specifically.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the Laminar Approach clear and straightforward, but some students struggled to understand its application to specific assignments, particularly A10 and A11. The most common points of confusion revolved around the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values, with some students unclear on their definitions and purposes. Additionally, a few students found it challenging to grasp the concept of the Laminar Approach itself, particularly its relationship to volume and height calculations."

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all!

 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.

 SST and SSE

 I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear. ",207,"The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that aresimilar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work,but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail inlecture.

Summary: Students were generally unclear about the concepts of SSE, SST, r, and r^2, with some expressing a desire for more detailed explanations and examples. A few students found the laminar approach confusing, particularly in assignment A10.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more detailed explanations and examples of SSE, SST, r, and r^2, as some students found these concepts confusing.
2. Offer additional support and clarification on the laminar approach, particularly in assignment A10, to help students better understand its application.
3. Consider providing more explicit guidance on how to use SSE, SST, r, and r^2 in real-world problems, as some students were unclear about their practical applications.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concepts of SSE, SST, r, and r^2, with many expressing a need for more detailed explanations and examples. The laminar approach was also a source of confusion, particularly in assignment A10. To improve understanding, providing additional support and clarification on these topics, as well as explicit guidance on their practical applications, would be beneficial."

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most common areas of confusion: While the original summary mentions multiple areas of confusion, it could be condensed to focus on the most common ones, such as converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding the flow rate chart. This would make the summary more concise and targeted.
2. Avoid using vague language: The original summary uses phrases like ""some minor areas of confusion"" and ""wished for more detail."" These phrases are vague and don't provide specific information. Instead, the summary could be rewritten to provide more concrete details about the areas of confusion and what students were looking for in terms of clarification.
3. Emphasize the importance of clarity: The original summary could be rewritten to emphasize the importance of clarity in the lecture on Power Calculation. For example, it could state that students appreciated the clear explanations, but noted that some areas required further clarification. This would provide a more balanced view of the lecture and highlight the importance of clear communication in the classroom.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Power Calculation clear, with some areas of confusion around converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding the flow rate chart.

3. Consider breaking the summary into two separate paragraphs, one focusing on the technical aspects of the project (e.g. unclear expectations, conflicting messages) and another focusing on the conceptual aspects (e.g. open-ended nature of the project, lack of clear instructions).

I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.

 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms.

 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.

The students' reflections indicate that they struggled with the mathematical modeling process, particularly with the laminar approach and deriving mathematical equations from tables. Many students found the in-class assignments confusing, citing unclear instructions and difficulty understanding which variables to use. Additionally, students were unsure about how to simplify diagrams and create mathematical models, with some seeking more guidance on using Excel for regression and calculating volume.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions for the in-class assignments, including clear explanations of variables and calculations. This could be achieved by providing a step-by-step guide or example problems to work through.
2. Offer additional guidance on the laminar approach, including examples of how to derive mathematical equations from tables and how to apply this approach to real-world problems.
3. Provide more support for students in simplifying diagrams and creating mathematical models, such as offering additional resources or one-on-one assistance.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the mathematical modeling process, particularly with the laminar approach and deriving mathematical equations from tables.

I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of. 
 I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered. 
 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.
 I thought that today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms. 
 I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could've been a could idea. 
 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations 
 I think we should've talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing.

SUMMARY: Students found the Laminar Approach challenging, with many expressing confusion about how to apply it to the in-class assignment and mathematical models for Assignment 10. They struggled with unclear instructions, particularly regarding variable use and diagram simplification. Students requested more examples and guidance on deriving mathematical equations from tables and creating mathematical models in Excel.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions and examples on how to apply the Laminar Approach to the in-class assignment and Assignment 10, including clear guidance on variable use and diagram simplification.
2. Offer additional support and guidance on deriving mathematical equations from tables and creating mathematical models in Excel, such as providing step-by-step examples or online resources.
3. Consider providing more practice exercises or case studies that demonstrate the application of the Laminar Approach to real-world problems, to help students better understand the concept and build their confidence in applying it.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the Laminar Approach challenging, with many expressing confusion about how to apply it to the in-class assignment and mathematical models for Assignment 10.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.

 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.

 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B

 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don't think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn't find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
 the new project
 The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment.

I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
Due date for Assignment #10
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12

FOCUSED TOPIC: Tom Sauk Reservoir
Original Summary: SUMMARY: The students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failure to be insightful, highlighting the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in engineering projects. Many students were fascinated by the catastrophic consequences of small oversights and the devastating impact on the environment and people. The class also appreciated the opportunity to work in groups and analyze the failure, recognizing the value of teamwork and collaboration in engineering.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, rather than mentioning ""engineering projects"" in general. For example: ""The students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failure to be insightful, highlighting the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in the design and construction of the reservoir.""
2. Emphasize the most common theme that emerged from the students' reflections, which is the importance of attention to detail and ethics in engineering. For example: ""The students were struck by the devastating consequences of small oversights and unethical decisions in the design and construction of the Tom Sauk Reservoir, emphasizing the critical importance of attention to detail and ethical considerations in engineering.""
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight the students' appreciation for the opportunity to work in groups and analyze the failure, as this was a common theme in the reflections. For example: ""The class also appreciated the opportunity to work in groups and analyze the failure, recognizing the value of teamwork and collaboration in engineering, and gaining a deeper understanding of the complex factors that contributed to the reservoir's collapse.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failure to be insightful, highlighting the devastating consequences of small oversights and unethical decisions in the design and construction of the reservoir.

Summary: Students found the concept of scholarly work and citations to be confusing, particularly in regards to determining the reliability of sources and how to properly cite them. Many students were unclear about what constitutes a scholarly source, and how to distinguish it from other types of sources.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit guidance on what constitutes a scholarly source and how to identify it. This could include examples of scholarly sources and non-scholarly sources, and a discussion of the characteristics of scholarly sources (e.g. peer-reviewed, academic journals, etc.).
2. Offer more support and resources for students who are struggling to understand the importance of citing sources and how to do so correctly. This could include additional readings, online tutorials, or one-on-one meetings with the instructor.
3. Consider providing more explicit guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources, including how to assess the credibility of authors, the relevance of the information, and the potential biases of the source.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of scholarly work and citations to be confusing, particularly in determining the reliability of sources and proper citation.

The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.

Students also requested more practice with probability and z-scores, as well as more examples of how to apply these concepts to real-world problems.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.

 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Original Summary: The majority of students found the Skittles Example to be a bit confusing, particularly when it came to switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Some students also struggled with understanding the concept of z-scores and how to apply them to real-world problems. Additionally, there was a desire for more practice and examples to help solidify the understanding of probability and z-scores.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more explicit instructions on how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, as this was a common point of confusion. This could include providing a step-by-step guide or example to help students understand the process.
2. Provide more examples and practice problems that demonstrate the application of z-scores to real-world problems. This could include case studies or scenarios that illustrate how z-scores can be used to analyze and interpret data.
3. Consider providing additional resources or support for students who are struggling to understand the concept of z-scores. This could include online tutorials, videos, or additional practice exercises to help students build their understanding of this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the Skittles Example confusing, particularly when switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Students struggled with understanding z-scores and applying them to real-world problems. To improve understanding, explicit instructions on switching the x-axis to percentages, more examples and practice problems demonstrating z-score applications, and additional resources for struggling students are recommended."

SUMMARY: Students had mixed reactions to the lecture, with some expressing confusion regarding the submission of Assignment 10 and the introduction of Assignment 12. Some students found the lecture straightforward and easy to follow, while others were unclear about the details of the assignments, particularly the calculation of flow rate and the selection of time intervals.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific issues with Assignment 10, such as the confusion regarding submission and the need for more clarity on flow rate calculations, rather than mentioning the introduction of Assignment 12, which is not directly related to the topic.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the main points, such as: ""Students experienced confusion regarding the submission of Assignment 10, particularly with flow rate calculations and time interval selection.""

There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",409,"The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on projects to be straightforward and easy to follow, with many reporting that they understood the material well. However, some students were confused about the scope of the project, particularly with regards to the problem statement and criteria.

Suggestions:

1. Consider breaking down the problem statement and criteria into smaller, more manageable parts to help students better understand the scope of the project.
2. Provide more guidance on the process of empathizing with users, including how to identify and understand their needs and concerns.
3. Clarify the assignment details, including the submission requirements and the amount of work expected in a short amount of time, to avoid confusion and overwhelm.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on projects to be straightforward and easy to follow, with many reporting that they understood the material well.

Summary: Students found the executive summary and problem statement of Assignment 16 clear, but struggled with understanding the scope of the background information and incorporating stakeholders into the project. They also had difficulty with criteria and constraints for the problem statement and empathizing with users.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the scope of the background information and provide more guidance on how to incorporate stakeholders into the project. This could be done by providing more specific examples or case studies to illustrate how to apply the concepts.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on the criteria and constraints for the problem statement, such as providing a clear outline or template to follow. This could help students better understand what is expected and how to approach the assignment.
3. Offer more support and resources for empathizing with users, such as additional readings or online resources. This could help students develop a deeper understanding of the importance of user-centered design and how to apply it in their projects.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible.

 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.

 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.

 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.

 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
 Nothing
 the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear 
 I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details",413,"The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test.
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.
How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of CAD:

SUMMARY: Students struggled with the prototyping process, particularly with testing and developing prototypes using CAD software. Many students were unclear about how to test their prototypes, especially when working remotely or without physical materials. Some students also found it challenging to determine the level of detail required for their prototypes and how to develop a testing protocol.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced with CAD software, such as ""Students struggled to understand how to test and develop prototypes using CAD software, particularly when working remotely or without physical materials.""
2. Emphasize the need for more guidance on developing a testing protocol, such as ""Students sought clarification on how to develop a testing protocol for their prototypes, and some students felt that more examples or guidance would be helpful.""
3. Highlight the importance of clear instructions and examples, such as ""Students would benefit from clearer instructions and examples on how to use CAD software to develop and test prototypes, as well as guidance on how to determine the level of detail required for their prototypes.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand how to test and develop prototypes using CAD software, particularly when working remotely or without physical materials.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Gas Density to be clear and easy to understand, with some minor confusion regarding the inclusion of density in the in-class activity and its relevance to the calculation of carbon emissions. A few students also expressed a desire for more detail on the calculation of CO2 emissions and the impact of environmental factors on engineering decisions.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of Gas Density, rather than including general comments about the lecture. For example, the summary could start with ""Students generally found the concept of Gas Density to be clear and easy to understand..."" and then focus on the specific points related to Gas Density.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused. For example, instead of saying ""with some minor confusion regarding the inclusion of density in the in-class activity and its relevance to the calculation of carbon emissions"", the summary could simply state ""some students were unclear about the purpose of including density in the in-class activity"".
3. Consider highlighting the main points that students found confusing or unclear, and then summarizing the main takeaways or key points that students understood. For example, the summary could start with ""Students had some difficulty understanding the following points: [list specific points], but generally grasped the concept of Gas Density and its importance in engineering decisions"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of Gas Density to be clear and easy to understand, with some students unclear about the purpose of including density in the in-class activity.

Idea generation with my team","Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most prominent theme: While the original summary mentions biomimicry and idea generation, it could be further condensed to focus on the most prominent theme that emerged from the students' reflections, which is the fascination with using nature to create solutions to design problems. This could be done by removing some of the extraneous language and emphasizing the connection between biomimicry and idea generation.
2. Remove repetitive language: Some students mentioned the same ideas, such as the interest in biomimicry and idea generation. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the repetitive language and focusing on the unique insights and perspectives that each student brought to the topic.
3. Use more specific language: Instead of using general terms like ""interesting"" or ""fascinating,"" try to use more specific language to describe the students' reactions. For example, you could say that students were ""inspired"" or ""impressed"" by the examples of biomimicry, or that they found the idea generation techniques ""useful"" or ""practical."" This will make the summary more vivid and engaging.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were inspired by the concept of biomimicry, using nature to create innovative solutions to design problems, and found the video on beetle research particularly engaging. They appreciated the various methods for generating ideas, including brainstorming and iteration, and saw the potential for these techniques to be useful in their future engineering work."

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of iteration in tree traversal, particularly in Binary Search Trees (BST), to be interesting and intuitive. They appreciated the use of a stack to mimic the call stack in recursive functions, allowing for iterative versions of traversals such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order. The comparison between recursive and iterative approaches highlighted the equivalence in asymptotic runtime, making iterative solutions a viable alternative.

SUMMARY: Students found the setup process for Matlab Drive and submitting assignments and quizzes to be confusing, particularly with regards to downloading and opening files. Many students struggled with setting up their Matlab folders and understanding how to copy and open files in Matlab.

Suggestions:

1. Consider breaking down the setup process into smaller, more manageable steps to help students better understand the process of setting up Matlab Drive and submitting assignments and quizzes.
2. Provide more explicit instructions on how to download and open files in Matlab, including screenshots or visual aids to help students follow along.
3. Emphasize the importance of taking notes and following along with the instructor during the lecture, as some students reported feeling lost and struggling to keep up with the pace of the lecture.","Here is the refined summary:

I was a little confused on how to use MATLAB but I will poke around on it and get a baring for the program outside of class.
today's lecture was not confusing. I was unable to participate in the MATLAB onramp because of internet difficulties. I have ordered an Ethernet adapter so that I can stay connected in the future.

Students appreciated the visual representation of sets using diagrams and enjoyed exploring the relationships between set operators and previously learned concepts.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions: 

* Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of sets that students found interesting, such as the power set, nested sets, and Venn diagrams, rather than using general phrases like ""many highlighting the usefulness of Venn diagrams"". This would make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.
* Remove the phrase ""with some noting the connection to real-life situations and programming concepts"" as it is not a direct reflection of the students' thoughts and may make the summary seem more like an interpretation rather than a summary of the students' reflections.
* Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Students appreciated the visual representation of sets using diagrams"" to make it more concise, such as ""Students found Venn diagrams and other visual representations helpful in understanding sets"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the power set and nested sets particularly interesting, and appreciated the use of Venn diagrams and other visual representations to understand sets.

 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution

SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on phasers and graphs to be engaging and helpful in understanding the relationships between inductors, capacitors, and resistors. They appreciated the visual aids, such as the oscilloscope and phasor diagrams, which aided in grasping complex concepts like resonance and phase angles. Many students enjoyed the hands-on experiments and demonstrations, particularly the ones involving sin waves and the changing oscillating ammeter. The graphs and equations were found to be useful in visualizing and solving problems, and students appreciated the simplicity of the resonance frequency calculation using an oscilloscope.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of phasers and graphs that students found most helpful, such as the use of phasor diagrams or the visualization of sin waves. This would make the summary more concise and targeted to the topic.

For example: SUMMARY: Students found the use of phasor diagrams and the visualization of sin waves in the lecture on phasers and graphs to be particularly helpful in understanding the relationships between inductors, capacitors, and resistors.

2. Emphasize the key concepts that students found most interesting or surprising, such as the idea that a circuit in resonance can have a significant difference in voltage with small changes in frequency. This would make the summary more engaging and highlight the most important takeaways from the lecture.

For example: SUMMARY: Students found the concept of resonance in circuits to be fascinating, particularly the idea that a small change in frequency can result in a significant difference in voltage at resonance.

3. Consider combining similar ideas or phrases from the original reflections to create a more concise and cohesive summary. For example, the phrases ""visual aids"" and ""hands-on experiments"" could be combined into a single phrase, such as ""hands-on visual aids"", to make the summary more concise.
