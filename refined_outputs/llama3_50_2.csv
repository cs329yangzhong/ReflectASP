why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear. 
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz. 
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me. 
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?

1. Consider combining similar points: The original summary lists multiple points that are related to the same concept, such as the confusion about the equation 0.5cv^2 and the relationship between capacitance and shape. Combining these points into a single sentence could make the summary more concise and focused.
2. Emphasize the most common theme: The majority of the students' reflections revolve around the concept of capacitance and capacitors, particularly the relationship between capacitance and the shape of the conductor. Emphasizing this theme could make the summary more focused and relevant to the topic.
3. Avoid using vague terms: The original summary uses terms like ""challenging"" and ""difficult"" to describe the students' struggles. Consider using more specific language to describe the exact areas where students are struggling, such as ""confusion about the equation 0.5cv^2"" or ""difficulty understanding the concept of dielectrics weakening the electric field"".

I found the balloon tophat question most interesting about today's class because I thought too hard about it at first and once it was explained it was an “ah” moment
I found the balloon example interesting because it tied what we were learning to a more real world experience/possibility 
The rc circuit stuff
The equation for magnetic fields on point chargesThe equation for magnetic fields on point charges
It's interesting how the current of an RC circuit is essentially a fraction of the original current dependant on the time constant. 
I enjoy learning about magnets, their properties and their fields
I found the magnetic field lines interesting because no matter how small they get they will always have a north and a south end. 
I thought it was really interesting that capacitors ALL charge at the same “rate” which is RC seconds. Also found it interesting that capacitors are never fully charged. the graph was a good representation of this since I feel most of us are very familiar what an asymptote is and what it represents as a graphical function 
Magnetic field lines and  multiloop circuits 
 The rc time unit was interesting. 
 I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered! 
 How you can split up multi loop circuits into separate branches 
 I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
 It was neat how we used the very basic loop rule to build up to a separable differential equation that solves q(t).
 I thought it was interesting how we have never been able to create a magnet with the same poles. Especially since it has the possibility to be useful for technology. 
 It's interesting how electrons move in circular motion around a magnetic field. Also it is interesting how many times we use the cross product.

In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well. 
 I think the tophat questions overall were the most difficult part about class. ",36,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.

SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of dipoles in a uniform electric field, particularly with calculating moments and identifying the direction of the electric force. Some students found the top hat questions challenging and requested more in-depth explanations. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the physical properties of electric fields and how they relate to electric force.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more specifically on the difficulties students had with calculating moments for dipoles in a uniform electric field, as this seems to be a major area of confusion. This could be done by rephrasing the summary to highlight the need for more guidance on this topic.
* Remove the mention of ""top hat questions"" and instead focus on the more general issue of students requesting more in-depth explanations, as this is a broader concern that is not specific to the uniform electric field topic.
* Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight the importance of understanding the physical properties of electric fields and how they relate to electric force, as this seems to be a key area of confusion for many students.","Here is the refined summary:

SUMMARY: Students enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of today's lecture, particularly the application of kinematic equations to real-world scenarios, such as the dinosaur problem and free fall motion. They appreciated the opportunity to rearrange and substitute equations to solve for different variables, and found the connections to calculus and graphing to be particularly interesting. Many students also enjoyed the interactive breakout rooms and top hat questions, which helped to reinforce their understanding of the material.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most prominent theme: While the original summary mentions several aspects of the lecture, it could be more concise by focusing on the most prominent theme, which is the problem-solving aspect. For example, the summary could start with ""Students enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of today's lecture, which was highlighted by the application of kinematic equations to real-world scenarios...""
2. Use more specific language: The original summary uses general phrases like ""real-world scenarios"" and ""connections to calculus and graphing.""

The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult. 
The first problem, particularly finding how the thrower and the kicker relate
I guess the test, not sure if my group got it right. Otherwise great experience 7/10 would try again. 
The first problem with the football was definitely confusing, but my group mates and I figured it out
Questions were very hard compared to study guide. Studied concepts but could not figure out problems.
Exam was tough. fair. VERY tough
I thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1.
We had an exam today I thought question 1 was confusing. I had trouble with it
There was no lecture today. 
Test was kinda hard but not bad, nice to have the ppl to help you
 I felt like the exam was overall pretty good. This first part was a little more confusing than the second for me, although my group mates had trouble with the second.

For example, ""The majority of students found the first problem on the exam challenging, with many struggling to interpret the time-related aspects.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""Some students felt that the questions were harder than the study guide suggested"" as it's not directly related to the topic of confusion and might make the summary seem less focused.","REFINED SUMMARY: The first problem on the exam was particularly confusing, with many students struggling to interpret the time-related aspects.

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.

I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally enjoyed the TopHat questions, finding them engaging and interactive, which helped keep them focused during the lecture. Many appreciated the real-world applications and visual aids, such as the monkey problem and video, which made complex concepts like projectile motion and relative velocity more accessible and memorable. The students also appreciated the group work and breakout rooms, which allowed them to collaborate and work through problems together.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of the TopHat questions that students enjoyed, such as the real-world applications, visual aids, and interactive nature, rather than generalizing that they ""enjoyed"" them. For example, the summary could highlight that students appreciated the ""real-world applications"" and ""visual aids"" that made complex concepts more accessible.
2. Emphasize the impact of the TopHat questions on student engagement and learning, such as ""The TopHat questions helped keep students focused and engaged during the lecture"" or ""The interactive nature of the TopHat questions facilitated a deeper understanding of complex concepts"".
3. Consider breaking the summary into two separate paragraphs, one focusing on the benefits of the TopHat questions and another highlighting the specific features that students appreciated. This could help to provide a clearer and more concise summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: The TopHat questions effectively engaged students, making complex concepts like projectile motion and relative velocity more accessible and memorable.

It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of the in-class problems that students found engaging and interactive, such as the use of breakout rooms and Top Hat questions, rather than general statements about the hands-on approach to learning. For example, the summary could highlight the benefits of working in groups and receiving immediate feedback, rather than simply stating that the hands-on approach was engaging.

2. Emphasize the specific ways in which the in-class problems helped students develop problem-solving skills and build confidence in their understanding of the material, rather than making general statements about the value of the experience. For example, the summary could highlight the ways in which the problems helped students develop their ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-life scenarios, or how they improved their ability to work collaboratively with peers.

3. Consider using more specific and concrete language to describe the students' experiences, rather than relying on general terms like ""engaging"" and ""interactive."" For example, the summary could describe the students' experiences as ""challenging and thought-provoking,"" or ""fun and collaborative."" This would help to create a more vivid and memorable summary that better captures the essence of the students' experiences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the in-class problems particularly engaging and interactive, citing the use of breakout rooms and Top Hat questions as highlights. They appreciated the opportunity to work in groups, discuss with peers, and receive immediate feedback, which helped them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence in their understanding of the material. The variety of problem types, including word problems and real-life applications, was also praised for making the material more relatable and interesting."

 Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
 The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don't understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.

Students struggled to understand the 3 Blocks Example, particularly the concept of two tensions in the pulley system and setting up free body diagrams. Many found it challenging to grasp why the force needed to hold the man still was only the tension in the rope, and how the tension doubles when the rope is pulled down on the pulley.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the key point that the tension in the rope is not the only force acting on the man, but rather the force needed to hold him still. This could be emphasized by using a visual aid or example to illustrate this concept.
2. Provide more guidance on how to set up free body diagrams for complex problems like the 3 Blocks Example. This could include step-by-step instructions or examples of how to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
3. Emphasize the importance of understanding the concept of tension and its application to real-world problems. This could be done by providing additional examples or case studies that demonstrate the relevance and importance of tension in everyday life.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the 3 Blocks Example, particularly the concept of two tensions in the pulley system and setting up free body diagrams.

They enjoyed the interactive nature of the lecture, including the top hat questions and breakout room discussions, which helped them understand the relationship between normal force and friction. Many students found it interesting to learn that surface area does not affect the force of friction, and that the coefficient of friction is usually smaller than 1. The concept of cold welds and atomic interactions causing friction was also a highlight for many students.

I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another. 
 projectile motion is still confusing

Summary: Students found the concept of tension forces challenging, particularly in understanding the direction of tension forces and how to apply them in problems. Many students struggled with the salami question and the tug of war problem, and some found it difficult to visualize the tension forces in ropes. Students also mentioned that they needed more practice with tension problems and more examples with different directions of tension.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar points, such as the struggles with the salami question and the tug of war problem, into a single sentence. For example: ""Students struggled with applying tension forces in problems, particularly with the salami question and the tug of war problem.""
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific challenges students faced with tension forces, rather than simply stating that they found it challenging. For example: ""Students struggled to understand the direction of tension forces and how to apply them in problems, leading to difficulties with the salami question and the tug of war problem.""
3. To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence about students appreciating the thorough explanation of the math behind tension forces. While this is a positive comment, it is not directly related to the topic of tension problems.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the direction of tension forces and how to apply them in problems, particularly with the salami question and the tug of war problem.

What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.

 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.

They appreciated the opportunity to relate centripetal force to conceptual ideas and enjoyed learning about the drag force and its impact on acceleration.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the specific examples that students found most interesting, such as the terminal velocity of objects in air and water, to provide a clearer picture of what aspects of centripetal force problems resonated with them.
2. Emphasize the connection between centripetal force and real-life applications, as students seemed to appreciate the relevance of the concept to everyday situations.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more specifically on the students' experiences with centripetal force problems, rather than mentioning ""real-life applications"" in a more general sense. For example, ""Students enjoyed working through centripetal force problems and appreciated the opportunity to apply the concept to scenarios such as terminal velocity in air and water.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found centripetal force problems engaging, particularly those involving terminal velocity in air and water, and appreciated relating the concept to real-life scenarios.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",74,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).

* To make the summary more concise, consider combining the first two sentences into one: ""Students generally found the Right-Hand Rule clear, but some needed more practice to fully understand its application and visualize it on a 2D graph.""
* To make the summary more focused on the topic, consider removing the sentence about the cross product, as it is not directly related to the Right-Hand Rule. Instead, focus on the students' struggles with visualizing the rule on a 2D graph and their need for more practice.
* Consider adding a sentence to highlight the students' request for more examples and clarification on when to apply the Right-Hand Rule in physics.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the Right-Hand Rule clear, but some needed more practice to fully understand its application and visualize it on a 2D graph.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end

I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult.","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students were generally confused about the dinosaur problem, specifically with determining the direction of acceleration and how to set up the kinematic equations. Some students found the problem with the two dinosaurs accelerating at different rates challenging to understand, while others were confused about how to use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of acceleration. Additionally, some students struggled with understanding the concept of negative and positive directions in the context of the problem.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more specifically on the main point of confusion, which is the direction of acceleration, rather than mentioning the entire dinosaur problem. For example: ""Students struggled to determine the direction of acceleration in the dinosaur problem, with some finding it challenging to understand how to set up the kinematic equations and others confused about the concept of negative and positive directions.""
2. Consider breaking the summary into two separate points to highlight the two main areas of confusion: the direction of acceleration and the setup of kinematic equations. For example: ""Students struggled with two main aspects of the dinosaur problem: determining the direction of acceleration and setting up the kinematic equations. Some students found it challenging to understand how to determine the direction of acceleration, while others struggled to set up the equations correctly.""
3. Consider using more concise language to convey the main points of confusion. For example, instead of saying ""some students found the problem with the two dinosaurs accelerating at different rates challenging to understand"", simply say ""students struggled to understand how to handle different acceleration rates in the dinosaur problem"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to determine the direction of acceleration in the dinosaur problem, with some finding it challenging to understand how to set up kinematic equations and others confused about negative and positive directions."

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems

SUMMARY: Students found relative motion challenging, particularly when deciding when to add or subtract vectors. Many struggled with conceptualizing relative speed, especially when dealing with objects moving at different velocities. The monkey and bullet example was a common point of confusion, and students requested more practice problems and examples to solidify their understanding.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific struggles students had with relative motion, such as understanding when to add or subtract vectors, and conceptualizing relative speed. The current summary is a bit too general and could be more specific.
2. Consider breaking the summary into two paragraphs, one for the conceptual struggles and one for the specific example that caused confusion (the monkey and bullet example). This would make the summary more organized and easier to follow.
3. Avoid using vague phrases like ""many students found it challenging"" and instead try to provide more specific examples or quotes from the students to illustrate their struggles. This would make the summary more concrete and engaging.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with relative motion, particularly when deciding when to add or subtract vectors.

Some students also found it difficult to visualize the direction of resultant vectors and how to draw them correctly.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year.

 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Here is a concise summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Vector Math:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Vector Math clear and easy to follow, with some minor areas of confusion. Many students struggled with understanding when to add or subtract vectors, particularly when dealing with angles and trigonometry. Some students also found it difficult to visualize the direction of resultant vectors and how to draw them correctly. Additionally, there was some confusion regarding the use of unit vectors and when to add or subtract them.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the concept of angles and trigonometry in relation to vector addition and subtraction. This could be done by providing more examples and practice problems that focus on these concepts.
2. Provide more visual aids and diagrams to help students visualize the direction of resultant vectors and how to draw them correctly. This could include using different colors or symbols to represent different vectors and their directions.
3. Clarify the use of unit vectors and when to add or subtract them. This could be done by providing more examples and practice problems that demonstrate the application of unit vectors in different scenarios.
4. Encourage students to practice and review the concepts of vector addition and subtraction regularly to solidify their understanding. This could be done by providing additional practice problems or quizzes that focus on these concepts.","Here is a revised summary that incorporates the suggestions:

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.

 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after.

I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning ofthe lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after Iused it for the first question I got the hang of it.
For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract.
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Here is a summary of the focused topic, TopHat Question, in 50 words:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat questions challenging, particularly with timing and submission. Some struggled with identifying when to add or subtract vectors, while others appreciated the visual aids and examples. The majority of students found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with minor confusion on specific topics.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions on the TopHat submission process, including timing and formatting requirements, to reduce student confusion.
2. Consider offering additional practice opportunities or review sessions to help students become more comfortable with the TopHat format and timing.
3. Emphasize the importance of carefully reading and understanding the question prompt before submitting an answer to reduce errors and improve accuracy.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat questions challenging, particularly with timing and submission.

Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially those involving stacked blocks, frictionless surfaces, and combining forces. Some students were confused about the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the coefficient of friction in different scenarios. Others had difficulty understanding how to set up free body diagrams and combine forces in complex systems.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Two Blocks/Forces/Systems:

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and friction. Many students struggled with the top hat questions, especially those involving stacked blocks, frictionless surfaces, and combining forces. Some students were confused about the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the coefficient of friction in different scenarios.

Suggestions:

1. Clarify the concept of static and kinetic friction, and provide more examples of how to apply the coefficient of friction in different scenarios. This could include real-world examples, such as the difference between static and kinetic friction in everyday situations.
2. Provide more guidance on how to set up free body diagrams and combine forces in complex systems. This could include step-by-step instructions or examples of how to break down complex problems into simpler components.
3. Offer more practice problems that involve two blocks/forces/systems, with a focus on applying the concepts learned in class. This could include a mix of problems that involve different types of friction, such as static and kinetic friction, as well as problems that involve combining forces in different ways.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of two blocks/forces/systems challenging, particularly when dealing with multiple forces and friction.

Some students also found it difficult to understand the difference between static and kinetic friction, and how to apply the concept of maximum frictional force (fs,max). Additionally, students would benefit from more practice in creating equivalent problems and diagrams that make it easier to solve.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points about students' struggles with FBDs into a single sentence. For example: ""Students found FBDs clear, but struggled to apply them to complex problems, particularly those involving multiple forces and friction, and had difficulty determining the correct forces to include in the FBD, especially when dealing with frictional forces.""
2. Emphasize the specific areas where students need more practice, such as creating equivalent problems and diagrams. For example: ""Students would benefit from more practice in creating equivalent problems and diagrams that make it easier to solve, as well as more examples of applying FBDs to complex problems involving friction.""
3. Consider adding a sentence highlighting the importance of understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction, as this was a common area of confusion for students. For example: ""Understanding the difference between static and kinetic friction is crucial for accurately applying FBDs, and students would benefit from more clarification on this concept.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) clear, but struggled to apply them to complex problems, particularly those involving multiple forces and friction.

I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Assignment 13 straightforward and clear, with some minor areas of confusion regarding the project specifications, energy calculations, and the need for more guidance on what variables and processes to include in their charts.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary by focusing on the most common areas of confusion, such as the project specifications and energy calculations, and omitting the phrase ""with some minor areas of confusion"". This would make the summary more concise and focused on the main points.

2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more specific and concrete. For example, instead of saying ""need for more guidance on what variables and processes to include in their charts"", it could say ""need for more clarity on what specific variables and processes to include in their charts"".

3. Consider adding more detail to the summary by highlighting the specific aspects of Assignment 13 that students found confusing, such as the rubric and the economic aspects of the project. This would provide a more comprehensive overview of the areas where students needed more guidance.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Assignment 13 straightforward, with some areas of confusion regarding project specifications, energy calculations, and the need for more guidance on specific variables and processes to include in charts.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units clear and straightforward, with most reporting no confusion or only minor issues. Some students requested more details on specific topics, such as the process of making graphs, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the calculation of energy units. Others appreciated the clarity of the lecture and the provision of sufficient information for the project.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:
1. Consider condensing the summary by focusing on the most common theme or issue among the students' reflections. For example, the majority of students reported no confusion or only minor issues, so the summary could start with a statement like ""Students generally found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units clear and straightforward.""
2. Emphasize the specific topics that students requested more details on, such as the process of making graphs, the environmental impact of carbon energy, and the calculation of energy units. This could help the instructor identify areas that need more attention or clarification in future lectures.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight the positive aspects of the lecture, such as the clarity of the presentation or the provision of sufficient information for the project. This could help balance out the summary and provide a more comprehensive overview of the students' reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Energy Calculations and Units clear and straightforward, with most reporting no confusion or only minor issues.

To improve the summary, consider focusing more on the specific points of confusion, such as the discrepancy between the numbers in the PowerPoint slides and Brightspace activity, rather than just stating that some students were confused. This would provide more concrete information for the instructor to address.
2. Consider breaking the summary into two separate points: one for the confusion related to the numbers and one for the conversion process. This would make the summary more concise and easier to follow.
3. Emphasize the majority of students understanding the concept, as this is a positive aspect of the lecture, and provide more detail on what they found straightforward. This would provide a more balanced view of the lecture and highlight the students' overall understanding of the topic.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the CO2 emission calculations straightforward, with most understanding the concept.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Midterm/Exam to be straightforward and easy to follow, with most reporting that they understood the material. However, some students were confused about the calculation of carbon emissions due to discrepancies between the slide presentation and the in-class activity.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of double-checking numbers and formulas during in-class activities to avoid confusion. This could be done by having students work in pairs or small groups to verify calculations and catch any errors.
2. Provide more explicit instructions on the format and numbers used in in-class participation slides to avoid confusion. This could include providing a clear example or demonstration of how to calculate carbon emissions.
3. Consider providing additional support or resources for students who are struggling with the calculation of carbon emissions, such as online tutorials or practice problems.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Midterm/Exam to be straightforward, with most reporting understanding the material.

SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture clear and easy to follow, with many stating that the instructor's explanations were helpful and the class was well-organized. Some students mentioned that they would have liked more information on the BikeShare project, the course schedule, and the use of Brightspace, but overall, the class was considered straightforward and easy to understand.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

SUMMARY: Students found Assignment 12 (A12) to be engaging and interesting, with many appreciating the opportunity to apply real engineering practices and work in breakout rooms with their teams. They enjoyed using Excel to analyze data and calculate instantaneous rates of change, and found the reservoir power equation and unit conversions to be particularly fascinating. Many students also appreciated the time spent working on the project, feeling that it helped their team get on the same page and develop a good understanding of the assignment.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of Assignment 12 that students found most engaging, such as the use of Excel to analyze data or the application of real engineering practices. This could help to make the summary more concise and targeted to the topic.
2. Remove the phrase ""with many appreciating"" and instead use more specific language to describe the students' reactions. For example, ""Students found the use of Excel to analyze data and calculate instantaneous rates of change to be particularly fascinating.""
3. Consider rephrasing the sentence ""Many students also appreciated the time spent working on the project, feeling that it helped their team get on the same page and develop a good understanding of the assignment."" to focus more on the specific benefits of the breakout room experience, such as ""Students reported that the time spent working in breakout rooms helped their teams develop a better understanding of the assignment and collaborate more effectively.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Assignment 12 (A12) engaging, particularly when applying real engineering practices and using Excel to analyze data and calculate instantaneous rates of change.

SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process engaging, as it allowed them to consider various perspectives, stakeholders, and users. They appreciated the opportunity to work on the project in class, which helped them develop a deeper understanding of the problem and generate many ideas for potential solutions.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus specifically on the problem scoping process, rather than mentioning the overall engagement and enthusiasm of the students. For example: ""Students found the problem scoping process engaging, as it allowed them to consider various perspectives and stakeholders.""
2. Remove the phrase ""which helped them develop a deeper understanding of the problem"" as it is implied by the fact that they were working on the project. Instead, focus on the outcome of the process, such as ""and generate many ideas for potential solutions.""

I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work.

It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the carbon footprint calculations and activity to be a thought-provoking and engaging experience. Many were surprised by the large impact their individual carbon footprint has on the environment, with some noting that it was ""crazy"" or ""interesting"" to see how much energy they use. The use of visual aids, such as the ""how many earths"" calculator, helped students understand the scale of their impact. The activity also sparked discussions about the importance of considering ethics in engineering and the need to reduce carbon emissions.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of the carbon footprint calculations and activity that students found interesting or surprising, rather than providing a general summary of the experience. For example, the summary could highlight the specific statistics or visual aids that students found most impactful, such as the ""how many earths"" calculator.

2. Emphasize the connection between the carbon footprint activity and the broader topic of engineering and sustainability. For example, the summary could highlight how the activity helped students understand the importance of considering environmental impact in their future careers as engineers.

3. Consider breaking the summary into two separate paragraphs, one focusing on the students' reactions to the activity and the other focusing on the specific aspects of the activity itself. This could help to provide a clearer and more focused summary of the students' experiences and insights.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were surprised by the large impact of their individual carbon footprint on the environment, with many finding it ""crazy"" or ""interesting"" to see how much energy they use.

It would have let us keep our train of thought

I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.

For example, ""Students struggled to understand the practical application of the Laminar Approach, particularly in assignment A10, and felt that more examples and detail would have been helpful.""
2. Emphasize the specific areas of confusion that students experienced, such as the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values, to provide a clearer picture of the challenges students faced.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight any positive aspects of the lecture, such as the clarity of the instructor's explanation or the helpfulness of the examples provided, to provide a more balanced summary. For example, ""While some students struggled with the practical application of the Laminar Approach, the instructor's clear explanation and examples helped to clarify the concept for many students.""","REFINED SUMMARY: The majority of students found the lecture on the Laminar Approach to be challenging, with many expressing confusion regarding its practical application, particularly in assignment A10. Students struggled to understand the use of SSE, SST, and r^2 values, and felt that more examples and detail would have been helpful to clarify the concept. Despite these challenges, the instructor's clear explanation and examples helped to clarify the Laminar Approach for many students, and some students appreciated the opportunity to work in groups to discuss and resolve their questions."

I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Power Calculation clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion. However, some students struggled with converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding the relationship between height and pressure. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the process for calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir and how to use Excel for the in-class quiz.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most common points of confusion: Instead of mentioning that most students found the lecture clear, focus on the specific points that caused confusion, such as converting units, calculating pressure head, and understanding the relationship between height and pressure. This will provide a more accurate representation of the students' understanding.
2. Avoid using vague phrases: Phrases like ""some students struggled"" and ""a few students were unclear"" can be vague and don't provide specific information. Consider rephrasing to provide more concrete numbers or examples.
3. Emphasize the most critical points: The original summary mentions several points of confusion, but some are more critical to understanding Power Calculation than others. Consider highlighting the most critical points, such as calculating pressure head and total power for the Upper Reservoir, to provide a more focused summary.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with converting units and calculating pressure head, with some also finding it challenging to understand the relationship between height and pressure. Additionally, a few students were unclear about the process for calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir. These areas of confusion highlight the need for further review and practice to ensure a strong understanding of Power Calculation principles."

 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers.

 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more specifically on the assignment explanations and descriptions, rather than including general comments about the in-class assignment and calculations. For example, the summary could start with ""Students found the assignment descriptions and instructions unclear, particularly for Assignment 10, and would have appreciated more guidance on creating mathematical models and simplifying diagrams.""
2. Emphasize the most common areas of confusion, such as the laminar approach and mathematical models, rather than listing multiple areas of confusion. This could help to make the summary more concise and focused.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to highlight any common themes or patterns in the student reflections, such as the need for more examples or guidance on how to apply the mathematical concepts to real-world problems. This could help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' needs and concerns.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Assignment 10's descriptions and instructions unclear, particularly regarding mathematical models and simplifying diagrams.

 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms. 
 I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could've been a could idea.

 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.

SUMMARY: Students found the Laminar Approach topic confusing, particularly in understanding how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models. Some students struggled with the in-class assignment, feeling uncertain about which variables to use and how to find them.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the main points, such as ""Students found the Laminar Approach topic confusing, particularly in understanding how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models."" This would make the summary more concise and to the point.
2. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more specific and concrete. For example, instead of saying ""some students struggled with the in-class assignment"", you could say ""students struggled with identifying the correct variables to use and finding them in the in-class assignment"".
3. Consider adding more nuance to the summary by highlighting the range of student experiences and perspectives. For example, you could say ""While some students found the Laminar Approach topic challenging, others were able to understand it with some guidance and examples"". This would give a more accurate representation of the diversity of student experiences.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the Laminar Approach topic confusing, particularly in understanding how to derive mathematical equations from tables and create mathematical models.

Taum sauk failure","Summary: Students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures to be insightful, highlighting the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in engineering projects. The reservoir's flaws, including oversights in design and land surveying, led to catastrophic consequences. Students appreciated the real-world example of how small mistakes can have devastating effects and the importance of learning from failures to improve future projects.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, rather than mentioning ""engineering projects"" in general. For example: ""Students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures to be insightful, highlighting the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in the design and construction of the reservoir.""
2. Emphasize the specific flaws that contributed to the reservoir's failure, such as oversights in design and land surveying, to make the summary more concise and focused.
3. Consider removing the phrase ""small mistakes can have devastating effects"" as it is not specific to the Tom Sauk Reservoir and is a general statement. Instead, focus on the specific consequences of the reservoir's failure, such as the catastrophic consequences it led to.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures to be insightful, highlighting the importance of proper ethics, communication, and attention to detail in the design and construction of the reservoir.

 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",305,"The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusingbecause it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came tocalculations.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, sinceit wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum SaukReservoir project.
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the lecture about Tom Sauk Reservoir:

Summary: Students generally found the lecture on Tom Sauk Reservoir clear, with some minor confusion regarding the technical brief and assignment 10. Specifically, students were unclear about the expectations for including constraints in the technical brief, the mathematical modeling requirements for assignment 10, and the use of the Laminar Approach in the assignment.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more detailed explanations and examples of the Laminar Approach and how to apply it to the assignment, as some students struggled to understand the concept.
2. Clarify the expectations for including constraints in the technical brief and provide more guidance on how to approach this aspect of the assignment.
3. Offer more support and resources for students who are struggling with the mathematical modeling requirements for assignment 10, such as providing additional examples or tutorials.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Tom Sauk Reservoir clear, with some minor confusion regarding the technical brief and assignment 10.

Additionally, some students struggled with understanding the concept of laminar approach and its application in the assignment.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Seeing Climate Change
Original Summary: Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Seeing Climate Change:

SUMMARY: Students were engaged by the discussion on carbon emissions and their impact on the environment, with many finding it surprising to learn about their own vehicles' CO2 emissions. The concept of trade-offs was also a highlight, as students appreciated its relevance to engineering design. The in-class activity and interactive website allowed students to visualize and understand their personal carbon footprint.

Suggestions:

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

3. Emphasize the importance of understanding z-scores: Z-scores are a crucial concept in statistics, and students need to understand how to apply them to real-world problems. Emphasizing the importance of z-scores and providing more examples and practice problems could help students better grasp this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were mixed in their understanding of the Skittles Example, with some finding it confusing and others grasping it well. Key areas of confusion included the transition from numerical to percentage values on the x-axis, the application of z-scores, and the connection to probability concepts.

SUMMARY: Students were fascinated by the concept of biomimicry, where humans use nature to create innovative solutions to design problems. They found the examples of biomimicry, such as the snake's ability to adapt to its environment, and the beetle's strong force-resistant shells, to be particularly interesting and inspiring. The students also appreciated the idea generation techniques discussed in class, including the use of brainstorming and iteration, and recognized the importance of these skills in engineering.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more specifically on the topic of biomimicry, rather than including general comments about idea generation techniques. For example, the summary could focus on the students' reactions to the examples of biomimicry presented in class, such as the snake's adaptability and the beetle's shells.
* Try to condense the summary to make it more concise. For example, the phrase ""they found the examples of biomimicry... to be particularly interesting and inspiring"" could be shortened to simply ""students were fascinated by the biomimicry examples"".
* Consider using more precise language to describe the students' reactions. For example, instead of saying ""they found it interesting"", the summary could say ""students were amazed by the innovative solutions inspired by nature"" or ""students were impressed by the adaptability of the snake and the beetle"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were fascinated by the concept of biomimicry, particularly the innovative solutions inspired by nature, such as the snake's adaptability and the beetle's strong force-resistant shells.

SUMMARY: Students found the discussion on design trade-offs and the concept of carbon footprints to be particularly interesting and relevant to their understanding of engineering. They appreciated the practical application of trade-offs in real-world scenarios, such as calculating the carbon emissions of their own vehicles.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more specifically on the concept of trade-offs, rather than including the broader topic of carbon footprints. This would allow for a more targeted discussion of the students' reflections on trade-offs.
2. Emphasize the practical applications of trade-offs in the summary, as this was a key aspect that resonated with the students. For example, you could highlight the ways in which trade-offs are used in real-world engineering scenarios to balance competing factors and make informed decisions.
3. Consider using more concise language in the summary to make it more easily digestible. For example, you could eliminate some of the repetitive language and focus on the most important points that the students made.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of trade-offs to be particularly interesting and relevant to their understanding of engineering.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Criteria and Constraints/Stakeholders to be clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion or difficulties. However, some students struggled with understanding the distinction between criteria and constraints, and how to identify and incorporate stakeholders into the project.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the key differences between criteria and constraints in the lecture, and providing more concrete examples to help students understand the distinction.
2. Provide more guidance on how to identify and prioritize stakeholders, and how to incorporate their needs and concerns into the project.
3. Clarify the scope of the project, particularly regarding the background information and data collection, to help students better understand what is expected of them.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Criteria and Constraints/Stakeholders clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no confusion.

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz.

Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible.

 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.

Design process
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future

 I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
 I thought the beetle video was interesting because it was happening at Purdue and the way nature adapted was cool.
 Using Google to find patents and how it is all public information. 
 I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
 Even though the use of biomimicry was a little confusing, I did find how it was used in the video to be incredibly interesting!
 I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class. 
 The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering. 
 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before. 
 It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
 The prompt for the quiz was interesting.
 I enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of beetle shells used to make very strong force resistant shells.
 I found the idea iteration studio time interesting because it was fun to brainstorm possible solutions.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Biomimicry
Original Summary: SUMMARY: Students found the concept of biomimry fascinating, particularly the examples of how nature-inspired solutions are being used to address design problems. They appreciated the hands-on activities, such as brainstorming and idea generation, and enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of animals like snakes and beetles. The students also found the idea of using public patent information and Google to find inspiration for solutions to be a valuable tool. Overall, the topic of biomimicry sparked their interest and provided a unique approach to problem-solving.

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific examples of biomimicry mentioned in the reflections, such as the snake and beetle, to make the summary more concrete and engaging. For example, the summary could highlight the students' fascination with the biomimicry of snake scales or the beetle's shell.
2. Emphasize the students' enthusiasm for the hands-on activities, such as brainstorming and idea generation, and how these activities helped them develop a deeper understanding of biomimicry. This could be done by highlighting the students' appreciation for the interactive nature of the class.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and focused on the topic of biomimicry. For example, instead of saying ""the topic of biomimicry sparked their interest and provided a unique approach to problem-solving,"" the summary could simply state ""students found biomimicry fascinating and appreciated its innovative approach to problem-solving.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were captivated by the concept of biomimicry, particularly the examples of how nature-inspired solutions, such as the snake's scales and beetle's shell, are being used to address design problems. They enjoyed the hands-on activities, including brainstorming and idea generation, which helped them develop a deeper understanding of biomimicry's innovative approach to problem-solving."

Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not

Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.

 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.
 I was confused as to how indepth the pro's and con's diagram should be. 
 The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.

2. Emphasize the importance of the color flip: The color flip operation is a crucial aspect of Red-Black BSTs, and it would be beneficial to highlight its significance in the summary. For example, the summary could mention that students understood the importance of color flip in maintaining the tree's balance and correcting violations.
3. Clarify the scope of the discussion: The original summary mentions ""deleting nodes"" in a Red-Black BST, but it would be helpful to specify that this refers to the deletion of nodes with 1 or 2 children, as this is a specific scenario that was discussed in the lecture.","Here is the refined summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most common areas of confusion: While the original summary mentions multiple areas of confusion, it could be condensed to focus on the most common ones, such as the use of MATLAB functions and the level of detail required for pseudo-code. This would make the summary more concise and targeted.
2. Avoid using vague phrases: Phrases like ""some minor areas of confusion"" and ""expressed a desire for more information"" are vague and don't provide specific details. The summary could be improved by providing more concrete examples or quotes from students to illustrate the points.
3. Use more specific language: The summary could benefit from using more specific language to describe the areas of confusion, such as ""confusion around the application of specific MATLAB functions"" or ""uncertainty about the level of detail required for pseudo-code"".
