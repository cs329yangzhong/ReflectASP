SUMMARY: Students struggled with setting up problems involving potential energy, particularly with choosing bounds for integrals and understanding the relationship between electric fields and potential. They also found it challenging to differentiate between voltage, potential energy, and regular voltage, and had difficulty with partial derivatives and calculating potential from electric fields.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more specifically on the struggles with setting up integrals for potential energy, as this seems to be a major area of confusion for students. For example, the summary could mention that students had trouble choosing bounds for integrals or understanding how to apply the concept of potential energy to real-world problems.
* Emphasize the importance of clarifying the relationship between electric fields and potential, as this seems to be a key area of confusion for students. The summary could highlight the need for more explicit explanations or examples to help students understand how electric fields relate to potential.
* Consider breaking down the summary into more specific, concrete points, rather than grouping multiple concepts together. For example, the summary could address the struggles with voltage, potential energy, and regular voltage separately, rather than combining them into a single sentence. This could help to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of potential.","Here is a revised summary that incorporates the suggestions:

I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.

 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.

 I found it confusing defining what C equivalence was. ",35,"Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.
I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.
Series capacitors and resistance
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused.
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on capacitors clear, with some minor areas of confusion. Key points of confusion included the relationship between charge density, electric field, and current density, as well as the simplification of circuit diagrams with multiple branches.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider combining the points of confusion related to circuit diagrams and capacitors in series/parallel into a single sentence, as they are related topics. For example: ""Students struggled with simplifying circuit diagrams with multiple branches, particularly when determining whether capacitors are in parallel or series.""
* Emphasize the specific areas of confusion, such as the relationship between charge density, electric field, and current density, rather than just stating that students found it confusing. For example: ""Students had difficulty understanding the relationship between charge density, electric field, and current density, and how these concepts interact.""
* Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific concepts and less on the general statement that students found the lecture clear. For example: ""The lecture on capacitors introduced key concepts such as charge density, electric field, and current density, but students struggled to understand their relationships and how to apply them to circuit diagrams.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had difficulty understanding the relationship between charge density, electric field, and current density, and how these concepts interact.

I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!","Here is the original summary:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the TopHat questions engaging and helpful in learning the material, particularly the monkey problem, which was considered interesting and easy to understand. Many students appreciated the visual aids, such as the video demonstration of the monkey problem, and enjoyed the group work and breakout rooms. The concept of independent horizontal and vertical motions in projectile motion was also a major point of interest, with students finding it fascinating and easy to grasp.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific aspects of TopHat questions that students found engaging, such as ""engaging and helpful in learning the material"" and ""interesting and easy to understand"". This will make the summary more concise and targeted to the topic.
2. Consider combining similar points, such as ""visual aids"" and ""group work and breakout rooms"", into a single sentence to reduce repetition and improve flow.
3. Emphasize the key concept that students found most interesting, which is the concept of independent horizontal and vertical motions in projectile motion. This will make the summary more focused and highlight the main takeaway from the lecture.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found TopHat questions engaging and helpful in learning material, particularly the monkey problem, which was considered interesting and easy to understand.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.

I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.

 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring.

 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.

 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.

SUMMARY: Students found the 3 Blocks Example challenging, particularly in understanding the concept of tension and its relationship with the pulley system. Many struggled to set up free body diagrams, especially when dealing with multiple objects and forces. Some students were confused about why tension is doubled when the rope is pulled through the pulley and how to apply this concept to real-world scenarios.

Suggestions:

1. Consider highlighting the key concept of tension being a force that is always directed along the direction of the rope, which might help clarify why it's represented as a positive force. This could also help students understand why it's doubled when the rope is pulled through the pulley.
2. Emphasize the importance of carefully identifying the system boundaries and defining the forces acting on each object when setting up free body diagrams, especially when dealing with multiple objects and forces.
3. Provide more examples or case studies that demonstrate the application of tension in real-world scenarios, such as the man lifting himself up with the pulley, to help students better understand and visualize the concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the 3 Blocks Example challenging, particularly in understanding the concept of tension and its relationship with the pulley system.

 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside

 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?

Original Summary: Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Newton's Laws, focusing on the concept of tension forces:

SUMMARY: Students generally found the concept of tension forces to be challenging, with many expressing confusion about how to visualize and apply tension forces in different scenarios. Some students struggled to understand why tensions don't add up when forces are acting in different directions, while others found it difficult to determine the direction of tension forces.

Suggestions:

1. Consider breaking down the concept of tension forces into smaller, more manageable chunks, such as focusing on a specific scenario (e.g., a rope being pulled) and then gradually introducing more complex scenarios. This could help students build a stronger foundation for understanding tension forces.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to draw free body diagrams and label forces correctly. This could include providing examples of correct and incorrect diagrams, as well as encouraging students to practice drawing their own diagrams.
3. Emphasize the importance of considering the direction of tension forces in different scenarios. This could involve providing more examples of how tension forces act in different directions and encouraging students to think critically about the direction of forces in different situations.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the concept of tension forces challenging, struggling to visualize and apply them in different scenarios.

What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me. 
I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. 
I thought learning about uniform centripetal motion was really interesting. It was cool to learn how the different forces act on an object in centripetal motion.
 I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
 I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos. 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
 Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water
 The final example about the centripetal force and acceleration .
 Why free falling at terminal velocity is dangerous. 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
 I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
 The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
 I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
 I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
 I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications. 
 explanation of centripetal force
 what was most interesting was talking about the impact of falling out of a plane
 Non uniform motion and how acceleration isn't always towards the center was interesting even if it wasn't explained in-depth.
 The question of the hanging ball will experience centripetal force.
 Top hat 
 I really enjoyed the plane question. I was a bit confused but it made me think of problems differently.
 I didn't know you can't jump out of an airplane into water, video games have indeed been lying.
 How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force 
 the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
 That Mg has to equal the Fd 
 I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
 the free body diagrams 
 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.
 it was interesting to see acceleration jumping from plane into water
 I think centripetal force is really interesting. It's so cool how something can go around a loop and not fall out
 The jumping out of a plane problem was the most interesting
 The water question with acceleration changing suddenly 
 Centripetal force isn't actually a new force.
 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",74,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me.

SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of acceleration in relative motion, particularly with the dinosaur problem, where they were unsure about whether each dinosaur needed its own positive and negative direction or if one could be used for the whole system.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider focusing on the most common theme that emerged from the reflections, which is the struggle to understand the concept of acceleration in relative motion, particularly with the dinosaur problem. You could rephrase the summary to: ""Students struggled to grasp the concept of acceleration in relative motion, particularly with the dinosaur problem, where they were unsure about the direction and sign changes.""
2. Consider highlighting the most common areas of confusion, such as the sign changes and direction of acceleration, and the difficulty in determining which kinematic formula to use. This could help to provide a more focused summary that addresses the most common challenges students faced.
3. Avoid including phrases that are not directly related to the dinosaur question, such as ""calculus-based content and quadratic equations."" While these topics may be relevant to the overall lecture, they are not specifically related to the dinosaur question, and including them in the summary may make it less focused.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the concept of acceleration in relative motion, particularly with the dinosaur problem, where they were unsure about the direction and sign changes.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.

The monkey and bullet example and relative speed with horizontal initial velocities were common areas of struggle. Students also had difficulty keeping track of kinematics equations and their application.

Suggestions:

1. Emphasize the importance of understanding the context and perspective when applying relative motion, as this can help clarify when to add or subtract vectors.
2. Provide more explicit guidance on how to keep track of kinematics equations and their application in different scenarios, such as using a diagram or table to organize the equations.
3. Consider providing additional examples or practice problems that focus on relative motion with horizontal initial velocities to help students better understand this concept.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found relative motion challenging, particularly with vector addition and subtraction.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

1. **Focus on the most common areas of confusion**: While the summary mentions that students generally found the lecture clear, it would be more effective to focus on the specific areas where students struggled the most, such as the application of trigonometric functions, unit vectors, and vector subtraction. This would provide a more targeted summary that highlights the most common pain points for students.

Example: ""Students struggled with the application of trigonometric functions, particularly when to add or subtract vectors, and had difficulty with the concept of unit vectors and determining the direction of a resultant vector.""

2. **Use more concise language**: The summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise. This would make it easier to quickly scan and understand the main points.

Example: ""Students struggled with trigonometric function application, unit vectors, and vector subtraction. Visual aids and examples helped, but some students found it challenging to determine resultant vector direction.""

3. **Highlight the most important concepts**: The summary mentions that students appreciated the use of visual aids and examples, but it would be more effective to highlight the most important concepts that students need to understand, such as the difference between scalars and vectors, and how to add and subtract vectors.

Example: ""Students need to understand the difference between scalars and vectors, as well as how to add and subtract vectors, including when to add or subtract. Visual aids and examples helped illustrate these concepts.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the application of trigonometric functions, particularly when to add or subtract vectors, and had difficulty with the concept of unit vectors and determining the direction of a resultant vector."

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos.

 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.

 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!

 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough.

**Summary:** Students generally found the TopHat question to be a useful tool for assessing their understanding of vectors, but some struggled with the format and needed more practice to feel comfortable using it. Some students appreciated the immediate feedback and ability to ask questions, while others found it distracting or confusing.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Provide more guidance on the TopHat question format**: Some students felt overwhelmed by the TopHat question format and needed more guidance on how to approach it. Providing more explicit instructions or examples could help alleviate this confusion.
2. **Offer more practice opportunities**: Students who struggled with the TopHat question format would benefit from more practice opportunities to become comfortable with it. This could be achieved by providing additional TopHat questions or using a similar format in future lectures.

When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","Here is a summary of the focused topic ""Two Blocks/Forces/Systems"" based on the students' reflections:

SUMMARY: Students found it challenging to grasp the concept of friction on an incline and combining forces when dealing with multiple blocks. The top hat questions, particularly those involving two blocks, were confusing, with students struggling to understand the forces and free body diagrams. Some students also expressed confusion about the coefficient of friction and its unit-less nature.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on providing more examples of static friction problems and how to use the coefficient of friction in real-world scenarios. This could include more practice problems and step-by-step solutions to help students better understand the concept.
2. Emphasize the importance of creating equivalent problems and diagrams that are easier to solve, and provide guidance on how to approach complex problems.
3. Clarify the difference between kinetic and static friction, and provide more real-world examples to help students understand the concept better.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to comprehend the concept of friction on an incline and combining forces when dealing with multiple blocks, particularly in top hat questions involving two blocks. They found it challenging to understand forces and free body diagrams, and were confused about the coefficient of friction's unit-less nature and real-world applications. To improve understanding, it is recommended to provide more examples of static friction problems, clarify the difference between kinetic and static friction, and offer guidance on creating equivalent problems and diagrams, as well as approaching complex problems."

SUMMARY: Students found the last question, which involved two blocks with different masses and friction, to be the most confusing part of the lecture. Many students struggled to understand how to combine the two blocks into one system and how to apply the forces and friction correctly. Some students also found the concept of friction on an incline and the difference between static and kinetic friction to be challenging.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider combining the two main points of confusion: the combination of two blocks into one system and the application of forces and friction. This could be done by rephrasing the summary to focus on the challenges students faced in understanding how to integrate the two blocks and apply the forces and friction correctly.
2. Emphasize the specific aspects of the last question that caused confusion. For example, the summary could highlight the difficulty students had in understanding how to combine the two blocks, or the struggle to apply the forces and friction correctly. This would provide a more detailed and targeted summary.
3. Consider adding a sentence or two to provide context for the students' struggles. For example, the summary could mention that the last question was a complex problem that required students to apply multiple concepts learned in the lecture, or that it was a challenging problem that pushed students to think critically about the concepts. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' experiences and challenges.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the last question, which involved combining two blocks with different masses and friction, to be the most challenging part of the lecture.

 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.

 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g’s tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I wasconfused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variableswould end up cancelling.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Terminal Velocity:

Terminal velocity was a challenging concept for many students, with difficulties in setting up the equation and canceling out unknown variables. Students also struggled to apply the concept in different scenarios, particularly when transitioning from air to water.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit guidance on how to set up the equation for terminal velocity, including step-by-step instructions on how to cancel out unknown variables.
2. Offer additional examples and practice problems that demonstrate the application of terminal velocity in different scenarios, such as objects transitioning from air to water or vice versa.
3. Emphasize the importance of understanding the interaction between air and water densities in determining terminal velocity, and provide more explicit explanations on how these densities affect the equation.","Here is a refined summary of the students' reflections on the topic of Terminal Velocity:

REFINED SUMMARY: Students found terminal velocity challenging, particularly in setting up the equation and canceling out unknown variables. They struggled to apply the concept in scenarios like transitioning from air to water, and were unclear about the interaction between air and water densities. To improve understanding, explicit guidance on equation setup and step-by-step variable cancellation is needed, along with additional examples and practice problems demonstrating terminal velocity applications."

I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion. 
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.

 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.

Suggestions:

1. To make the summary more concise, consider combining similar ideas and eliminating repetitive phrases. For example, the sentence ""They appreciated the hands-on experience of creating and formatting histograms in Excel"" could be combined with ""They enjoyed learning about the different types of graphs and when to use them"" to create a single sentence that conveys the same information.
2. Consider focusing more on the specific Excel features and techniques that students found interesting, rather than general statements about the topic. For example, the summary could highlight the fact that students found the ability to edit bins and calculate bin sizes in Excel to be particularly useful and interesting.
3. To make the summary more engaging, consider adding a few specific quotes or anecdotes from students to illustrate their reactions to the topic. For example, the summary could include a quote from a student who found the histogram example to be particularly helpful or interesting, or a brief anecdote about a student's experience working in a breakout room.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found Excel's histogram feature to be engaging and practical, appreciating the hands-on experience of creating and formatting histograms, and learning about the different types of graphs and when to use them.

In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense! 
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.

SUMMARY: Students generally found Assignment 13 to be unclear, with many expressing confusion about the calculation of energy units, the process of creating graphs, and the criteria and constraints of the assignment. Some students would have liked more guidance on how to approach the project, and a few were unsure about what variables and process to use when making graphs.

Suggestions:

1. Provide more explicit instructions on how to calculate energy units and create graphs, including examples and visuals to aid understanding.
2. Clarify the criteria and constraints of the assignment, including what variables and processes to use when making graphs.
3. Offer additional guidance on how to approach the project, including tips on how to structure the assignment and what to include in the report.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found Assignment 13 unclear, with many expressing confusion about calculating energy units, creating graphs, and understanding criteria and constraints.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and straightforward, with most reporting that they did not find anything confusing. However, some students struggled with the application of payback periods and capital investment, and a few found the calculations for Assignment 13, particularly the environmental section, to be confusing.

Suggestions:

1. To improve the summary, consider combining the two main points into a single sentence, focusing on the topic of Assignment 13. For example: ""Students generally found the lecture clear and straightforward, but some struggled with the application of payback periods and capital investment in Assignment 13, particularly the environmental section.""
2. Consider removing the phrase ""with most reporting that they did not find anything confusing"" as it is not essential to the summary and makes it slightly wordy. Instead, focus on the specific points that students found confusing or struggled with.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing the phrase ""a few found"" and instead use a more specific number or percentage of students who found the calculations confusing. For example: ""Some students struggled with the calculations for Assignment 13, particularly the environmental section, with a few finding it confusing.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture clear and straightforward, but some struggled with the application of payback periods and capital investment in Assignment 13, particularly the environmental section, with a few students finding the calculations confusing."

There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

 The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
 when assignment 13 is due
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.

Many students mentioned discrepancies between the numbers presented in the slides, with some slides showing different values for CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline. Additionally, some students were unclear about the format and criteria for the in-class participation.

And here are 3 suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific issues with the PowerPoint slides, such as the discrepancies in CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline, rather than generalizing that the slides were ""confusing"". This would make the summary more concise and targeted.
2. Remove the phrase ""specifically regarding the calculation of carbon emissions"" as it's implied in the rest of the summary. This would make the summary more concise and focused.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and clear. For example, instead of saying ""many students mentioned discrepancies between the numbers presented in the slides"", you could say ""students noticed inconsistencies in the CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline across different slides"".","REFINED SUMMARY: PowerPoint slides for the in-class activity were problematic, with discrepancies in CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline across different slides.

2. Remove unnecessary information: The summary mentions that a few students were unclear about the criteria for in-class participation, but this is not directly related to the Midterm/Exam. Removing this information would make the summary more concise and focused.

3. Use more precise language: The summary uses phrases like ""many students found the in-class activity to be confusing"" and ""a few students were unclear"".

Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.

 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system.

SUMMARY: Students found Assignment 12 (A12) to be engaging and interesting, particularly the application of real-world engineering practices and the use of Excel to analyze data. Many students appreciated the time spent in breakout rooms to work on the project, which helped them understand the material better and collaborate with their teammates. The calculations of power and volumetric flow rate were also highlighted as interesting and relevant to the project.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider focusing more on the specific aspects of A12 that students found interesting, such as the calculations of power and volumetric flow rate, rather than generalizing that the assignment was ""engaging and interesting"". This would make the summary more specific and relevant to the topic.
2. Emphasize the importance of teamwork and collaboration in the breakout rooms, as many students highlighted this as a valuable aspect of the class. This could be phrased as ""Students appreciated the opportunity to work in breakout rooms, which allowed for effective collaboration and teamwork.""
3. Consider removing the phrase ""particularly the application of real-world engineering practices"" as it is not explicitly mentioned in the reflections. Instead, focus on the specific aspects of A12 that students found relevant and interesting, such as the use of Excel and the calculations of power and volumetric flow rate.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students appreciated the hands-on application of engineering concepts in Assignment 12, particularly the calculations of power and volumetric flow rate.

SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process to be the most interesting part of the lecture, as it allowed them to view a problem from various perspectives and understand the importance of considering different roles and stakeholders. They also appreciated the flexibility and freedom to design their own solutions, which made the project more engaging and relevant to their own experiences as students on campus.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary to focus more on the specific aspects of problem scoping that students found most interesting, such as the importance of considering different perspectives and stakeholders. This will help to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.

Example: SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process most interesting due to its emphasis on considering various perspectives and stakeholders, which helped them understand the complexity of the problem.

2. Remove the phrase ""as it allowed them to"" and instead use more direct language to convey the students' experiences. This will make the summary more engaging and easier to read.

Example: SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process most interesting because it allowed them to view a problem from various perspectives and understand the importance of considering different roles and stakeholders.

3. Consider adding more specific details from the reflections to support the summary. For example, you could mention that students appreciated the flexibility and freedom to design their own solutions, which made the project more engaging and relevant to their own experiences as students on campus. This will help to make the summary more concrete and supported by evidence from the reflections.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found the problem scoping process most interesting due to its emphasis on considering various perspectives and stakeholders, which helped them understand the complexity of the problem.

I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.

I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.

1. Consider focusing more specifically on the aspects of teamwork that students found most engaging, such as the hands-on experience of working together to solve problems or the opportunity to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. This could make the summary more concise and targeted.
2. Consider using more precise language to describe the teamwork experience, such as ""collaborative problem-solving"" or ""interdependent learning"" instead of ""hands-on experience of working together to solve problems"". This could make the summary more descriptive and nuanced.
3. Consider adding more detail about what students learned from their teamwork experience, such as ""appreciated the value of diversity in perspectives"" or ""realized the importance of effective communication in teamwork"".

It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

However, some students struggled to apply the approach, particularly in assignment A10, citing unclear instructions and difficulty understanding mathematical models. Additionally, students were unclear about the concepts of SSE, SST, and r^2 values, and would benefit from more in-depth explanations and examples."

The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of power calculation clear, with some minor areas of confusion. A few students struggled with converting units, understanding the pressure head calculation, and calculating total power. Some students also found the instructions for the exam and in-class activity unclear. Overall, students appreciated the clarity of the lecture and were able to follow along with the presentation.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more on the specific areas of confusion, such as unit conversion, pressure head calculation, and total power calculation, rather than simply stating that there were ""minor areas of confusion"". This would provide more concrete information for the instructor to address.
* Remove the phrase ""with some minor areas of confusion"" as it does not add much value to the summary and makes it seem like the students were generally confused, which is not the case.
* Consider adding more specific details about what students found unclear, such as the instructions for the exam and in-class activity, to provide more context for the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the topic of power calculation clear, with some struggling to convert units, understand the pressure head calculation, and calculate total power.

SUMMARY: Many students found the in-class assignment and project instructions unclear, citing confusion about specific tasks, requirements, and expectations. Some students struggled to understand the scope of the project, what was due, and how to complete certain parts of the assignment. There was also confusion about the problem statement, stakeholder involvement, and the need for clarification on certain terms and concepts.

Suggestions to improve the summary:

1. Focus on the most common points of confusion: While the summary mentions multiple areas of confusion, it could be condensed to focus on the most frequently mentioned points, such as the in-class assignment, project scope, and problem statement.
2. Use more concise language: The summary is already concise, but it could be further condensed to make it even more readable. This could be achieved by removing unnecessary words and phrases, such as ""citing confusion about"" and ""some students struggled to understand"".
3. Avoid repetition: The summary mentions ""confusion"" multiple times, which can make it seem repetitive. Instead, the summary could use more varied language to convey the same idea, such as ""unclear instructions"" or ""lacking clarity"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students experienced unclear instructions, particularly with the in-class assignment and project scope, leading to confusion about specific tasks, requirements, and expectations. Many struggled to understand the problem statement and stakeholder involvement, highlighting the need for clearer guidance on these aspects."

nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!

 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.

I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.

 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.

 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions

 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.

Summary: Students found in-class calculations and assignments challenging, particularly with formulas, variables, and mathematical models. They struggled with unclear instructions and felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the calculations.

Suggestions:

1. Provide clearer explanations and examples for formulas and mathematical models, especially for the laminar approach. This could include step-by-step instructions and visual aids to help students understand the calculations.
2. Offer more guidance on how to approach complex calculations, such as breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. This could help students feel less overwhelmed and more confident in their abilities.
3. Consider providing additional resources or support for students who are struggling with calculations, such as one-on-one tutoring or online resources. This could help students who are having difficulty understanding the material and provide them with the support they need to succeed.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found in-class calculations and assignments challenging, particularly with formulas, variables, and mathematical models.

 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms.

 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Gasoline Density clear and straightforward, with some minor confusion regarding the inclusion of density in the in-class activity. A few students were unsure about the relevance of density to the calculations, while others appreciated the explanation of environmental impacts and the emphasis on considering societal effects in engineering decisions.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the specific topic of Gasoline Density: While the original summary mentions the inclusion of density in the in-class activity, it could be more specific in highlighting the students' understanding of the concept of Gasoline Density itself. For example, the summary could mention whether students found the explanation of Gasoline Density clear or if they had any questions about its relevance to the calculations.
2. Highlight the range of opinions: The original summary mentions that some students were unsure about the relevance of density to the calculations, while others appreciated the explanation of environmental impacts. To make the summary more nuanced, it could highlight the range of opinions and reactions to the topic of Gasoline Density.
3. Avoid general statements: The original summary starts with ""Students generally found the lecture on Gasoline Density clear and straightforward"". This statement is too general and doesn't provide specific insight into the students' understanding of the topic. Instead, the summary could focus on specific quotes or reactions from students to provide a more accurate representation of their understanding.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students had varying reactions to the concept of Gasoline Density, with some finding it clear and relevant to the calculations, while others were unsure about its significance.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing

 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.

FOCUSED TOPIC: Seeing Climate Change
Original Summary: SUMMARY: Students were engaged by the discussion on climate change and its impact on the environment, particularly the calculation of carbon emissions from everyday activities such as driving. They found it interesting to learn about the trade-offs between design choices and their environmental effects, as well as the importance of considering carbon footprints in engineering projects. The hands-on activity of calculating their own car's carbon emissions and exploring the NASA website on climate change were highlights of the lecture, emphasizing the significance of addressing climate change as engineers.

Suggestions:

1. Consider condensing the summary by removing repetitive phrases and focusing on the most important points. For example, the phrase ""particularly the calculation of carbon emissions from everyday activities such as driving"" could be removed as it is implied by the phrase ""calculating their own car's carbon emissions"".
2. Emphasize the students' emotional response to the topic, such as their surprise or concern about the impact of their daily activities on the environment. This could be done by incorporating quotes or phrases that convey their emotional response, such as ""I found it interesting to learn about the trade-offs between design choices and their environmental effects"" or ""I would have never thought it was that much"".
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the students' newfound understanding or awareness of climate change, rather than just the activities they found interesting. For example, ""Students gained a deeper understanding of the importance of considering carbon footprints in engineering projects and the significant impact of their daily activities on the environment"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were engaged by the discussion on climate change and its impact on the environment, particularly the calculation of their own carbon emissions.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go throughthem and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for itto be clear.
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity

1. Consider combining the two main points about Assignment 8 (confusion regarding missing data and ""new data"" tab) into a single sentence to make the summary more concise.
2. Emphasize the specific areas where students struggled the most, such as understanding z-scores and their application to probability and data analysis, to provide a clearer picture of the main issues.
3. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more on the specific details that students found unclear or confusing, rather than simply stating that some students found it sufficient and others requested more information.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","Here is the summary:

SUMMARY: Students found the Skittles Example to be a bit confusing, particularly in regards to switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, and understanding how to calculate the area under the curve using calculus. Some students also struggled with the concept of z-scores and how they relate to the normal distribution.

Suggestions:

1. Consider rephrasing the summary to focus more specifically on the topic of the Skittles Example, rather than including general comments about the class or assignments. For example, the summary could start with ""Students struggled with the concept of switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in the Skittles Example..."".
2. Consider breaking the summary into two separate paragraphs, one for the x-axis issue and one for the z-score issue, to make it easier to follow and understand.
3. Consider adding more specific details from the students' reflections to the summary, such as the specific questions or concerns they had about the Skittles Example. This could help to make the summary more informative and useful for the instructor.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled with the concept of switching the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in the Skittles Example, and many were unclear about how to calculate the area under the curve using calculus.

Here is a summary of the students' reflections on the topic of trade-offs:

Students found the discussion on design trade-offs and the concept of trade-offs in general to be interesting and relevant to their understanding of engineering and its impact on the environment. They appreciated the introduction of real-world examples and the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions. Many students enjoyed the in-class activity where they calculated their own carbon footprint and were surprised by the amount of CO2 emissions their cars produce. The connection between trade-offs and environmental sustainability was a key takeaway for many students, as they realized the importance of considering the environmental impact of their designs and decisions.

And here are my suggestions to improve the summary:

Suggestions:

1. Focus more on the concept of trade-offs: While the summary mentions the discussion on design trade-offs, it could delve deeper into the concept of trade-offs and how it relates to engineering and environmental sustainability. For example, it could highlight the students' understanding of the trade-offs between environmental sustainability and other factors such as cost, efficiency, and feasibility.
2. Emphasize the practical application: The summary mentions the in-class activity where students calculated their own carbon footprint, but it could emphasize more on how this activity helped them understand the practical application of trade-offs in real-world scenarios. For example, it could highlight how the activity helped them realize the importance of considering the environmental impact of their designs and decisions.
3. Use more concise language: The summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise and focused on the main points. For example, it could combine similar ideas and eliminate unnecessary words to make it more readable.","REFINED SUMMARY:

Students found the concept of trade-offs to be a crucial aspect of engineering, as it requires balancing multiple factors to achieve a desired outcome. They appreciated the discussion on design trade-offs, which highlighted the importance of considering environmental sustainability alongside other factors such as cost, efficiency, and feasibility. The in-class activity, where students calculated their own carbon footprint, further emphasized the practical application of trade-offs in real-world scenarios. By understanding the trade-offs between environmental sustainability and other factors, students gained a deeper appreciation for the impact of their designs and decisions on the environment."

The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information

 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.

SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on Criteria and Constraints/Stakeholders to be clear and easy to follow, with most reporting no major confusion. However, some students struggled with understanding the distinction between criteria and constraints, and how to identify stakeholders.

Suggestions:

1. To further clarify the distinction between criteria and constraints, consider providing concrete examples or analogies to help students better understand the concepts.
2. To address the confusion regarding stakeholder identification, consider providing more guidance on how to approach this task, such as through a case study or group exercise.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources

This could help to identify areas where the instructor could provide more support and clarification.
3. To make the summary more concise, consider removing some of the redundant language and focusing on the most critical points.

Summary: Students generally found the lecture on gas density clear and easy to understand, with some minor confusion regarding the inclusion of density in the in-class activity and the calculation of carbon emissions.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the specific points of confusion: While the summary mentions that students found the lecture on gas density clear and easy to understand, it would be more effective to highlight the specific points of confusion, such as the inclusion of density in the in-class activity and the calculation of carbon emissions. This would provide a more accurate representation of the students' understanding of the topic.
2. Emphasize the importance of density in the context of gas: The summary could benefit from emphasizing the importance of density in the context of gas, particularly in relation to the in-class activity. This would help students understand the relevance of density in the calculation of carbon emissions and its impact on the environmental analysis.
3. Provide more context for the calculation of commercial energy price: The summary mentions that students found it challenging to understand how to calculate the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period. Providing more context or examples for this calculation could help clarify the concept and make it more accessible to students.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students generally found the lecture on gas density clear and easy to understand, with some minor confusion regarding the inclusion of density in the in-class activity and the calculation of carbon emissions. Specifically, students struggled to understand the relevance of density in the context of gas and its impact on environmental analysis. Additionally, some students found it challenging to calculate the commercial energy price with a 3-year payback period."

Something interesting was the quiz in class, I enjoyed it and think I did well. 
I liked learning about all the ways to create ideas in your head. 
It was interesting to finish the quiz and get it over with.
Nothing was that interesting in today's class. The topics discussed were neutral.
The breakout group time we had to work with out groups 
I enjoyed talking about differing approaches to finding solutions 
What I found most interesting about today's class was how much processing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be used to create a solution. 
I found the biomimicry of the snake to be very interesting.
Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
 I enjoyed the class it really is starting to seem like we are learning stuff that is going to be very important to us. I was also very excited to learn that A16 was not part 4 like we thought
 Learning about different types of problem solving
 I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
 I found the amount of types of ideas to generate very interesting because there is such a wide variety of things to think about.
 I thought the beetle video was interesting because it was happening at Purdue and the way nature adapted was cool.
 Using Google to find patents and how it is all public information. 
 I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
 Even though the use of biomimicry was a little confusing, I did find how it was used in the video to be incredibly interesting!
 I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class. 
 The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering. 
 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before. 
 It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
 The prompt for the quiz was interesting.

Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most prominent theme: While the original summary mentions both biomimicry and idea generation methods, the students' reflections seem to be more focused on biomimicry. Consider condensing the summary to focus solely on biomimicry, highlighting the specific examples and reactions that stood out to students.
2. Use more concise language: The original summary is a bit lengthy and could be condensed to make it more concise. Consider using shorter sentences and focusing on the most important points to convey the main ideas.
3. Use more specific quotes or examples: While the original summary mentions that students found certain examples ""particularly interesting"", consider incorporating specific quotes or examples from the students' reflections to make the summary more engaging and concrete. For example, ""Students were fascinated by the biomimicry of snake skin, which was described as 'very interesting' by several students.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students were captivated by the concept of biomimicry, finding it fascinating to learn about how humans are creating technology that mimics animals.

Suggestions:

* Consider combining similar ideas and phrases to create a more cohesive summary. For example, the phrases ""starting of the new design project"" and ""problem scoping"" could be combined into a single sentence.
* Focus on the most common themes and ideas that emerged from the student reflections, rather than trying to include every single point. This will help to create a more concise and focused summary.
* Consider using more active verbs to create a more engaging summary.

SUMMARY: Students found the concept of iterative tree traversal, particularly with the use of a stack, to be an interesting and intuitive approach. They appreciated the comparison between recursive and iterative methods, noting that iteration can be seen as mimicking a call stack. The discussion on converting recursive functions to iterative ones and the introduction of a new Abstract Data Type (ADT) were also well-received.

And here are 2-3 suggestions to improve the generated summary:

Suggestions:

* Consider focusing more specifically on the topic of iteration/iterative/iteratively, and avoid mentioning the comparison between recursive and iterative methods, which is not directly related to the topic. For example, the summary could start with ""Students found the concept of iterative tree traversal, particularly with the use of a stack, to be an interesting and intuitive approach.""
* Emphasize the key points that students found most interesting or important, such as the use of a stack, the conversion of recursive functions to iterative ones, and the introduction of a new ADT. This could help to make the summary more concise and focused.
* Consider rephrasing the summary to make it more concise and clear. For example, instead of saying ""the discussion on converting recursive functions to iterative ones and the introduction of a new Abstract Data Type (ADT) were also well-received"", the summary could simply say ""students appreciated the conversion of recursive functions to iterative ones and the introduction of a new ADT"".","REFINED SUMMARY: Students found iterative tree traversal, particularly with the use of a stack, to be an interesting and intuitive approach.

UDF in MATLAB","Suggestions:

1. Focus on the most common theme: The original summary covers a wide range of points, including both positive and negative reactions to UDFs. To make it more concise, focus on the most common theme that emerges from the reflections, such as the difficulty in understanding UDFs and the importance of hands-on practice. For example, the summary could focus on how students appreciated the in-class activity and practice questions, and how they found the lecture's in-depth instruction and group work helpful in clarifying their understanding.

2. Eliminate redundant phrases: The original summary includes phrases such as ""I found"" and ""I enjoyed"" multiple times. To make it more concise, eliminate these phrases and focus on the main points being made. For example, instead of saying ""I found learning about the practice questions very interesting,"" the summary could simply state ""Students appreciated the practice questions.""

3. Use more specific language: The original summary uses general terms like ""engaging"" and ""helpful"" to describe the lecture. To make it more specific, use language that reflects the actual content of the lecture, such as ""in-depth instruction on user-defined functions"" or ""hands-on studio time."" This will make the summary more informative and accurate.","REFINED SUMMARY: Students appreciated the hands-on approach to learning user-defined functions (UDFs), finding the in-class activity and practice questions helpful in clarifying their understanding.
