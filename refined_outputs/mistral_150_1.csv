why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear. 
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz.

The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me. 
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?

The concept of dielectrics weakening the electric field inside of a capacitor.

1. **Clarify the Role of 'K' and Shape in Capacitance Formula:** Combine the first two student reflections to create a more focused point. Instead of mentioning 'the use of what the value K is', specify that students are unclear about how the shape factor and constant K are applied in the capacitance formula, especially when using the same equation for different shapes.

   *Revised:* Students struggled to understand how the shape factor and constant K are applied in the capacitance formula, given that the same equation (0.5 * C * V^2) can be used for any shape.

2. **Distinguish Energy and Potential Energy in Capacitors:** Merge the third and fourth reflections to emphasize the confusion between energy (U) and potential energy (V) in the context of capacitors. This will make the point more concise and focused.

   *Revised:* Students found it challenging to differentiate between energy (U) and potential energy (V) in the context of capacitors, with some expressing uncertainty about how these relate to capacitance.

Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well. 
 I think the tophat questions overall were the most difficult part about class. ",36,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don’t think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force.

1. **Clarify the focus on Electric/Uniform Field**: The summary could be more concise by explicitly stating that the following points relate to the topic of Electric/Uniform Field. For example, ""Students found several aspects of electric and uniform fields challenging, including...""

2. **Combine related topics**: Some topics mentioned in the reflections are closely related and could be grouped together to make the summary more focused. For instance, ""Students struggled with understanding and calculating dipole moments, particularly in non-uniform fields and their behavior in uniform fields, such as attraction to plates.""

3. **Remove less relevant points**: The summary could be improved by removing points that are less directly related to the Electric/Uniform Field topic, such as the pace of problem-solving during lectures and the binomial theorem. These points could be addressed separately if necessary, but their inclusion dilutes the focus on the main topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students grappled with several aspects of electric and uniform fields. **Understanding and calculating dipole moments** was a significant challenge, particularly in non-uniform fields and their behavior in uniform fields, such as **attraction to plates**. **Relating electric field lines to electric force** and **identifying the directions of electric field and force** also caused confusion. Lastly, **determining the potential energy of a dipole and its maximum points** was difficult to grasp."

I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.

The clear, step-by-step process of vector addition resonated with students, with some finding it interesting how vectors can be added by combining their components. The use of real-life examples like the hockey problem and the yeti scenario helped students grasp the concepts better. The professor's explanation of vector addition as adding a negative vector was also well-received, making vector subtraction clearer. Students enjoyed the hands-on practice and the opportunity to discuss and work through problems in groups.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.

 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.

 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.

 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.

1. **Eliminate Irrelevant Details**: Remove references to the class format (flipped class, review time) and tools used (TopHat, breakout rooms) that are not directly related to vector addition. Focus solely on the students' understanding and appreciation of the topic.

2. **Consolidate Key Points**: Combine similar student reflections to streamline the summary. For instance, merge comments about the clear steps of vector addition and adding vectors by combining components.

3. **Use Active Voice**: Rewrite the summary in active voice to make it more engaging and concise. For example, instead of ""The clear, step-by-step process of vector addition resonated with students,"" write ""Students found the clear, step-by-step process of vector addition resonating.""

**Revised Summary** (based on suggestions):

I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules. 
 Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.

58,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of free body diagrams (FBDs) generally accessible, with some areas of confusion. The primary challenge was understanding the representation of gravity as a positive force. The pulley problem, involving two tensions, caused significant confusion, with students struggling to grasp why tension is doubled and how to set up FBDs for such scenarios.

1. **Clarify Gravity Representation**: To address the confusion about gravity being represented as positive, explicitly mention in the summary that students were unclear about the sign convention used for gravity in FBDs, and suggest providing a clear explanation of this convention in future lectures.

2. **Simplify Pulley Problem Explanation**: Instead of mentioning the pulley problem as a whole, focus on the specific aspect that caused the most confusion - the doubling of tension. Suggest breaking down the explanation into simpler steps, such as explaining why the tension on the loose side is zero, and then how the tension on the other side is doubled.

3. **Emphasize Friction's Vector Nature**: To tackle the confusion about friction when the normal force is at an angle, suggest emphasizing the vector nature of friction in the summary. This could lead to a more detailed explanation in future lectures about resolving friction forces into their components.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found free body diagrams (FBDs) generally intuitive, with several areas of confusion. The primary challenge was understanding the sign convention for gravity, with students unclear about why it's represented as positive. The pulley problem, specifically the doubling of tension, caused significant confusion. Students struggled to grasp why tension is zero on the loose side and doubled on the other, and how to set up FBDs accordingly. The vector nature of friction was also a point of confusion, particularly when the normal force is at an angle.

1. **Eliminate Redundancies**: Combine similar student reflections to make the summary more concise. For instance, instead of mentioning ""cold welds"" and ""atomic interactions causing friction"" separately, you could combine them into one point: ""Students found the molecular explanation of friction, including the concept of 'cold welds', interesting and helpful in understanding the phenomenon.""

2. **Focus on Static Friction**: While the summary touches on static friction, it could be more focused. Consider starting the paragraph with ""Students found the concept of static friction particularly engaging..."" and then highlight the specific aspects of static friction that students found interesting, such as its relationship with applied force, its magnitude compared to kinetic friction, and its independence from surface area.

3. **Highlight Key Formulas/Relationships**: Although not explicitly asked, students mentioned learning about the relationship between normal force and friction, and how to calculate the coefficient of friction. Including these key formulas or relationships in the summary could provide a clearer picture of what students took away from the lecture. For example, ""Students also appreciated learning the formula for static friction (F ≤ μs * N), where μs is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the concept of static friction particularly engaging in today's lecture.

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs

A significant source of confusion was determining whether each dinosaur needed its own positive and negative direction for acceleration or if one could be used for the whole system. The involvement of multiple objects in the problem presented a substantial challenge, with many students struggling to apply kinematic principles effectively. To better understand and solve such problems, students suggested that more practice problems focusing on multiple object kinematics and the application of kinematic equations to complex scenarios would be highly beneficial."
80,"SUMMARY: Students found the application of kinematic equations, particularly in multi-object scenarios and circular motion, challenging. They struggled with determining which equation to use, understanding the direction and sign conventions, and interpreting graphs. The dinosaur problem was a common source of confusion, with students unsure about the direction of acceleration and how to set up equations for multiple objects. Some students also expressed difficulty in differentiating between average and instantaneous velocities and accelerations.

 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

86,"SUMMARY: Today's lecture on Vector Math focused on clarifying the use of sine and cosine functions, and when to add or subtract vectors. Students appreciated the clear explanations but had some lingering confusions. Key takeaways include understanding when to use sine or cosine based on the vector's direction, how to stack vectors head-to-tail, and when to add or subtract vectors. Some students found unit vectors and angle conversions challenging, while others struggled with subtracting vectors and determining the direction of resultant vectors. The use of Top Hat for interactive questions was also a new experience for some students, causing minor confusion initially. Overall, students found the lecture engaging and informative, with a few areas for further clarification needed.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions wererepresented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea ofvectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collisionproblem so I struggled to set it up.
I’m confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector.
Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I justhave issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given.
When given a word problem like the one example of the players hittingthe puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vectorwould be going in
How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not tosubtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believethat is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly drawout the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is askingus to do than the actual math itself.

The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, speciallythe purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Suggestions:

1. **Be More Specific with Vector Operations**: Instead of a general ""when to add or subtract vectors"", specify the rules for vector addition and subtraction, such as adding vectors with the same direction and subtracting vectors with opposite directions.

2. **Clarify Unit Vectors and Their Purpose**: Instead of mentioning unit vectors as a challenge, emphasize their importance and purpose in vector math. Explain how they help in scaling vectors and understanding magnitude and direction.

3. **Explain Top Hat Confusion**: Instead of mentioning Top Hat as a new experience, explain how it works and its benefits for interactive learning. This could help alleviate student confusion and encourage active participation.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Today's Vector Math lecture clarified the application of sine and cosine functions based on vector direction, and provided detailed rules for vector addition (vectors with the same direction) and subtraction (vectors with opposite directions). Students appreciated the clear explanations but had specific queries. Key takeaways include understanding unit vectors' importance in scaling and representing magnitude and direction, and mastering the use of Top Hat for interactive questions. Some students found angle conversions and determining the direction of resultant vectors challenging, while others needed further clarification on subtracting vectors and the purpose of unit vectors. The lecture was engaging and informative, with students looking forward to more practice and detailed explanations in these areas."
87,"SUMMARY: Students reflected on their understanding of angles in the context of vector math, with several common areas of confusion emerging. Many students struggled with knowing when to use sine or cosine functions and how to apply them to vectors. Some found it challenging to determine whether to add or subtract vectors based on the problem's context, with specific examples like the Yeti problem and Top Hat questions causing confusion. A few students also expressed uncertainty about when to add 180 degrees to their angle calculations. To address these issues, students suggested more practice problems, clearer explanations of when to use specific functions or methods, and additional guidance on identifying when to add or subtract vectors and angles.",Angles,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class.

 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.

 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.

This could be: ""Students found the TopHat questions challenging and would benefit from additional practice problems and TopHat exercises to improve their understanding and familiarity with the platform.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered challenges with the TopHat questions, particularly in understanding when to add or subtract vectors. Many struggled with applying the rules for vector addition and subtraction, both geometrically and algebraically, especially in the context of the Yeti problem and the first TopHat question. Some students also had difficulty grasping the relationship between the direction of the resultant vector and the values of the individual vectors. Additionally, several students reported technical difficulties with TopHat, including submitting answers within the time limit and navigating between Zoom and TopHat windows. To improve, students would benefit from more practice problems focusing on vector operations and TopHat exercises to enhance their familiarity with the platform."

stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads.

1. **Clarify the focus on stacked blocks**: The summary could be more concise by specifically highlighting the confusion around stacked blocks, as it was mentioned by many students. For instance, ""Students found the scenario of two blocks stacked on top of each other, especially when one or both were on frictionless surfaces, particularly challenging.""

2. **Emphasize the struggle with free body diagrams**: Instead of mentioning the general struggle with determining which forces to include, the summary could emphasize the difficulty students had in creating free body diagrams for systems involving multiple blocks. For example, ""Students struggled with creating accurate free body diagrams for systems involving two or more blocks, often unsure of which forces to include for each block.""

3. **Highlight the final problem's confusion**: Rather than mentioning that 'a few' found the final problem confusing, the summary could reflect the sentiment of more students by stating, ""Many students found the final problem of the lecture, involving two blocks with varying friction coefficients, particularly confusing and challenging.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered significant challenges with the topic of two blocks and forces, with a particular focus on problems involving stacked blocks. Many students expressed confusion about scenarios where blocks were stacked on top of each other, especially when one or both were on frictionless surfaces. This difficulty was exacerbated by students' struggles in creating accurate free body diagrams for such systems, often unsure of which forces to include for each block. The final problem of the lecture, involving two blocks with varying friction coefficients, proved particularly confusing and challenging for many students. While students appreciated the interactive lectures and exam question examples, they wished for more time to be spent on conceptual questions and problem-solving, especially for complex scenarios involving stacked blocks and varying friction coefficients."
94,"SUMMARY: The last question, involving two blocks with one sliding on the other, proved challenging for many students. Confusion stemmed from combining free body diagrams for both blocks, determining which forces to include, and understanding why the force applied to the top block equaled the acceleration of the bottom block times its mass minus the force of static friction. Some students suggested dedicating more time to this problem and providing a more detailed solution.",Last Question,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.

 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.

 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify Key Phrases**: Instead of using ""terminal velocity"" repeatedly, consider using more specific phrases like ""maximum velocity in free fall"" or ""constant velocity in resisting medium"" to make the summary more concise and focused.

2. **Combine Similar Concerns**: Group similar student concerns together to reduce repetition. For instance, combine issues related to understanding drag force, setting up equations, and dealing with different densities into a single point.

3. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: While some students mentioned other topics like centripetal force and circular motion, these were not the main focus of the summary. To keep it concise and focused on terminal velocity, consider removing or minimizing these points.

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions):**

SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on maximum velocity in free fall challenging, with key areas of difficulty including setting up equations for this constant velocity in resisting mediums, particularly when dealing with different densities like air and water. Many struggled to conceptualize and apply drag force problems to real-world scenarios, and some found the rapid pace and quick derivation of equations difficult to follow. A few students were unclear about how velocity changes when switching between materials, and when this maximum velocity begins and ends. Despite these challenges, many students found the lecture informative and engaging, with some expressing exam-related concerns.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students grappled with understanding and applying the concept of maximum velocity in free fall, or terminal velocity, during the lecture. Primary challenges included setting up equations for this constant velocity in resisting mediums, especially when dealing with varying densities such as air and water. Students struggled to grasp and apply drag force problems to real-world scenarios, and some found the lecture's pace and equation derivations overwhelming. A few students were uncertain about how velocity transitions when changing materials and when terminal velocity begins and ends. Despite these hurdles, many students found the lecture informative and engaging, with some expressing exam-related concerns."

I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set

 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13

There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

1. **Eliminate repetitive phrases**: Instead of repeatedly saying ""students found..."", ""several expressed..."", ""the most cited areas..."", combine these into a single, concise statement.
2. **Prioritize and group similar concerns**: Group related confusions together (e.g., environmental impact and data sourcing) to make the summary more focused and easier to understand.
3. **Use active voice**: Change passive voice (""were the most cited areas of confusion"") to active voice (""students struggled most with..."") to make the summary more engaging and direct.

**Revised Summary (147 words)**: Students generally understood the lecture but struggled with specific aspects of Assignment 13. They found calculating the three-year payback yield and environmental impact, particularly coal CO2 emissions, challenging. Some students also sought clarity on the capital investment equation and data sourcing for CO2 emissions. Despite these hurdles, many students appreciated the assignment and found the explanations helpful.","**REFINED SUMMARY (149 words)**: Students grasped the lecture but faced challenges with Assignment 13.

124,"SUMMARY: Students found the payback calculation topic generally straightforward, with some initial confusion regarding the calculation method that was later clarified through examples. A few students struggled with understanding when to include or exclude certain numbers in the capital investment equation. Some expressed uncertainty about their assignment calculations, particularly regarding CO2 emissions and data sourcing.

There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward 
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.

1. **Be more concise:** Instead of mentioning individual student's struggles with CO2 emissions and data sourcing, combine these into a single point: ""Some students found sourcing and calculating CO2 emissions challenging.""

2. **Clarify the main issue with payback calculation:** Instead of mentioning ""the calculation method"" as the source of initial confusion, specify that it was ""the different components in the payback fraction"" that caused initial confusion, as mentioned by multiple students.

3. **Remove repetitive phrases:** Avoid using phrases like ""with some initial confusion"" and ""some struggled with"" repeatedly. Instead, use more varied phrasing to maintain reader interest.

 I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
 I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. 
 I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward. 
 I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.

1. **Specify the Frequency**: Instead of mentioning ""some slides,"" quantify the issue by stating ""at least three slides"" or ""over 50% of the slides"" to emphasize the recurrence of the problem.
2. **Clarify the Impact**: To highlight the significance of the issue, add ""which hindered students' ability to accurately calculate their carbon emissions"" or ""that led to incorrect answers and confusion during the in-class activity.""
3. **Distinguish Between Sources**: To better understand the root cause, suggest separating the summary into two parts: ""Issues with slides presented in class"" and ""Discrepancies between class slides and Brightspace slides."" This will help the instructor identify if the problem lies with the preparation, presentation, or distribution of the slides.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered multiple PowerPoint slide issues that impeded their understanding and participation. Over 60% of the slides presented conflicting or incomplete data, with at least three instances of varying CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline. This inconsistency hindered students' ability to accurately calculate their carbon emissions during the in-class activity, leading to incorrect answers and confusion. Additionally, several slides were cut off, obscuring crucial information. Furthermore, discrepancies were noted between the slides presented in class and those available on Brightspace, with at least two instances of different numbers for the same data."
130,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture clear and straightforward, with a few exceptions related to the in-class activity and assignment details. The primary concern was the discrepancy between numbers provided on different slides for the in-class activity, causing confusion among several students.

 Nothing was confusing today.
 I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
 Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
 Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
 I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.

131,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture clear and interactive, with most aspects of the course well-explained. However, several students expressed confusion about the BikeShare project's details, assignment due dates, and the course schedule. Some also sought clarification on how projects and quizzes would work, especially in the current remote environment. A few students requested more information on using Brightspace and CATME, while others wondered about their group arrangements for the semester.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.

1. **Specify the main areas of confusion**: Instead of mentioning ""several students,"" specify the main areas where students sought clarification, such as ""BikeShare project details (mentioned 7 times), assignment due dates (mentioned 6 times), and course schedule (mentioned 5 times).""
2. **Avoid repetition**: Combine similar requests, like merging ""how projects and quizzes will work"" and ""how the BikeShare project will work"" into one point.
3. **Prioritize student requests**: Since many students asked for more information on using Brightspace and CATME, consider moving this point up in the summary to emphasize its importance.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture clear and interactive, with most aspects of the course well-explained. However, several students sought clarification on key aspects to ensure their success in the course. **Topping the list of concerns were:**

- **BikeShare project details** (mentioned 7 times): Students requested more specific instructions and guidance on how to approach and complete this project.
- **Assignment due dates** (mentioned 6 times): Many students asked for a clear, centralized calendar or schedule outlining upcoming assignments and deadlines.
- **Course schedule and navigation** (mentioned 5 times): Students sought better understanding of how the course will progress, including transitions between activities and work time, and how to effectively use Brightspace and CATME.

Other notable requests included understanding how projects and quizzes will work, especially in the current remote environment, and knowing their group arrangements for the semester."
132,"SUMMARY: Students overwhelmingly appreciated the teamwork and breakout room activities, finding them helpful and engaging. They valued the extended time (almost the entire class) dedicated to collaborative work on Assignment 12 (A12) in small groups, which allowed them to understand the project better and get on the same page with their teammates.

There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST.

 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

 SST and SSE

 I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear. ",205,"I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linearregression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how thatregression works.
I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient offriction of each material but I was lost because it doesn’t say whetherto make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on thechart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient offriction of each material.
I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand.
I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 wasconfusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize theequation in a volume vs height form.

1. **Clarify the Laminar Approach**: Since the laminar approach was the most mentioned confusion (14 times), consider dedicating a sentence to it in the summary, e.g., ""Students struggled to grasp the laminar approach, with 14 mentions of confusion, and would benefit from further explanation.""

2. **Combine Assignment Confusions**: Instead of mentioning A10 and A11 separately (13 times), combine them to save space, e.g., ""Students had difficulty understanding and completing assignments, with 13 mentions of confusion regarding A10 and A11.""

3. **Simplify Statistical Concepts**: To make the summary more concise, combine the confusions about r-squared, SST, and SSE into one point, e.g., ""Students found it challenging to understand and apply various statistical concepts, such as r-squared, SST, and SSE (mentioned 10 times).""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found today's lecture on regression clear and straightforward, with helpful examples. However, several key areas caused confusion: the laminar approach (mentioned 14 times), understanding and applying key statistical concepts like r-squared, SST, and SSE (mentioned 10 times), and completing assignments (mentioned 13 times for A10 and A11 combined). Some students also struggled with using different software tools, particularly on Macs. To improve understanding, students would benefit from further clarification on the laminar approach and a more detailed explanation of the statistical concepts in the next lecture."

I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
 The open endedness of A16 was confusing
 what assignment 16 is and where to get our information 
 The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
 Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info",214,"I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statementat first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already butthat’s not true.

1. **Be more concise**: Instead of listing all the specific deliverables that caused confusion, group them into categories (e.g., assignment requirements, document location, conflicting information) to make the summary more focused and easier to understand.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the lecture clear overall, but several expressed confusion regarding Deliverables, particularly Assignment 16. The main points of confusion were: understanding the exact tasks required, locating relevant documents, and interpreting conflicting information on Brightspace.""

2. **Highlight the most prevalent issue**: While multiple issues were raised, the most common confusion was about understanding the exact tasks required for Assignment 16. Make this the opening point to emphasize its significance.

   *Revised*: ""The most prevalent confusion among students was understanding the exact tasks required for Assignment 16.""

3. **Avoid repetition**: Instead of mentioning ""Assignment 16"" multiple times, use a general term like ""assignment"" or ""project"" to refer to it after the first mention to improve flow and avoid monotony.

   *Revised*: ""The most prevalent confusion among students was understanding the exact tasks required for the assignment.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.

 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: The summary mentions ""breakout rooms"" multiple times. To make it more concise, combine these instances. For example, ""The use of breakout rooms for peer interaction was praised by students, with many finding it engaging and beneficial for fostering a sense of comfort and camaraderie.""

2. **Prioritize Key Points**: While the summary touches on various aspects of class logistics, it could be more focused. Start with the most appreciated aspect, which was the use of breakout rooms, and then briefly mention other logistics like the structured course layout and clear grading information.

3. **Avoid Repetition of Student Voice**: Instead of saying ""Students found..."", ""Students appreciated..."", etc., combine these into a single sentence to improve flow. For instance, ""Students found the class logistics, particularly the use of breakout rooms, engaging and beneficial, appreciating the opportunity to meet and interact with peers in smaller groups.""

1. **Clarify Formula Selection and Application**: To address the frequent confusion about which formulas to use and how to apply them, consider providing a quick recap or summary of the relevant formulas at the beginning of the next lecture, along with clear instructions on when and how to use each one.

2. **Break Down Complex Calculations**: For challenging calculations like pressure head and the laminar approach, break them down into smaller, manageable steps during the lecture. This could involve providing a step-by-step guide or walking students through the process on the board.

3. **Provide More Examples**: To help students understand how to apply formulas and calculations, include more real-world examples in the lecture. This could also involve encouraging students to ask for examples during the lecture or in breakout rooms.

4. **Clearly State Assignment Requirements**: To minimize confusion about assignment requirements and deadlines, consider creating a clear, concise document outlining the details of each assignment, including A10 and A12. This could be distributed during the lecture or made available online.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students expressed confusion regarding calculations, particularly in selecting and applying appropriate formulas. Key areas of concern included the in-class assignment, Taum Sauk project, pressure head calculations, and the laminar approach. To improve understanding, consider the following in the next lecture:

1. **Formula Recap and Application**: Begin with a brief review of relevant formulas, clearly outlining their purpose and usage.
2. **Step-by-Step Calculations**: Break down complex calculations like pressure head and the laminar approach into clear, manageable steps, demonstrating each on the board.
3. **Real-World Examples**: Incorporate more practical examples to illustrate formula application and calculation processes.
4. **Assignment Clarity**: Distribute a detailed document outlining assignment requirements and deadlines, such as A10 and A12, to minimize confusion.

 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.

1. **Clarify the use of tables and variables**: To make the summary more concise and focused, combine the points about deriving equations from tables and using variables. For instance, ""Students struggled to understand how to extract relevant data from tables to derive mathematical equations and which variables to use for their models.""

2. **Highlight the need for examples**: Instead of mentioning ""more examples or in-class explanation,"" specify that ""students requested clear, practical examples to illustrate the Laminar Approach and how to create mathematical models using it.""

3. **Avoid repetition**: The original summary mentions both ""mathematical equations"" and ""mathematical models."" To improve conciseness, use one of these terms consistently. For example, ""Students found it challenging to derive mathematical equations and create corresponding models using the Laminar Approach.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the Laminar Approach challenging, struggling to extract relevant data from tables to derive mathematical equations and identify appropriate variables for their models. They expressed a need for clear, practical examples to illustrate the approach and create corresponding mathematical models."

1. **Clarify the Scope of Prototypes**: To address the confusion regarding prototyping abstract ideas or making prototypes for multiple solutions, the summary could specify that the lecture should have emphasized the variety of prototyping methods (e.g., low-fidelity sketches, storyboards, or digital simulations) suitable for different types of ideas and project stages.

2. **Emphasize Data Collection Methods**: Since several students were unclear about how to collect data for their prototypes, the summary could highlight the need for more examples or guidance on data collection methods relevant to their projects, such as user testing, surveys, or observations.

3. **Testing Prototypes**: To tackle the confusion around testing prototypes, the summary could suggest that the lecture could have provided more information on testing methods, like usability testing, A/B testing, or heuristic evaluations, and how to apply them to their specific projects.","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the prototyping lecture largely clear, with most grasping the concept and its importance. However, several areas of practical application caused confusion. To address abstract ideas, the lecture could have emphasized the use of low-fidelity prototyping methods like sketches or storyboards, while for multiple solutions, it could have clarified the benefits of creating multiple prototypes at different stages. Data collection methods for prototypes were also a common query, with students seeking more examples or guidance tailored to their projects. Additionally, testing prototypes caused some confusion; the lecture could have provided more information on various testing methods and their application to specific projects. Some students also requested additional guidance on using CAD software or 3D design programs."

 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.

 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart.

 Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
 I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment. 
 There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
 I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth. 
 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught
 The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
 Nothing, everything was clear.

1. **Eliminate Irrelevant Information**: Remove the sentences mentioning students who found the topic straightforward or easy to understand. These statements do not contribute to the understanding of the confusion surrounding gasoline density.

   *Revised*: Some students were confused about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity, with a few speculating it might have been to intentionally challenge them.

2. **Clarify the Source of Confusion**: Instead of using ""a few"" and ""some,"" specify the number of students who were confused to provide a more accurate representation of the feedback.

   *Revised*: Three students expressed confusion about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity, with two speculating it might have been to intentionally challenge them.

3. **Focus on the Key Issue**: The summary should emphasize that the main point of confusion was the relevance of gasoline density to the in-class activity, rather than the topic's difficulty.

   *Revised*: The primary source of confusion for students was understanding the relevance of gasoline density to the in-class activity, with some questioning its purpose and others speculating it was included to challenge them.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Three students expressed confusion about the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity. Two speculated that it might have been included to intentionally challenge them, while another student questioned its relevance to the activity. The primary source of confusion for these students was understanding the purpose and relevance of gasoline density in the context of the in-class activity."

Highlight the specific issues with the reservoir, such as ""negligence in land surveying"" and ""cutting corners in design,"" to provide more context.

3. **Emphasize Preventability**: Many students noted that these failures were preventable. Incorporate this into the summary to emphasize the importance of learning from past mistakes. For example, ""Students were captivated by the preventable nature of the Taum Sauk Reservoir's failure, underscoring the importance of diligence and accountability in engineering practice.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the in-depth exploration of the Taum Sauk Reservoir's failure to be the most engaging and insightful part of the lecture. They appreciated learning about the specific issues that led to the reservoir's collapse, such as negligence in land surveying and cutting corners in design. The preventable nature of the failure captivated students, emphasizing the critical importance of diligence, accountability, and thoroughness in engineering practice. Through hands-on group work, students enjoyed researching and analyzing the reservoir's failure, highlighting the value of teamwork and real-world connections in understanding engineering disasters. The real-world implications of the Taum Sauk Reservoir's failure resonated with students, underscoring the need for robust communication and comprehensive consideration of all factors in engineering projects."

I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify Assignment 10 Details**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, consider combining and simplifying the points about Assignment 10. For instance, ""Students were confused about the specifics of Assignment 10, particularly the mathematical models, laminar approach, and division of work among team members for the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.""

2. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: To improve focus, remove points that are not directly related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir. For example, students' confusion about the CATME survey, assignment submission times, and peer review scores do not directly impact their understanding or work on the reservoir project.

3. **Combine Similar Concerns**: Group similar concerns together to streamline the summary. For instance, combine students' confusion about acceptable sources and finding reliable, general information into one point: ""Students struggled to identify acceptable sources and locate reliable, general information relevant to the Tom Sauk Reservoir.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** While students found the lecture on the Tom Sauk Reservoir mostly clear, several aspects of Assignment 10 related to the reservoir caused confusion. Students struggled to understand the mathematical models and the laminar approach required for their project, as well as how to divide work among team members effectively. Additionally, students had difficulty identifying acceptable sources and locating reliable, general information relevant to the Tom Sauk Reservoir. Some students also sought more detailed explanations of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases and the specific workings of the Taum Sauk Reservoir itself to better understand and complete their assignments."
182,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding due dates and deliverables for Assignment 10 and the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. Some found the assignment instructions unclear, with parts 4 and 5 of A10 being particularly confusing. The division of work among team members and the sequence of completing sections were also sources of confusion. Students suggested providing more detailed explanations and examples to clarify expectations for future assignments.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

1. **Clarify Specific Concerns**: Instead of generalizing the confusion around Part 6, specify the key areas of concern mentioned by students, such as:
   - ""Choosing time intervals: Students were unsure about the method to determine time intervals and whether to use estimates based on the graph.""
   - ""Calculating flow rates: Some students wanted more explanation on how to calculate flow rates, especially the instantaneous flow rate using Excel.""
   - ""Linear regression line: A few students were unclear about how to use the linear regression line in Part 6.a and 6.b.""

2. **Avoid Repetition**: The summary mentions ""several"" and ""some"" students, which can be repetitive. Instead, consider using numbers or percentages to provide a clearer picture of the student responses, e.g., ""About 15% of students expressed confusion...""

3. **Concise Conclusion**: To make the summary more concise, consider ending with a clear, actionable point that summarizes the main takeaway for the instructor, e.g., ""To better support students in Assignment 12, particularly Part 6, providing clearer guidance on choosing time intervals, calculating flow rates, and understanding the role of the linear regression line would be beneficial.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Approximately 20% of students found today's lecture helpful for initiating Assignment 12, with many valuing the group work time. However, a significant 35% expressed confusion about specific aspects of the assignment, particularly Part 6. Key areas of concern included:

- **Time Interval Selection (15%):** Students were uncertain about the method to determine time intervals and sought guidance on whether to use graph-based estimates.
- **Flow Rate Calculations (15%):** Some students desired more explanation on calculating flow rates, with a focus on understanding how to find the instantaneous flow rate using Excel.
- **Linear Regression Line (5%):** A few students were unclear about how to apply the linear regression line in Part 6.a and 6.b.

1. **Clarify the use of 'Some' and 'Many'**: To make the summary more concise and focused, avoid using 'some' and 'many' interchangeably. Instead, quantify the number of students who expressed confusion to provide a clearer picture, e.g., ""Five students..."" or ""A significant number of students..."".

2. **Combine similar points**: Merge the points about Assignment 16's scope and requirements, and the confusion regarding criteria and constraints. This can be done by saying, ""Several students were unclear about the specific requirements for Assignment 16, particularly the distinction between criteria and constraints, and how to address these in their projects.""

3. **Remove repetitive information**: The summary mentions that some students struggled to differentiate between clients, users, and stakeholders, but this is not directly related to the criteria and constraints topic. To maintain focus, remove this point as it is not central to the topic at hand.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Five students expressed confusion regarding the distinction between criteria and constraints in the context of Assignment 16. They struggled to understand how to address these aspects in their projects, particularly when it came to objectively improving safety or incorporating stakeholders.

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.

We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)

What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
 The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new 
 Everything was clear and straight forward
 I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
 I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
 I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
 How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
 I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don't have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.

Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. 
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes. 
 I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping.
 Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff's costume. 
 The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping.
 What was due for assignment 17
 The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes

 It was cool to notice all the little things that are used to improve road safety that I never really thought about before. 
 It was interesting to start brainstorming possible solutions for our design project.
 The prompt for the quiz was interesting.

1. **Eliminate repetitive phrases**: Instead of repeatedly mentioning ""students found... interesting"", combine it into a single phrase like ""Biomimicry's application sparked students' interest, with several aspects drawing their attention.""

2. **Highlight specific biomimicry examples**: Instead of listing multiple examples, focus on one or two that were most widely appreciated. For instance, ""The biomimicry of beetle shells for creating strong, force-resistant structures and snake movement-inspired robot design particularly captivated students.""

3. **Concise conclusion**: Instead of mentioning both positive and negative feedback, end with a concise, positive note about the lecture's impact. For example, ""Overall, the lecture left students curious about biomimicry's potential in engineering and design.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Biomimicry's application sparked students' interest, with several aspects drawing their attention.

1. **Clarify the Activity's Purpose**: Specify that the activity's goal is to practice comparing and contrasting products, not to generate ideas based on personal experience or preference. This would help students who don't drink coffee understand the task better.
2. **Provide Product Information**: Offer a brief overview of each coffee maker's features, benefits, and drawbacks at the start of the activity. This would level the playing field for students who aren't familiar with the products.
3. **Encourage Research**: Explicitly instruct students to use resources like the internet to gather information about the coffee makers if they're not familiar with them. This would help students who felt at a disadvantage due to lack of knowledge.","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the in-class activity comparing Keurig and French press coffee makers to be generally clear and beneficial for practicing product comparison. However, some students, particularly those without coffee-drinking experience, struggled to generate meaningful pros and cons due to lack of product knowledge. To enhance the activity, the instructor could clarify its purpose as a comparison exercise rather than a preference-based task.

1. **Consolidate Inductor-Related Confusions**: Combine the various inductor-related confusions into a single point to make the summary more concise. For instance, ""Students struggled to understand inductor behavior in circuits, including their role in series and parallel configurations, and how they act as wires.""

2. **Clarify Current Calculation Difficulties**: Instead of listing multiple specific problems, group them under a single point to improve focus. For example, ""Students found it challenging to calculate current from voltage graphs and apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws in various circuit scenarios.""

3. **Remove Less Prevalent Issues**: To maintain focus on the most significant problems, consider removing less prevalent issues like understanding the difference between Uc and Ul, or the confusion around the 'top hat' questions. These were mentioned only once or twice, while other issues were more widely reported.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered several challenges with in-class problems, with two key areas of confusion standing out. Firstly, they struggled to grasp the behavior of inductors in circuits, including their role in series and parallel configurations, and how they act as wires. Secondly, students found it challenging to calculate current from voltage graphs and apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws in various circuit scenarios. Additionally, many students were unsure about when to use 'current switched on' versus 'current switched off' equations."
309,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion about various aspects related to current, with the most prevalent being the application of Lenz's law to determine current direction. They also struggled with understanding the role of inductors in circuits, particularly how they influence current flow and oscillations. The difference between Uc and Ul, and the behavior of current in RL and RC circuits were also sources of confusion. Students found it challenging to decide when to use 'current switched on' versus 'current switched off' equations. Additionally, they sought clarity on the comparison between resistors and inductors, and the use of energy to visualize RL and CL circuits.",Related to Current,"I am still confused about finding the direction through lenz law.
