why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear. 
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz. 
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me. 
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?
I'm a bit confused by how the equations relate together so more explanation and examples would be great. 
The concept of dielectrics weakening the electric field inside of a capacitor. Some Diagrams in the Capacitance Defined part 4 video showed the net electric field was decreasing inside of a material acting as a dielectric however the electric field was not shown to be flowing through the material in other diagrams so I'm curious about how exactly that electric field is being decreased.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.

I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.

   *Revised*: ""Several students found the relationship between charge density, current density, and electric fields confusing, with some struggling to grasp how these quantities relate to each other.""

2. **Clarify Capacitor Arrangement**: Instead of listing multiple points about series and parallel capacitors, combine them into one point to maintain focus on the topic of capacitors.

   *Revised*: ""Students were confused about the distribution of charge and the application of capacitance formulas for capacitors in series and parallel, as well as determining when capacitors are in parallel.""

3. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: The summary currently includes points about understanding electric current in insulators and visualizing concepts, which are broader topics that go beyond capacitors. Removing these will make the summary more concise and focused on capacitors.

36,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on electric/uniform fields challenging, with several key concepts causing confusion. The calculation of dipole moments in non-uniform fields and understanding how dipoles behave in uniform fields were particularly troublesome. The relationship between electric fields and forces, as well as the directionality of these forces, also proved difficult for some students to grasp. Additionally, the pace of the lecture during practice problems was noted as a potential barrier to understanding, with students requesting more time to absorb information after each problem.",Electric/Uniform Field,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force. 
In today's class, I found it confusing how dipoles work in a uniform electric field. The second to last example I found confusing where it asked if the dipole would attract to the plate. 
The example of a neutral wall having a net force towards a negatively charged balloon when the balloon is brought near the wall.
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.

1. **Clarify Dipole Behavior in Uniform Fields**: Since multiple students found dipoles in uniform fields confusing, consider dedicating more time to explain and provide additional examples of how dipoles behave in such fields. This could include explaining the torque and potential energy of dipoles in detail, as suggested by some students.

2. **Explain Electric Field vs. Electric Force**: To address the confusion between electric fields and forces, provide a clear distinction between the two concepts and how they relate to each other. This could involve explaining that electric fields are a measure of the force per unit charge, while electric force is the actual force experienced by a charged object.

3. **Slow Down During Practice Problems**: Given the feedback about the pace of practice problems, consider slowing down after completing each problem to allow students time to copy down the steps and absorb the information. This could involve pausing for a few seconds to a minute after finishing each problem to let students catch up.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students grappled with several key concepts in the electric/uniform field lecture. Notably, the behavior of dipoles in uniform fields caused confusion, with students struggling to understand torque, potential energy, and the attraction/repulsion dynamics. To enhance comprehension, dedicating more time to explain and illustrate dipole behavior in uniform fields, including detailed examples, is recommended. Additionally, clarifying the distinction between electric fields (force per unit charge) and electric forces (actual force experienced) would benefit students. Lastly, slowing down during practice problems to allow time for note-taking and information absorption was suggested by students to improve their understanding and engagement."

 I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems. 
 Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
 The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole 
 The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating. 
 I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
 projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant 
 The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent. 
 The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
 I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other. 
 projectile motion and falling monkey
 I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about. 
 The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
 The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
 The FBD drawings 
 I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
 How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
 Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
 There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion. ",50,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I'vealways had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made alot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophatrelative velocity question correct.

1. **Eliminate repetitive phrases**: Instead of repeatedly mentioning that students found TopHat questions engaging, summarize it as ""Students appreciated the interactive nature of TopHat questions.""
2. **Highlight specific benefits**: Instead of a general ""helped maintain focus,"" mention the specific benefits like ""allowed students to reinforce their understanding"" and ""enabled active participation.""
3. **Avoid mentioning the lecture**: Remove the phrase ""during the lecture"" to make the summary more concise and focused on TopHat questions.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students appreciated the interactive nature of TopHat questions, which enabled active participation and reinforced their understanding of projectile motion concepts. They found the real-world scenarios, such as the monkey problem, engaging and helpful in visualizing complex ideas. The questions also allowed students to apply their knowledge of kinematics and relative motion in a fun and interactive way."
51,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on vector addition engaging and interactive, with the use of breakout rooms and TopHat questions fostering collaboration and immediate application of concepts. The clear, step-by-step process of vector addition resonated with many, as did the real-life examples like the hockey puck and walking yeti. The use of unit vectors to find total length and the application of trigonometry in vector addition were also highlighted as interesting aspects. Some students appreciated the multiple methods demonstrated for solving problems, while others found the distinction between adding and subtracting vectors particularly helpful. The interactive format, with its mix of theoretical concepts and practical examples, was well-received.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too

I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

1. **Clarify the use of '2T'**: Instead of mentioning 'two tensions (2T)' vaguely, explicitly state that '2T' refers to the tension force in the rope above the pulley being equal to the tension force in the rope below it, plus the weight of the man. This helps students understand why the force pulling the man up is double the tension force.

2. **Emphasize the role of free body diagrams (FBDs)**: Highlight that the confusion lies in setting up FBDs for such systems, not just understanding the concept of two tensions. Suggest that students practice drawing FBDs for similar scenarios to solidify their understanding.

3. **Explain the origin of tension vectors**: Clearly state that the two tension vectors originate from the pulley system, with one vector pointing upwards (supporting the man) and the other downwards (supporting the crate). This helps students visualize the forces acting on the system.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students grappled with the man and pulley example, particularly the concept of '2T'. They struggled to understand why the force pulling the man up is twice the tension force in the rope, which is due to the weight of the man being added to the tension force above the pulley. Many found setting up free body diagrams (FBDs) for such systems challenging, as they had difficulty identifying and representing the two tension vectors originating from the pulley system, one supporting the man and the other the crate. Some also expressed confusion about the equations used to solve these problems. To improve understanding, clearer explanations of the first example's FBD and the derivation of its equation, along with practice in drawing FBDs for similar scenarios, would be beneficial."

1. **Clarify the Source of Two Tensions**: To make the summary more concise and focused, explicitly mention that students were confused about the source of the two tension vectors in the middle block's free body diagram. This confusion stemmed from not understanding that the block is acted upon by tensions from both above and below, unlike the top and bottom blocks.

   *Revised*: Students struggled to comprehend the source of the two tension vectors in the middle block's free body diagram, as they didn't initially grasp that it experiences tensions from both the top and bottom blocks.

2. **Simplify the Tension Doubling**: Instead of mentioning the pulley problem, directly address the doubling of tension in the context of the 3-blocks example to keep the focus on this specific topic.

   *Revised*: Students found it challenging to understand why the tension on the middle block was doubled, with some initially misunderstanding that the tension from the top block is equal to the combined tension from the bottom block.

3. **Remove Unnecessary Details**: Eliminate the mention of students' difficulties in starting the problem and drawing the free body diagram, as these are general challenges that do not directly relate to the 3-blocks example.

The relationship between normal force and friction was a key takeaway, with students learning that friction is proportional to the normal force. The idea of 'cold welds' at the atomic level causing friction was intriguing to many, and they enjoyed seeing how different coefficients of friction could change situations. Students also liked solving problems involving the coefficient of friction, finding it similar to solving force diagram problems.",Coefficient of Friction,"I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level.

 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.

 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
 i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped

 Use of multiple free body diagrams in one problem
 That it is easier to prevent an object from moving than to slow it down with friction
 I thought that learning that surface area didn't really contribute to the force of friction was interesting
 I like the question with the two blocks where one was pushed on top of the other.
 I found the his explanation with the force of friction interesting
 I thought the fact that more SA being on a surface not creating for static friction was interesting

 I found the group questions most interesting since they required both calculation and some conceptual knowledge on our part.

The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me.

 I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting 
 The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn't kill you
 I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem. 
 The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.

Some students suggested more detailed explanations and examples to solidify their understanding of the topic.",Right-Hand Rule,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",74,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).

1. **Clarify the 2D application**: Specify that students had difficulty visualizing the Right-Hand Rule on a 2D graph and determining when it would be considered left-handed. This will help focus the improvement on this specific aspect.

2. **Emphasize positive/negative directions**: Highlight that students struggled with understanding how to determine if the result of a cross or dot product is positive or negative, and how this relates to the Right-Hand Rule. This will help target this particular confusion.

3. **Provide more practical examples**: Suggest offering additional practical examples, especially those involving 2D graphs and determining positive/negative directions. This will help address the specific challenges students faced, rather than a general call for more examples.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on the Right-Hand Rule generally clear, but several struggled with its application, particularly in 2D graphs and determining positive/negative directions. Many appreciated practical examples and interactive activities like Top Hat questions, but some found the rule's application confusing, especially when visualizing it on a 2D graph and understanding when it would be considered left-handed. Students also expressed difficulty in determining if the result of a cross or dot product is positive or negative, and how this relates to the Right-Hand Rule.

I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question.

 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more

 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.

79,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding the 'Dinosaur Question', a key topic in today's lecture.

Some students found the problem challenging but grasped the solution once explained, while others suggested exploring alternative methods or examples for better comprehension.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity

1. **Clarify the use of positive and negative directions**: Instead of mentioning ""both positive and negative,"" specify that students were unsure about whether each dinosaur needed its own direction or if one could be used for the whole system. This was a significant point of confusion for them.

2. **Emphasize the importance of identifying the correct kinematic equation**: Rather than a general mention of using the right equation, highlight that students struggled with knowing which kinematic equation to start with and when to apply each equation in the dinosaur problem.

3. **Address the challenge of applying concepts to multiple objects**: Instead of a passing mention, emphasize that students found it difficult to extend their understanding of the dinosaur problem to scenarios involving more than two objects, as this was a notable source of confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered several challenges with the 'Dinosaur Question', a central topic in today's lecture. The primary sources of confusion were:

1. **Direction and Sign of Accelerations**: Students struggled to understand whether each dinosaur required its own positive and negative direction or if one could be used for the entire system. Clarifying this point could significantly improve their comprehension.

2. **Selecting the Appropriate Kinematic Equation**: Students found it difficult to determine which kinematic equation to start with and when to apply each equation in the dinosaur problem. Emphasizing the importance of identifying the correct equation and providing guidance on when to use each could be beneficial.

3. **Applying Concepts to Multiple Objects**: Students had trouble extending their understanding of the dinosaur problem to scenarios involving more than two objects. Addressing this challenge explicitly could help students better grasp the concepts.

While some students found the problem challenging initially, they understood the solution once explained. Others suggested exploring alternative methods or examples to enhance comprehension."

It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long.

I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.

 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.

 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.

I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos.

 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",88,"Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end.
I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.
Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took awayfrom the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we allget used to the format.
I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling.
The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did.
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning ofthe lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after Iused it for the first question I got the hang of it.
For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract.
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going towork, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting ananswer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policiesbefore starting the first question would be useful.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing andtough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had,and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and tothe Top Hat one.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions.
The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RAand RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when tosubtract.","Suggestions:

 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.

 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?

 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",96,"I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.

1. **Clarify Specific Confusions**: Instead of mentioning ""several points caused confusion"", list the top two specific confusions students had with FBDs, such as:
   - ""Students found it challenging to create FBDs for systems with multiple objects, particularly when one object slides on another.""
   - ""Determining the correct forces to include in FBDs was another area of confusion for students.""

2. **Combine Similar Concerns**: Merge the concerns about the coefficient of friction and the difference between static and kinetic friction into one point:
   - ""Students sought clarification on the concept of the coefficient of friction, its units, and the distinction between static and kinetic friction.""

3. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: To make the summary more concise and focused on FBDs, remove the point about rearranging equations, as it's less directly related to the topic of FBDs and more about problem-solving skills.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) mostly clear, but two specific points caused confusion. The primary challenges were:

1. **Creating FBDs for Complex Systems**: Students found it challenging to create FBDs for systems with multiple objects, particularly when one object slides on another. This included understanding how to combine forces from different objects and how to account for friction between them.

2. **Identifying Relevant Forces**: Determining the correct forces to include in FBDs was another area of confusion for students. This was evident in their struggles with problems involving blocks on top of each other and blocks sliding on surfaces.

Additionally, students sought clarification on the concept of the coefficient of friction, its units, and the distinction between static and kinetic friction."

1. **Clarify the Vector Nature of Centripetal Acceleration**: Instead of mentioning the confusion around the acceleration vector pointing inwards, explicitly state that students struggled to grasp the vector nature of centripetal acceleration, which is always directed towards the center of the circle, regardless of the object's motion.

2. **Distinguish Between Centripetal Force and Other Forces**: To address the confusion about what forces can be considered centripetal, revise the summary to emphasize that students had difficulty differentiating between centripetal force and other forces (like normal, friction, or tension) that might be present in circular motion scenarios.

3. **Specify the Need for More Examples on Drag Force**: Rather than a general call for more examples, specify that students would benefit from additional examples of drag force calculations, especially those involving variable densities and substances, to better understand and apply the drag force formula in different contexts.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on circular motion challenging, with a particular struggle in understanding the vector nature of centripetal acceleration, which always points inwards towards the center of the circle. Many had difficulty distinguishing between centripetal force and other forces present in circular motion scenarios, such as normal, friction, or tension. The application of drag force, especially in problems involving variable densities and substances, caused confusion, with students seeking more examples to clarify the calculation and application of the drag force formula. Additionally, the rapid pace of the lecture made it difficult for some to grasp concepts and derive equations, with a call for more in-depth explanations and examples, particularly for centripetal force and drag force, to enhance understanding of these topics."
105,"SUMMARY: Students found the topic of terminal velocity challenging, with many struggling to understand how to set up equations, particularly when dealing with different densities like air and water. The transition between materials and the onset of terminal velocity were also confusing concepts. Some students felt the lecture moved too quickly, especially during the derivation of equations, and desired more examples or in-depth explanations. A few students expressed uncertainty about the application of centripetal force and drag force, while others found the topic of circular motion and net force confusing.",Terminal Velocity,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.

 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.

 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.

 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity

1. **Clarify the Key Concepts**: To make the summary more concise, focus on the core misunderstandings about terminal velocity. Highlight that students struggled with:
   - Setting up equations, especially when dealing with different densities (air and water).
   - Understanding the transition between materials and the onset/end of terminal velocity.
   - The application of centripetal force and drag force in relation to terminal velocity.

2. **Simplify the Language**: To improve focus, use more straightforward language. Instead of ""challenging"" or ""confusing,"" consider using ""difficult to grasp"" or ""unclear."" For example, ""Students found the concept of terminal velocity difficult to grasp, particularly when setting up equations for different densities.""

3. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: To keep the summary concise and focused on terminal velocity, remove points that are peripheral to the main topic. For instance, students' comments about centripetal force, circular motion, and net force can be mentioned briefly, but the summary should primarily revolve around terminal velocity. Also, remove comments about the pace of the lecture and the desire for more examples, as these are general feedback rather than specific to terminal velocity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the concept of terminal velocity difficult to grasp, particularly when setting up equations for different densities like air and water. The transition between materials and the onset/end of terminal velocity were unclear to many.

 The decision matrix
 I'm confused on how we are supposed to test our prototypes
 How metrics were different than criteria 
 I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
 The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
 Nothing was confusing and the weighted decision matrix was actually explained very well.
 i am running on not much sleep everything is confusing including English ",109,"it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgotthat we didn’t have to do the whole thing, so I got confused.
It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
I wasn’t completely sure about what to do for the in class activitybecause the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had todo some of it, but it wasn’t completely clear about what parts we weresupposed to do.
I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the modulevideo but I didn’t feel that we talked about making these models a lotuntil after we did the in-class activity.
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
I just think the assignments are confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify Task Requirements**: Specify in the summary that students were unclear about the extent of the in-class activity, i.e., whether they needed to complete the entire weighted decision matrix (WDM) or just start it. This was a significant source of confusion.

2. **Distinguish Criteria and Metrics**: Highlight that many students struggled to differentiate between 'criteria' and 'metrics' in the WDM. This confusion could be addressed by providing a clearer explanation of these terms and their roles in the matrix.

3. **Provide Additional Examples or Guidance**: Mention that some students found it challenging to determine specific numbers for metrics and test prototypes. Offering additional examples or guidance on these aspects could help clarify expectations and reduce confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students expressed confusion regarding the scope and requirements of the in-class activity, particularly around the weighted decision matrix (WDM). Many were unsure whether they needed to complete the entire WDM or just start it, leading to uncertainty about how much work was expected. Additionally, students struggled to distinguish between 'criteria' and 'metrics', with some misunderstanding their roles in the matrix. To address these issues, clearer instructions specifying the extent of the activity and a more detailed explanation of criteria and metrics could be provided. Furthermore, some students found it challenging to determine specific numbers for metrics and test prototypes, suggesting that additional examples or guidance on these aspects would be beneficial. Having TA support in breakout rooms or providing instructions before starting the activity could also help alleviate these confusions."

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Combine similar points to make the summary more concise. For instance, ""breakout rooms"" and ""group discussions"" can be merged, and ""chat function"" and ""peer-to-peer support"" can be combined as well.

2. **Focus on Information Exchange**: Highlight the specific ways students found value in exchanging information. For example, mention that they enjoyed ""discussing different types of data"" and ""hearing others' opinions on solving CoGo Bike Share's problem"".

3. **Emphasize Active Learning**: Students appreciated the hands-on approach of analyzing data and creating problem statements. Make sure to include this in the summary to emphasize the active learning aspect of information exchange.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture engaging and valuable due to the numerous opportunities for information exchange and active learning. They appreciated the use of breakout rooms for group discussions and data analysis, allowing them to collaborate, bounce ideas off each other, and support one another in resolving Excel issues via the chat function. Students found particular value in discussing different types of data, hearing diverse opinions on solving CoGo Bike Share's problem, and actively engaging with the data to create problem statements. This interactive approach to exchanging information fostered a collaborative learning environment that resonated with students."

I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing.

1. **Specify the confusion about Assignment 13**: Instead of mentioning ""Assignment 13"" twice, combine the points into one sentence to make it more concise: ""Some students struggled to understand the specific requirements and constraints for Assignment 13 and how to provide evidence for the reliability of chosen unit conversion tools.""

2. **Clarify the request for more guidance**: Instead of listing multiple areas where students want more guidance, combine them into one sentence to focus on the main topic: ""Students requested more detailed guidance on energy unit conversions and calculations to better understand and complete their assignments.""

3. **Avoid mentioning non related confusions**: To keep the summary focused on energy calculations and units, remove the sentence about the difference between criteria and constraints, as it was not a major point of confusion related to the topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found today's lecture on energy calculations and units largely clear and straightforward.

1. **Eliminate repetitive phrases**: Instead of repeatedly saying ""some students struggled with"" or ""a few expressed confusion about"", combine these instances to make the summary more concise. For example, ""Several students found calculating coal CO2 emissions and determining required coal amounts challenging.""

2. **Clarify the main points**: To better focus on Assignment 13, explicitly state that students understood the economic analysis and payback periods, but struggled with the environmental impact section and specific data requirements for it. This helps to highlight the key areas of confusion.

3. **Remove less significant issues**: While it's important to mention the capital investment equation, the three-year payback yield section was only mentioned once. To keep the summary more focused, consider removing this less significant issue to save space.

1. **Clarify Specific Values**: To improve the summary, explicitly mention that students were confused by the varying values of CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline presented in different slides, both in the lecture and the in-class activity. This discrepancy caused uncertainty and should be addressed to ensure consistency in calculations.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the lecture clear but were confused by the varying values of CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline presented in different slides, causing uncertainty in their calculations.""

2. **Emphasize Conversion Struggles**: Instead of mentioning ""some students struggled with the conversion aspects,"" highlight that many students found the conversion process confusing and could benefit from additional guidance or examples.

   *Revised*: ""Many students found the conversion process from gallons to miles challenging and would appreciate more guidance or examples.""

3. **Specify In-Class Participation Criteria**: Instead of saying ""some students were unclear about the criteria for in-class participation,"" specify that students were confused about the required format and final answer for the in-class activity.

   *Revised*: ""Students were unclear about the required format and final answer for the in-class activity, seeking more specific criteria.""","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the lecture on CO2 emission calculations clear and generally straightforward. However, several key areas caused confusion:

1. **Inconsistent Values**: Students were puzzled by the varying values of CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline presented in different slides, both in the lecture and the in-class activity. This inconsistency led to uncertainty in their calculations, with some groups unsure which number to use.

2. **Conversion Challenges**: Many students found the conversion process from gallons to miles confusing and would benefit from additional guidance or examples to better understand this aspect of the calculations.

3. **In-Class Activity Criteria**: Students were unclear about the required format and final answer for the in-class activity, seeking more specific criteria to ensure they were completing the assignment accurately.

Addressing these areas will help clarify the topic of CO2 emission calculations for students and improve their understanding and confidence in performing these calculations."

There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.

 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture.

 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!!

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Combine similar points to make the summary more concise. For instance, merge the points about working in groups and exploring different perspectives, and about finding the project relevant and challenging.

2. **Highlight Key Aspects of Problem Scoping**: Emphasize the key aspects of problem scoping that students found interesting, such as identifying stakeholders, users, and their needs, and learning about different roles and methods in problem scoping. This will make the summary more focused on the topic.

3. **Use Student Quotes**: Incorporate direct quotes from students to illustrate their engagement and understanding of problem scoping. This can make the summary more compelling and provide a clearer picture of student learning. For example, ""I found the process of problem scoping interesting...you need to view the problem from a variety of perspectives"" or ""The different roles of problem scoping and how it helps engineers...was very interesting.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture's focus on problem scoping engaging and insightful. They appreciated the collaborative aspect of working in groups, which allowed them to explore the problem from various perspectives and identify key stakeholders, users, and their needs.

I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting 
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
 I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
 I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
 I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
 The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
 I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting. 
 I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class. 
 I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
 The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
 Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was. 
 I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
 I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
 I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
 looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact 
 I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
 I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work. 
 I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later. 
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about. 
 I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.

147,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture straightforward overall, with the main confusion arising from understanding and applying the 'laminar approach'.

Specific aspects causing confusion included calculating volume as a function of height, using regression lines, and understanding the required values and models. Some students also sought clearer instructions on assignments and more explanation of statistical measures like r^2, SST, and SSE.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.

1. **Specify the power calculation aspects:** Instead of a general ""some aspects,"" mention specific power calculation topics that students found unclear, such as the total power calculation for the Upper Reservoir and the factors involved in determining pressure head. This makes the summary more focused and actionable.

   *Revised:* ""Some students were unsure about how to calculate the total power for the Upper Reservoir and the factors involved in determining pressure head, such as the height and density of the water.""

2. **Combine related confusions:** Group related confusions together to make the summary more concise. For instance, combine the confusion about in-class activities and exam instructions.

   *Revised:* ""Some students expressed confusion about the lack of detail in the exam instructions and the absence of clear communication regarding in-class activities.""

3. **Remove less relevant confusions:** While it's important to include all student reflections, not all confusions are equally relevant to the focused topic of power calculation. For example, confusion about the use of Excel for assignment A12 is less relevant to power calculation than confusion about the pressure head calculation.

   *Revised Summary:* ""Students found the lecture on power calculation mostly clear, but some aspects required further clarification. A few were unsure about how to calculate the total power for the Upper Reservoir and the factors involved in determining pressure head, such as the height and density of the water.

1. **Narrow down the focus**: Instead of mentioning multiple assignments (in-class, project four, assignment 16), focus only on the most mentioned or critical ones to make the summary more concise. In this case, focus on assignment 16 as it was mentioned the most.

2. **Use specific student quotes**: To illustrate the confusion better, include specific quotes from students' reflections. This will make the summary more engaging and provide concrete examples of the issues faced.

3. **Avoid repetition**: The summary mentions ""confusing"" multiple times. Instead of repeating this, use synonyms or rephrase to make the summary more varied and engaging.

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions):**

SUMMARY: Students struggled to understand the requirements for assignment 16, with many expressing confusion about what was expected of them. One student noted, ""I was confused on what parts we had to complete,"" while another stated, ""The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages."" Some students found the scope of the assignment too broad, with one commenting, ""The open-endedness of A16 was confusing."" Others had difficulty understanding the purpose of the assignment, with one student saying, ""I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained.""","REFINED SUMMARY: Students struggled to grasp the requirements for Assignment 16, with many expressing bewilderment about the expected tasks.

I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.

the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of.

 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths

 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms.

 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations 
 I think we should've talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing.

 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
 Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
 We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms. 
 I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could've been a could idea. 
 The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models. 
 I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10.  In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
 It wasn't clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
 The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn't sure what values I needed to find Ph. 
 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams

1. **Clarify the Use of Laminar Approach**: To make the summary more concise and focused, explicitly state that students were confused about the application of the laminar approach in creating mathematical models and deriving equations from tables. This will help to highlight the main issue related to the laminar approach.

   *Revised*: Students struggled with applying the laminar approach to create mathematical models and derive equations from given tables.

2. **Specify Variable Selection and Calculation**: To improve the focus on the topic, emphasize that students were unsure about which variables to use and how to calculate them for their models using the laminar approach.

   *Revised*: Students were unclear about selecting appropriate variables and calculating them for their models using the laminar approach.

3. **Highlight In-Class Assignment Confusion**: To maintain the focus on the laminar approach, mention that some students found the in-class assignment confusing due to insufficient guidance on how to use the laminar approach, while others appreciated the practical experience despite initial confusion.

   *Revised*: Students found the in-class assignment confusing due to lack of guidance on using the laminar approach, but appreciated the hands-on experience once they understood the method.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students struggled to apply the laminar approach, specifically in creating mathematical models and deriving equations from tables.

 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

1. **Clarify Assignment A10 Details**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, combine the confusion points about Assignment A10 into one major point. Instead of listing parts 4 and 5 separately, mention them together as a single issue: ""Students were unclear about the specific requirements and expectations for parts 4 and 5 of Assignment A10, involving mathematical models and the laminar approach. They requested more detailed explanations or examples to better understand these aspects of the project related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir.""

2. **Combine In-Class Activity Concerns**: Merge the concerns about the in-class activity into one point to improve focus. ""Students found the in-class activity challenging, with confusion around finding reliable sources for general information and correctly citing them in APA format, specifically determining the source type (journal, website, excerpt, etc.).""

3. **Project Goals and Milestones**: Instead of listing multiple points about project goals and milestones, combine them into one clear sentence: ""Students sought more detailed information about the project's goals, milestones, and specific requirements related to the Tom Sauk Reservoir to better understand what was expected of them.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on the Tom Sauk Reservoir mostly clear, with a few key areas causing confusion. The primary concern was the lack of clarity regarding Assignment A10, specifically the requirements and expectations for parts 4 and 5, which involve mathematical models and the laminar approach for the reservoir project. Students requested more detailed explanations or examples to better understand these aspects. Additionally, students found the in-class activity challenging, with confusion around finding reliable sources for general information and correctly citing them in APA format, particularly determining the source type.

Students suggested providing more detailed explanations and examples to clarify expectations for future assignments.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing

 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand

196,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion about several aspects of assignments, particularly A08. Many felt the instructions were unclear or insufficient, with some struggling to understand what was expected of them. The process of handling missing data in Excel was a common point of confusion, with students requesting more examples and guidance. Additionally, students sought clarification on the purpose and use of the 'new data' tab in A08. Some also found the due dates and submission processes for assignments confusing.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!

 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify the purpose of the Skittles data used in class**: To address the confusion about the purpose of the Skittles data used in class, consider revising the summary to explicitly state that the Skittles data used in class was different from the one provided for Assignment 08. This could help students understand why they were working with a different dataset.

   *Revised sentence*: ""Students were confused about the purpose of the Skittles data used in class, as it was different from the one provided for Assignment 08.""

2. **Simplify the x-axis conversion explanation**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic, simplify the explanation of converting the x-axis from numerical values to percentages. Instead of mentioning the uncertainty about an easy way to do this, emphasize that students need guidance on how to perform this conversion.

   *Revised sentence*: ""Students struggled with understanding how to convert the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in the Skittles example and sought guidance on how to perform this conversion.""

3. **Remove the mention of probability and z-scores**: Since the summary is focused on the Skittles example, remove the mention of students needing more practice with probability and z-scores in relation to the Skittles example. This will make the summary more concise and focused on the specific topic.

   *Revised summary*: ""Students found the Skittles example confusing in two main aspects. Firstly, they struggled with understanding how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages and sought guidance on how to perform this conversion. Secondly, they were unsure about the purpose of the Skittles data used in class, as it was different from the one provided for Assignment 08.""","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the Skittles example confusing in two main aspects.

1. **Eliminate Repetition**: The summary mentions ""idea generation"" and ""brainstorming"" multiple times. To make it more concise, consider using these terms only once and referring to them as ""techniques"" or ""methods"" thereafter.

2. **Focus on Key Aspects**: The summary touches on various aspects of the lecture. To keep it more focused on the topic of idea generation and brainstorming, consider highlighting only the most significant points, such as the diversity of methods discussed, the interest in biomimicry examples, and the practical application of these techniques in group activities and design projects.

3. **Quantify Student Interest**: Instead of saying ""significant interest"" in biomimicry, consider quantifying the interest by mentioning the number of students who found it interesting or the frequency with which it was mentioned in reflections. This makes the summary more concrete and data-driven.

**Revised Summary** (based on suggestions): SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on idea generation techniques engaging and relevant. They appreciated the variety of methods discussed, with many finding the biomimicry examples, particularly the beetle research video, intriguing. Over 60% of students mentioned the practical value of these techniques for their engineering studies, with several enjoying the application of these methods in group activities and design project brainstorming sessions. While some initially found biomimicry confusing, it ultimately sparked curiosity and interest.","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the lecture on idea generation techniques engaging and relevant.

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Some reflections mention similar points about group work. To make the summary more concise, combine these points instead of listing them separately. For example, instead of mentioning ""group clarification sessions"" and ""in-class activity"" separately, you could say ""group activities and discussions"".

2. **Highlight Student Growth**: Emphasize how group work helped students develop skills or understand concepts better. For instance, ""Students found group work beneficial for understanding and approaching assignments, with one student mentioning it helped them connect with team members and improve their teamwork skills.""

3. **Quantify Student Engagement**: To provide a clearer picture of student engagement, consider including a quantifiable aspect. For example, ""Nearly half of the students mentioned that the group activities helped them generate ideas and understand the assignment better."" This gives a more concrete idea of the impact of group work on student learning.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students overwhelmingly found group work to be a valuable and engaging aspect of the lecture. Nearly half of the students mentioned that group activities and discussions helped them generate ideas, understand the assignment better, and connect with their team members.

There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. 
Nothing 
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. 
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
 The confusing part of today's class was how to address stakeholders. 
 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
 I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
 I didn't think much was confusing in today's class, as I felt I understood the material very well. 
 More details about what is due for the first milestone 
 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
 Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
 Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
 Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
 The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
 The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
 The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
 Nothing really
 In the beginning, we weren't sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
 The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
 nothing was confusing
 How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
 The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
 Nothing
 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.

1. **Consolidate Similar Concerns**: Group similar student confusions together to make the summary more concise. For instance, merge the concerns about Assignment 16 details (milestone submission, sections due) into one point.

2. **Prioritize Major Project Concerns**: While acknowledging all student reflections, prioritize the points that affect the majority of students or have the most significant impact on their understanding of the project. For example, the timeline and workload of the project were mentioned by multiple students and could be given more prominence in the summary.

3. **Avoid Repetition**: The summary mentions both ""Assignment 16"" and ""the project"" interchangeably. To improve focus, stick to one term (e.g., ""Assignment 16"") to avoid confusion and repetition.

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions):**

SUMMARY: Students found today's lecture clear and straightforward, with few major confusions regarding project details. However, several students sought clarity on specific aspects of Assignment 16. Many wanted more details on the first milestone submission, with some noting discrepancies between the Brightspace and assignment documents. Others were unclear about the extent of background information required and how to effectively incorporate stakeholders. Additionally, several students found the project's tight timeline and workload challenging. Some also sought guidance on how to objectively measure safety improvements and how to empathize with diverse users, particularly for online students.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found today's lecture clear and straightforward, with few major confusions regarding Assignment 16.

We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)

 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
 Nothing
 the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear 
 I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details",413,"The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test.
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.
How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Combine and Simplify**: Merge the points about testing virtual prototypes and developing a testing protocol into one concise point to avoid repetition. For example, ""Students struggled to understand how to effectively test virtual prototypes and develop a testing protocol, with some unsure if CAD platforms allow testing.""

2. **Remove Less Relevant Points**: The summary mentions that some students found the assignment details confusing, including which CAD software to use. While this is relevant, it's less focused on the core topic of CAD and prototyping. Consider removing or minimizing this point to keep the summary more concise and focused.

3. **Clarify the Major Challenge**: The summary could be strengthened by clearly stating the major challenge students faced with CAD. For instance, ""The primary challenge students faced with CAD was understanding how to create functional and testable prototypes using virtual models, given their team's separation and limited resources."" This suggestion combines and simplifies some of the original points and highlights the main issue students struggled with regarding CAD.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students' primary challenge with CAD was understanding how to create functional and testable virtual prototypes, given their team's separation and limited resources. They struggled to grasp how to effectively test these prototypes and develop a testing protocol, with some unsure if CAD platforms allow testing. The level of detail required in prototypes also caused confusion. Students sought clarification on what materials to use for prototyping, especially when working remotely."

Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart. 
 I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
 Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
 I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment. 
 There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
 I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth. 
 I did not find anything confusing in todays class. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
 I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
 This class was well informed and well taught
 The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
 Nothing, everything was clear.
 More details about how to calculate the 3 year payback period

1. **Remove Irrelevant Details**: The summary mentions that some students found the carbon emission calculations initially confusing, but this detail is not directly related to the topic of Gas Density. Removing this will make the summary more focused and concise.

2. **Clarify Students' Confusion about Density**: The summary could be improved by explicitly stating that students were confused about the relevance of density in the in-class activity, rather than suggesting it might have been intended to mislead them. This will ensure the summary accurately reflects students' reflections.

3. **Simplify the Sentence Structure**: The original summary has some complex sentence structures. Simplifying these will make the summary easier to understand and more concise. For example, ""Some students also mentioned that the carbon emission calculations were initially confusing, but later examples helped clarify the process"" could be simplified to ""Some students found the carbon emission calculations initially confusing, but later examples helped clarify the process.""

**Revised Summary**: SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on Gas Density clear and straightforward. A few students expressed uncertainty about the relevance of density in the in-class activity. Overall, students understood the topic well and found it relevant to their ongoing project.","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students found the lecture on Gas Density clear and straightforward.
