Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.
the binomial theorem 
Simple charge with torque 
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3. 
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me. 
 Everything in the video was clear and concise. Not much else needs to be added. 
 Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such? 
 Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well. 
 I think the tophat questions overall were the most difficult part about class. ",36,"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don’t think the answered were explained in depth enough
I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force.

Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify Dipole Behavior**: To address the majority of student concerns, explicitly highlight the behavior of dipoles in uniform fields in the next lecture. Break down the process of calculating dipole moments and relate it to the electric field's direction and magnitude.

2. **Electric Field vs Electric Force**: Dedicate a section to differentiate between electric field and electric force, emphasizing their distinct roles and how they interact. Use visual aids or examples to illustrate this concept.

3. **Pacing during Practice Problems**: While not directly related to the Electric/Uniform Field topic, student feedback on Professor Nero's pace during practice problems is valuable. In future lectures, ensure there's a brief pause after completing each problem to allow students to catch up and absorb the information. This will help maintain engagement and understanding throughout the lecture.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students grappled with understanding dipoles' behavior in uniform electric fields, particularly calculating dipole moments and their orientation. To clarify, the next lecture should emphasize the relationship between dipole moments and the electric field's direction and strength. Additionally, students struggled to distinguish between electric field and electric force; dedicating a section to differentiate these concepts and illustrate their interaction will be beneficial. Lastly, while not content-specific, students found Professor Nero's pace during practice problems challenging. In future lectures, ensuring a brief pause after completing each problem will allow students to absorb information better and maintain engagement."

 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem

This can be phrased as, ""While some students managed to understand the complex problem with their group's help, others found it difficult to apply their studied concepts independently.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students encountered significant challenges during the exam, with 75% describing it as 'very hard' or 'VERY tough'. The primary source of confusion was interpreting time and understanding the relationship between a thrower and kicker in a football scenario, as reflected by multiple students. While group work proved beneficial for some, enabling them to tackle the complex problem together, others struggled to apply their studied concepts independently. Despite the difficulty, students generally agreed that the exam was fair, with a mix of positive and negative feedback, such as ""great experience"" and ""VERY tough"" respectively."
47,"SUMMARY: Students found the ""Monkey Problem"" engaging and intriguing, with many citing it as the most interesting part of the lecture. The problem, involving a monkey falling from a tree while a hunter shoots at it, helped illustrate the independence of horizontal and vertical motions in projectile motion.

51,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on vector addition engaging and informative, with the interactive format, including breakout rooms and TopHat questions, being particularly appreciated. The clear, step-by-step process of vector addition resonated with many, as did the real-life applications and word problems that helped illustrate the concept. The use of unit vectors to find total length and the comparison of altering angles versus using trigonometry were also notable points of interest. Some students found the distinction between adding and subtracting vectors particularly helpful, while others enjoyed the hands-on practice and the opportunity to work in groups. The variety of vector addition problems presented was also found to be useful.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.

 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.

 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.

 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms

1. **Eliminate Redundancies**: Combine similar student reflections to make the summary more concise. For instance, instead of mentioning ""cold welds"" and ""atomic interactions causing friction"" separately, you could combine them as ""students found the molecular explanation of friction, such as 'cold welds', intriguing.""

2. **Focus on Static Friction**: While the summary does focus on static friction, it could be more direct. Consider starting the summary with ""Students found the concept of static friction, specifically its ability to exceed the normal force, captivating."" This immediately highlights the key aspect of static friction that students found interesting.

3. **Highlight Key Applications**: Students enjoyed applying static friction concepts to problems. To make this point more impactful, you could specify the types of problems they found engaging, such as ""calculating coefficients of friction, determining the ease of moving objects, and applying coefficients to boxes on slopes."" This provides more context and shows the breadth of their engagement with the topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the concept of static friction, specifically its ability to exceed the normal force, captivating.

1. **Clarify Force Directions**: To address the recurring confusion about force directions, consider dedicating a section or a problem set to explicitly explaining and practicing the directionality of forces, especially in tension problems and free body diagrams.

2. **Real-life Analogies**: To help students connect theoretical concepts to real-life examples, incorporate more relatable analogies and everyday scenarios in the explanation of tension forces and other challenging concepts. This could involve using visuals or asking students to share their own examples.

3. **Consistent Explanation of Newton's Laws**: To address the varied understanding of Newton's laws, ensure consistent and clear explanations of these laws throughout the course. This could involve providing concise, student-friendly definitions and emphasizing their practical applications.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found conceptual problems, particularly those involving tension forces, challenging. Many struggled to connect real-life examples to theoretical concepts, with the 'salami' and 'two men pulling on a rope' problems being notably confusing. The directionality of forces and vectors, as well as determining positive and negative directions for net force (fnet), caused significant difficulty. To improve understanding, students suggested more practice problems, clearer explanations for conceptual questions, and better integration of mathematics with conceptual understanding. Additionally, students found Newton's laws and inertial reference frames confusing, indicating a need for consistent, clear explanations and relatable analogies to enhance comprehension."

In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.

 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing

 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)

 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.

 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle.

 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Nowwhen I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end ofclass I was beginning to understand through techniques like the tracemethod.
Need more description about how you know what directions you drawvectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to findthe expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two othervectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the firstvector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused andothers in my breakout room were too.
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic.
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtractand when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not knowif you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them.
It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics.
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graphproblem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity inorder to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors inthe scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectorsby Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows tosuit a given equation when they are all out of order.
However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how theyaffect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know yousaid that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, speciallythe purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Suggestions:

1. **Clarify Vector Subtraction Rules**: To improve the summary, explicitly mention that students were confused about the rules for vector subtraction, especially when vectors are not in the same direction. This confusion was evident in their responses to the Yeti problem and Top Hat questions. Consider adding: ""Students struggled with understanding when to subtract vectors, particularly when they are not in the same direction.""

2. **Emphasize the Importance of Unit Vectors**: While the original summary mentions unit vectors, it's crucial to highlight the significance of this topic. Many students expressed confusion about their purpose and application. Revise the summary to: ""Students also found unit vectors challenging to understand and apply, with many seeking more context and explanation on this topic.""

3. **Address the Use of Top Hat**: Instead of just mentioning that some students found Top Hat confusing, specify that they missed partial points due to uncertainty about submission times. This could be rephrased as: ""Some students struggled with using Top Hat for interactive questions, leading to missed partial points due to uncertainty about submission times and navigating between Zoom and Top Hat windows.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the Vector Math lecture clear and engaging, with a few areas of confusion. The main topics covered were the application of sine and cosine functions, vector stacking, vector subtraction, and the use of unit vectors. Students struggled with understanding the rules for vector subtraction, particularly when vectors are not in the same direction, as evidenced by their responses to the Yeti problem and Top Hat questions. Unit vectors posed another challenge for many students, who sought more context and explanation on their purpose and application. Lastly, some students struggled with using Top Hat for interactive questions, leading to missed partial points due to uncertainty about submission times and navigating between Zoom and Top Hat windows. Despite these areas of confusion, students appreciated the clear explanations and found the lecture efficient. They suggested additional examples and clarification on specific topics to further enhance their understanding."
87,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on angles clear and mostly easy to follow, with a few areas of confusion. Some students struggled with understanding when to use sine or cosine in vector math and which angles to apply based on the chosen function. The application of unit vectors and angle conversions also caused confusion among some students. A few students expressed a desire for more in-depth explanations of the pictures drawn during the lecture and their application to numerical problems. Overall, students found the lecture efficient and well-taught, with some suggestions for slowing down during problem-solving steps and providing more detailed explanations for incorrect answers during Top Hat questions.",Angles,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.

 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer.

93,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on two blocks and forces/systems engaging but challenging, with several top hat questions sparking confusion. The primary sticking points were conceptual understanding and application of forces, particularly when multiple forces were involved, such as in stacked blocks or blocks on inclines. Students struggled with combining free body diagrams for multiple blocks and determining which forces to consider. Some also expressed difficulty in differentiating between static and kinetic friction and identifying when to use each. Despite these challenges, students appreciated the practical examples and exam questions provided, requesting more time for problem-solving and clearer explanations for complex concepts.",Two Blocks/Forces/Systems,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
 The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
 This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
 I thought that the last question was confusing 
 The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
 The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on. 
 i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
 The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
 I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
 The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem. 
 The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
 The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
 Pushing down increasing normal force
 Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
 do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
 The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
 Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
 The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads. 
 What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
 The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction. 
 I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ",93,"When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.

The two blocks with the ice and friction between them","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify the use of 'systems'**: Some students struggled with combining free body diagrams for multiple blocks and determining which forces to consider. To improve the summary, explicitly mention the confusion around the concept of 'systems' and how to apply it to multi-block problems.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the lecture on two blocks and forces/systems challenging, particularly when applying the concept of 'systems' to multi-block problems. They struggled with combining free body diagrams and identifying relevant forces.""

2. **Specify the confusion with stacked blocks**: While the original summary mentions stacked blocks as a source of confusion, it would be more helpful to specify that students were confused about the force needed to move the top block when there's friction between the blocks.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the problem with stacked blocks, where the top block had to be moved against friction between the blocks, particularly confusing.""

3. **Highlight the need for more examples**: Instead of a general request for more time for problem-solving, specify that students would benefit from more examples where the problem is split into two systems.

   *Revised*: ""Students appreciated the practical examples but requested more examples where the problem is split into two systems to help them understand the application of forces better.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on two blocks and forces/systems challenging, particularly when applying the concept of 'systems' to multi-block problems. They struggled with combining free body diagrams and identifying relevant forces, with the problem of stacked blocks causing significant confusion. Students were unsure how to calculate the force needed to move the top block when there was friction between the blocks. Despite these challenges, students appreciated the practical examples and exam questions provided, requesting more examples where the problem is split into two systems to help them understand the application of forces better. Some students also expressed difficulty in differentiating between static and kinetic friction and identifying when to use each."

 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before. I'm just a little unclear as to what the units are for each one.",105,"I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g’s tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I wasconfused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variableswould end up cancelling.
The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first.
I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used.
A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify the Equation Setup:** To make the summary more concise, combine the confusion about setting up equations for terminal velocity and understanding drag force into one point: ""Students struggled with setting up and understanding the equation for terminal velocity, including the variables involved in drag force.""

2. **Simplify Density and Forces:** Instead of listing multiple instances of confusion with varying densities and forces, simplify it to: ""Students found it challenging to apply terminal velocity concepts to problems involving different densities and forces.""

3. **Combine Circular Motion and Centripetal Force:** Since many students found both circular motion and centripetal force confusing, combine these into one point: ""Students had difficulty understanding and applying concepts related to circular motion and centripetal force, especially in the context of terminal velocity.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture on terminal velocity challenging, with key areas of confusion including:

1. **Equation Setup and Drag Force Understanding:** Students struggled with setting up and understanding the equation for terminal velocity, including the variables involved in drag force, such as density, velocity, and drag coefficient.

2. **Application to Varying Conditions:** Students found it challenging to apply terminal velocity concepts to problems involving different densities (e.g., air vs. water) and forces (e.g., gravity, buoyancy, drag).

3. **Circular Motion and Centripetal Force:** Students had difficulty understanding and applying concepts related to circular motion and centripetal force, especially in the context of terminal velocity, and determining when these forces are acting.

Additionally, some students expressed uncertainty about when and how to use terminal velocity in practical scenarios."
106,"SUMMARY: Students found the concept of metrics and their application in a weighted decision matrix (WDM) somewhat challenging to grasp. While some appreciated the clarity of the explanation, others struggled to distinguish between criteria and metrics, understand how to assign numerical values to criteria, and determine which metrics to use for non-numerical data. The in-class activity, which required starting a WDM, also caused confusion, as students were unsure about the extent of the task and how to proceed without a full understanding of metrics.

I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for. 
Learning how to work better with histograms 
 It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13

1. **Consolidate Similar Concerns**: Combine the various aspects of Assignment 13 that students found confusing, such as variables, graphing processes, and project constraints, into a single point. This will make the summary more concise and focused. For example, ""Students struggled to understand the specific requirements and processes for Assignment 13, including variables, graphing, and project constraints.""

2. **Highlight the Need for Clarification on Key Concepts**: Instead of listing multiple areas where students needed more information, emphasize the most significant ones. For instance, ""Students required more guidance on understanding the difference between criteria and constraints for Assignment 13.""

3. **Simplify the Summary**: Instead of listing multiple points, try to combine them into a single, clear sentence that encapsulates the main issue. For example, ""Students found Assignment 13 challenging due to unclear requirements, a lack of guidance on data collection and unit conversion, and confusion between criteria and constraints.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found Assignment 13 challenging due to unclear project requirements, a lack of guidance on data collection and unit conversion, and confusion between criteria and constraints."

1. **Specify the Frequency**: Instead of saying ""Some slides were also incomplete or cut off,"" mention that this issue occurred ""in multiple slides during the in-class activity,"" to emphasize the frequency and thus the impact on students' understanding.

2. **Clarify the Impact**: Rather than stating ""making it difficult for students to understand and apply the information,"" say ""resulting in students struggling to perform calculations and complete activities,"" to highlight the practical implications of these slide issues.

3. **Consolidate Confusion Points**: Combine the issues of differing values and incomplete slides into a single point to make the summary more concise: ""Students were confused by inconsistent data (e.g., varying CO2 emission values) and incomplete information (e.g., cut-off slides) on PowerPoint slides, hindering their ability to accurately perform calculations and participate in in-class activities.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students reported confusion due to PowerPoint slide issues, primarily during in-class activities. The main problems were inconsistent data, such as varying CO2 emission values (e.g., 87 vs. 8887 grams/gallon), and incomplete information, like cut-off slides, which occurred multiple times.

131,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture clear and interactive, with most understanding the course's requirements and the BikeShare project's details. However, several expressed confusion about assignment due dates, the course schedule, and the organization of homework on Brightspace. Some also sought more information on projects, especially the CATME assignments and the BikeShare project's specifics. A few were unclear about group formations and whether groups would change throughout the course.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me

 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?

 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.

1. **Clarify Due Dates and Schedule**: To address the repeated confusion about assignment due dates and the course schedule, consider providing a clear, centralized calendar or timeline in the next lecture or on Brightspace, highlighting all key deadlines and milestones.

2. **Project Details**: To alleviate student concerns about project specifics, provide more detailed instructions or a project outline for the BikeShare project and CATME assignments in the next lecture or on the course website. This could include clear objectives, deliverables, and assessment criteria.

3. **Group Formation and Changes**: To avoid misunderstandings, explicitly state in the next lecture or on the course website whether groups will remain the same throughout the course or if they will change for different assignments or projects.","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students appreciated the clarity and interactivity of the lecture, understanding the course's requirements and the BikeShare project's basics. However, confusion persisted regarding assignment due dates, the course schedule, and Brightspace organization. To address these concerns, the instructor should provide a centralized calendar or timeline outlining key deadlines and milestones in the next lecture or on Brightspace. Additionally, more detailed project instructions or outlines are needed for the BikeShare project and CATME assignments, including clear objectives, deliverables, and assessment criteria. Lastly, the instructor should explicitly communicate whether groups will remain the same throughout the course or change for different assignments or projects."

It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints","Suggestions:

1. **Eliminate Redundancies**: Combine similar student reflections to make the summary more concise. For instance, instead of mentioning ""interesting"" multiple times, you could say ""students found the activity engaging and insightful, with many expressing surprise at their individual impacts.""

2. **Focus on Key Findings**: Highlight the most significant findings from the reflections. For example, emphasize that some students found they would need multiple Earths to sustain their current lifestyles if everyone lived like them. This could be rephrased as ""students were particularly struck by the revelation that some would require multiple Earths to support their current lifestyles if everyone lived similarly.""

3. **Clarify the Impact of the Activity**: Instead of stating that the activity sparked interest in understanding personal energy consumption and the need for change, be more specific. For instance, ""the activity prompted students to consider their daily habits and the role of engineers in mitigating climate change."" This makes the summary more focused on the learning outcomes of the activity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students found the carbon footprint calculation activity engaging and insightful, with many expressing surprise at their individual impacts.

I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.

 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

1. **Clarify Key Regression Concepts**: Instead of mentioning multiple confusing concepts (SSE, SST, r values), focus on the most prevalent one, which is the laminar approach. This was mentioned 17 times in the reflections. Specify that students struggled to understand and apply this concept, especially for assignment A10.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the lecture on regression clear, but many struggled to grasp and apply the laminar approach, particularly for assignment A10.""

2. **Assignment Expectations**: Instead of a general mention of assignment confusion, specify that students were unclear about what was required for assignment A10. This was mentioned 7 times in the reflections.

   *Revised*: ""Students also expressed confusion about the requirements for assignment A10.""

3. **Regression Calculation**: Instead of mentioning regression constants, which was only mentioned once, focus on the confusion around calculating regression lines, which was mentioned 5 times.

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Combine similar student concerns to make the summary more concise. For instance, merge the confusion about power calculation for the Upper Reservoir and the factors contributing to pressure head into a single point.

2. **Use Specific Student Quotes**: To make the summary more engaging and focused, include direct quotes from students' reflections. For example, ""I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir"" or ""I was confused by what factors go into this [pressure head].""

3. **Highlight the Need for Clarification**: Instead of suggesting a ""recap or additional examples,"" specify that clear, step-by-step guidance on power calculations and their components would be particularly helpful to students. This could be achieved through in-class examples, additional resources, or office hours dedicated to this topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** While most students found today's lecture clear, several expressed confusion specifically around power calculations.

   *Revised*: ""Over 40% of students found Assignment 16 expectations unclear, while 20% struggled with project scope, and 15% were uncertain about gathering stakeholder information.""

3. **Avoid Repetition**: Instead of mentioning ""Assignment 16"" repeatedly, use a shorthand or refer to it as ""the assignment"" once you've established the topic.

nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent

 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
 What parts of the assignment to complete
 I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
 I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it. 
 Nothing
 The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
 There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
 How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

 I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
 I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester. 
 Everything is pretty clear
 I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained

1. **Eliminate Redundancy:** Combine similar points to make the summary more concise. For instance, instead of mentioning both 'Assignment 16' and 'Project Four', you could say 'Upcoming assignments' once, as they both contributed to student confusion.

2. **Use Active Voice:** Change passive voice sentences to active voice to make the summary more engaging and easier to understand. For example, instead of ""Students were unclear about..."", you could say ""Students struggled to understand..."".

3. **Focus on Specifics:** Instead of generalizing that 'several aspects' of deliverables caused confusion, specify which aspects were most confusing, such as 'task requirements', 'project scope', and 'information gathering methods'. This will provide more actionable information for the instructor.

**Revised Summary:** **SUMMARY:** Students found the lecture clear overall, but specific aspects of upcoming assignments caused confusion. Students struggled to understand task requirements for Assignment 16 due to conflicting information in Brightspace. The scope of Project Four and the expectations for the upcoming Friday's assignment were also unclear.

I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of.

 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.

 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
 I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
 I was confused on how to do the in class activity
 I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
 I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together. 
 I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.

 Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
 Didn't really have much to be confused about
 what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
 The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
 Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
 How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel 
 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations 
 I think we should've talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing.

 I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.

1. **Clarify the Laminar Approach's Purpose**: Many students were confused about the laminar approach itself. Start the summary by briefly explaining what the laminar approach is and why it's important, to provide context for the students' confusion.

   *Revised Sentence*: ""Students struggled to grasp the laminar approach, with many unsure about its purpose and how to apply it.""

2. **Specify the Types of Confusion**: Instead of generalizing that students found the laminar approach confusing, break down the confusion into specific aspects. This will help the instructor target the areas that need more clarification.

   *Revised Sentence*: ""Students expressed confusion in various aspects of the laminar approach, including deriving mathematical equations from tables (23 mentions), creating mathematical models (17 mentions), and identifying relevant variables and equations (12 mentions).""

3. **Highlight the Need for Clear Instructions and Examples**: Many students mentioned that lack of clear instructions or examples contributed to their confusion. Emphasize this point to encourage the instructor to provide more guidance in future lectures.

   *Revised Sentence*: ""Students also found in-class activities and assignments confusing due to insufficient or unclear instructions and examples (18 mentions), suggesting that more guidance could help alleviate their confusion.""","**REFINED SUMMARY**: Students struggled to grasp the laminar approach, with many unsure about its purpose and how to apply it.

One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.

It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify the relevance of gasoline density**: To make the summary more concise and focused, explicitly address the confusion around gasoline density. Instead of mentioning it as a side note, consider starting the paragraph with this point to highlight its significance. For example, ""Students found the inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity to be the most confusing aspect of today's lecture.""

2. **Combine similar confusions**: Group together related confusions to streamline the summary. For instance, combine the confusion around carbon emissions calculations and the source of the numbers used into a single point. This could read, ""Several students struggled to understand the calculation of carbon emissions, with some unsure about the source and reliability of the numbers used.""

3. **Remove less relevant points**: To keep the summary focused on gasoline density, consider removing points that are less related or mentioned by fewer students. For example, the confusion between assumptions and unreliable data was only mentioned by one student. Removing this point will help keep the summary concise and focused on the most prevalent confusions.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** The most significant confusion among students in today's lecture was the relevance and inclusion of gasoline density in the in-class activity. Many students found it unclear why this information was provided and how it related to their calculations. While the majority of the lecture on environmental impacts and trade-offs was well-received, several students struggled to understand the calculation of carbon emissions, with some unsure about the source and reliability of the numbers used."

I found it interesting that the engineers took so many unethical short cuts to build the Taum Sauk Reservoir in a cheaper way.
I liked discussing the formulas and variables that contribute tovolumetric flow rate, as well as the causes of the reservoir’s failureand other engineering failures.
I also loved the video about the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I thought that the reasons for the taum Sauk failure and how they could have been prevented were really interesting.
The many failures that the designers and operators allowed to happen compounding in the overall failure of Taum Sauk.
I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
I found the reasons for dam failure to be quite captivating. That was a cool part of class to investigate those failures.
The destruction of Taum Sauk was very interesting because understanding adisaster is always very intriguing and interesting to look at.
finding the various reasons behind the reservoir failure was enjoyable
The failures of the Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting and the fact that cutting corners backfired
Taum sauk failure","Suggestions:

1. **Eliminate Repetition**: The summary mentions ""engineering failures"" and ""Taum Sauk Reservoir"" multiple times. To make it more concise, consider using phrases like ""the reservoir's failure"" or ""the case study"" instead of repeating the reservoir's name.

   *Revised*: ""Students found the analysis of the reservoir's failure and other engineering disasters engaging...""

2. **Focus on Student Learning**: The original summary starts with what students found engaging. Instead, begin with what they learned to emphasize the educational value of the topic.

   *Revised*: ""Students learned the importance of thorough analysis, attention to detail, and ethical decision-making in preventing engineering disasters like the reservoir's failure...""

3. **Highlight Specific Causes**: To make the summary more focused on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, mention one or two specific causes of its failure that students found interesting or insightful.

   *Revised*: ""...students found it insightful to explore specific causes of the reservoir's failure, such as negligence in land surveying and cutting corners on safety measures.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students learned the importance of thorough analysis, attention to detail, and ethical decision-making in preventing engineering disasters like the reservoir's failure. They found it insightful to explore specific causes of the reservoir's failure, such as negligence in land surveying and cutting corners on safety measures, and appreciated understanding how these oversights led to catastrophic consequences. The real-world implications of these failures resonated with students, highlighting the significance of their role as future engineers. The interactive nature of the class, including group work and breakout rooms, was also well-received, providing an engaging platform for students to discuss and learn from these case studies."

The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.

 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",305,"The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusingbecause it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came tocalculations.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, sinceit wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum SaukReservoir project.
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.

1. **Clarify Laminar Approach and Mathematical Modeling**: Combine these two points as they are closely related. Instead of ""understanding and applying the laminar approach"" and ""mathematical modeling,"" consider ""Clarifying the Laminar Approach and Mathematical Modeling for the Tom Sauk Reservoir Project."" This will make the summary more concise and focused.

2. **Specify Project Expectations**: Merge ""more detailed explanations of the project's goals, milestones, and expectations"" with ""the new project A10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it"" and ""I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that."" This will create a single, clear point about the need for more specific project information.

3. **Sources and Citation Guidelines**: Combine ""acceptable sources for research"" with ""the citation part was confusing"" and ""figuring out which way to cite my source was confusing."" This will result in a single point about the need for clarity on sources and citation guidelines.

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions):**
SUMMARY: While many students found the lecture clear, several expressed confusion regarding specific aspects of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project (Assignment 10). Key areas of uncertainty included clarifying the Laminar Approach and Mathematical Modeling, specifying project expectations and milestones, and understanding acceptable sources and citation guidelines.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** While many students found the lecture clear, several expressed confusion regarding specific aspects of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project (Assignment 10).

182,"SUMMARY: Students expressed confusion regarding due dates and deliverables for Assignment 10 and the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. Some found the assignment instructions unclear, with parts 4 and 5 being particularly confusing. A few students struggled to understand the laminar approach and mathematical models required. Clarifying these aspects and providing more detailed explanations could help students better understand their upcoming tasks.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.

 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

They needed guidance on handling missing data in Excel, understanding the z-score and its application, and the purpose and data sources for in-class activities like the skittle example. Additionally, students found assignment due dates and submission processes unclear. To improve, instructors could provide more detailed explanations and examples for these aspects in future lectures and assignment briefs."
197,"SUMMARY: Students found the lecture on Statistics and Probability engaging but sought more clarity on specific topics. The calculus formula for finding area under the curve and the application of probability from histograms were particularly challenging. The z-score, its calculation, and its relationship to probability and standard deviation were also areas where students requested more explanation and practice. Some students struggled with understanding and navigating assignment expectations, especially for A08, and found the skittle example confusing in terms of data transformation and usage. A few students also expressed a desire for more in-class examples using Excel to illustrate concepts.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.

 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Combine similar student confusions to make the summary more concise. For instance, merge ""identifying all relevant stakeholders"" and ""differentiating stakeholders from clients/end-users"" into one point.

2. **Prioritize Major Concerns**: Highlight the most prevalent issues. While some students were confused about unstated criteria, a larger group struggled with identifying any criteria at all. Prioritize this in the summary.

3. **Clarify the Application**: Instead of a general ""application of criteria and constraints,"" specify that students are struggling with how to incorporate these elements into their problem statements. This makes the summary more actionable for the instructor.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students expressed significant confusion regarding the identification and application of criteria and constraints, as well as the distinction and identification of stakeholders in their projects. While some students understood the difference between client needs and stakeholder expectations, many struggled to identify relevant stakeholders and differentiate them from clients or end-users. The majority of students found it challenging to determine which criteria to include in their problem statements, with some unsure about how to incorporate any criteria at all. To address these concerns, students would benefit from targeted guidance on identifying and applying criteria and constraints, as well as strategies for recognizing and engaging with stakeholders throughout their projects."

 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.

I'm still unsure how many base cases we'll need or when to use strong induction instead of mathematical induction
When to use strong induction over weak induction","**Suggestions:**

1. **Eliminate repetitive phrases**: Instead of saying ""Students found strong induction challenging"" multiple times, you could say ""Students struggled with strong induction, with specific aspects causing confusion.""
2. **Combine related concerns**: Merge the issues of determining the number of base cases and choosing the appropriate base case into a single point: ""Students were uncertain about selecting the correct base cases for strong induction.""
3. **Clarify the distinction**: To make the summary more focused, rephrase the distinction between strong and weak induction as ""Students sought clarity on the difference and relative use cases of strong and weak induction.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students struggled with strong induction, with specific aspects causing confusion. They were uncertain about selecting the correct base cases and applying the induction hypothesis effectively. The distinction between strong and weak induction, including their respective use cases, was unclear to many students. They sought guidance on when to prefer strong induction over weak induction and how to determine the appropriate number of base cases."

2. **Clarify Key Concepts**: Highlight the key concepts that students found confusing. For example, instead of 'Understanding the behavior of inductors', specify 'Distinguishing the roles of inductors, resistors, and capacitors in circuits'.

3. **Simplify Sentences**: Make the summary more concise by using active voice and combining related ideas. For instance, instead of 'Students expressed confusion...', start with 'Students struggled with...' and list the specific areas they found challenging.","**REFINED SUMMARY:** Students struggled with applying and selecting appropriate equations for RL circuits, including distinguishing when to use 'current switched on' vs. 'current switched off' equations.
