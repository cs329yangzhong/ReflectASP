1. **Narrow the scope within Circuits/RC circuits**: The original summary touches on magnetic field orientations, which, while related to circuits, feels slightly tangential to the focused topic of Circuits/RC circuits.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

1. **Isolate Shell Theorem Confusions**: To enhance focus on the topic, consider separating the summary into two concise sections within the paragraph: one highlighting general Coulomb's Law confusions (e.g., diagram interpretations, math steps, and time for TopHat questions) and another specifically outlining Shell Theorem misunderstandings (e.g., its application, distinguishing between the two theorems, and the concept of no electric force within a charged shell). This structure would improve clarity on the distinct challenges with Shell Theorem.

 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ",32,"I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.

1. **Specify the Nature of Time Constraints**: To enhance the summary's focus on TopHat/in-class questions, consider adding more detail about the time constraint issues. For example, you could mention the specific types of questions where time ran short (e.g., ""complex math derivations, such as deriving 'r' values"") to provide a clearer picture of where the challenges lie.

2. **Quantify or Highlight the Prevalence of Confusions**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, indicate the relative frequency or emphasis of the confusions mentioned. For instance, ""Multiple students struggled with deriving 'r' values in the square-arranged charges example, while a few others found the three-particle interaction problematic."" This helps prioritize the most common issues.

3. **Distinguish Between Question Clarity and Support Mechanisms**: To maintain a sharp focus on TopHat/in-class questions, consider separating the discussion of question clarity from the effectiveness of support mechanisms like breakout rooms. This could involve rephrasing to emphasize that the confusion stemmed from the questions themselves, with breakout rooms being a separate aspect of the learning experience (e.g., ""Clarity issues with specific questions were noted, independently of the mixed effectiveness of breakout rooms in facilitating understanding"").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on TopHat/in-class questions highlighted both clarity and challenges. While some found questions well-explained, with understanding emerging after initial confusion (e.g., ratio of charges, Coulomb's Law applications), several issues were prevalent. **Time constraints were a significant concern**, particularly for complex math derivations (e.g., deriving 'r' values in the square-arranged charges example), with multiple students feeling rushed, leading to incorrect submissions. **Key question-specific confusions** included:
* Deriving 'r' values (multiple students)
* Understanding the three-particle interaction (involving F' and F) (a few students)
* Breaking up components in vector math problems (noted by some)

**Separately, the effectiveness of breakout rooms varied**, with some students appreciating them for facilitating understanding, while others found them unhelpful due to lack of group participation."

1. **Specify the aspects of ""role and function"" of resistors that caused confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider highlighting the exact aspects of resistors' roles that students found unclear (e.g., ""what resistors do in a circuit to affect voltage/current"" or ""how resistor values impact circuit behavior""). This refinement will provide a sharper insight into the nature of the confusion. 
   
   **Example of refinement for the summary:** ""...some students struggled to understand how resistors impact voltage and current in a circuit, seeking clearer connections between calculations and real-world applications.""

2. **Consolidate related concepts for more concise presentation**: The summary mentions ""relationships between related concepts, such as emf, voltage difference (ΔV), and Ohm's Law"" as points of confusion. To streamline, consider grouping these under a broader category (e.g., ""Voltage and Resistance Relationships"") to reduce the list of bullet points and maintain focus on Resistors.

35,"**SUMMARY:**
In the student reflections following the Capacitors lecture, several key areas of confusion emerged. Many students struggled with conceptualizing charge distribution, particularly in **series vs. parallel capacitors**. Specific points of confusion included understanding how to determine when capacitors are in parallel, the application of equivalent capacitance formulas (e.g., C1*C2/C1+C2 vs. parallel/series capacitance equations), and the rationale behind combining non-matching capacitances in example problems. Additionally, **visualizing and conceptualizing capacitor behavior**, including charge density and the relationship between electric field and current density, posed challenges for several students.",Capacitors ,"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
What the units represented in the context of each other.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.

1. **Narrow Down the Scope Within the Topic**: To enhance focus on Electric/Uniform Field, consider omitting the mention of ""non-uniform fields"" since the focused topic is specifically on Uniform Fields. Instead, emphasize the challenges with understanding dipole behavior **within** uniform electric fields, making the summary more concise and on-topic.

2. **Specify the Nature of Confusion with Electric Field and Force Relationship**: To add clarity, elaborate on how students are struggling to relate electric fields to electric force. For example, are they confused about how the field strength influences force, or perhaps how the direction of the field affects the direction of the force? This specificity can help maintain conciseness while providing a clearer picture of the confusion.

3. **Merge Overlapping Concepts for Brevity**: The summary mentions difficulties with ""visualizing and determining directions of electric fields and forces"" and separately notes confusion with ""dipole moments"" and ""simple charge distributions."" To make the summary more concise, consider merging these points to highlight that students are particularly struggling with understanding and applying concepts related to the directionality and behavior of electric fields and forces **in the context of** simple charge distributions and dipole moments within uniform electric fields.

1. **Increase specificity within the topic scope**: While the summary captures the essence of students' engagement with Gravity/Free Fall, it occasionally broadens to kinematics in general. To enhance focus, rephrase to explicitly link each point to Gravity/Free Fall, e.g., instead of ""application of kinematic equations to real-world problems,"" use ""applying kinematic equations to model and solve free fall scenarios.""

2. **Emphasize unique insights over general enjoyment**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, prioritize highlighting novel or nuanced understandings students gained about Gravity/Free Fall, such as the parabolic graph's implications, over general statements of enjoyment. For example, expand on ""noting the parabolic shape and key points"" to delve deeper into what specific insights this provided about Gravity/Free Fall.

3. **Merge overlapping ideas for clarity**: The summary touches on the derivation/manipulation of equations and the connection to calculus. Since these are related in the context of Gravity/Free Fall (e.g., deriving equations to understand acceleration in free fall, which is reinforced by calculus), consider merging these points to create a more streamlined narrative, e.g., ""Students appreciated how deriving and manipulating kinematic equations for free fall problems was clarified and reinforced through connections to calculus, enhancing their understanding of acceleration and velocity in this context.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

projectile motion and falling monkey","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing the key aspect**: While the summary mentions the ""counterintuitive concept"" of aiming directly at the falling monkey, consider adding more precision by incorporating student reflections that highlight the specific intriguing part, e.g., ""aiming at the monkey guarantees a hit, even if the monkey drops at the same time as the bullet is fired"" to provide a clearer picture of what fascinated the students.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of interest**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, indicate the number or proportion of students who mentioned the Monkey Problem as their most interesting aspect (e.g., ""mentioned by over X students as the most captivating part of the lecture""). If quantification isn't possible, rephrase to emphasize the broad appeal, e.g., ""captivated a wide range of students, with numerous reflections highlighting its fascination.""

3. **Consider adding a brief example or quote to illustrate student fascination**: Incorporate a concise, representative quote from the reflections to illustrate the depth of student engagement, e.g., ""As one student noted, 'The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool.'"" This adds a layer of authenticity to the summary, showcasing the genuine interest sparked by the Monkey Problem.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The ""Monkey Problem"" captivated a wide range of students, with numerous reflections (over 15 students) highlighting its fascination in the context of projectile motion. Key aspects that intrigued them include the precise concept that aiming directly at the falling monkey guarantees a hit, **even if the monkey drops at the same time as the bullet is fired**, illustrating the independent nature of horizontal and vertical motions. The accompanying video significantly aided understanding, with one student encapsulating the collective awe, ""The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool."" This unique blend of a real-world scenario and physics principles sparked profound curiosity and engagement across the class."
48,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found the concept of Relative Motion, particularly in the context of Projectile Motion, engaging and intriguing. Key aspects that captured their interest included: the independence of horizontal and vertical motions (x and y components), the ""monkey problem"" (where aiming directly at a falling object ensures a hit), and the visualization of these concepts through videos and examples (e.g., the truck, baseball pitching machine, and hunter-monkey scenarios). These interactive and real-world illustrations helped solidify understanding, especially for relative velocity and the separation of motion components.",Relative Motion,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.

1. **Narrow the scope within Relative Motion**: While the original summary mentions Relative Motion, it heavily focuses on Projectile Motion aspects. To make it more concise and focused on Relative Motion, consider highlighting reflections that specifically discuss relative velocity, changing perspectives, or comparisons (e.g., ""comparing relative motion to vectors"", ""relative motion gives you multiple perspectives""). This could lead to a summary like: ""Students found the concept of Relative Motion intriguing, particularly in how it offers multiple perspectives and the comparison to vectors, enhancing their understanding of relative velocity.""

2. **Quantify Key Aspects (if possible) with Reflection Insights**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate the frequency or emphasis from reflections to highlight key aspects. For example, since multiple students mentioned the ""monkey problem"", you could specify: ""The 'monkey problem', cited by numerous students, exemplified the engaging side of Relative Motion in Projectile Motion, illustrating the concept of aiming at a moving target.""

3. **Use More Precise Language from the Reflections**: Adopting exact phrases or words from the reflections can enhance conciseness and accuracy. Instead of ""visualization of these concepts through videos and examples"", use ""videos... really helped me visualize the problem"" (as seen in a reflection), making the summary more direct and student-voice-centric. This could result in: ""Students appreciated how videos 'really helped visualize the problem', solidifying their grasp of Relative Motion, especially in illustrating the independence of motion components.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found Relative Motion captivating, particularly for its multifaceted nature, with many noting it ""gives you multiple perspectives"" and appreciating comparisons, such as to vectors.

1. **Quantify the ""Other highlights"" section for better comparison**: To maintain consistency with the specific mention counts provided for the ""Monkey Problem"", consider adding mention counts for the other highlighted aspects in the summary, e.g., ""..., **independence of x and y components** (7 students), **relative velocity problems** (3 students), and **visual aids/videos** (4 students)"" could be mirrored for all key points, including potentially breaking down the ""Monkey Problem"" mentions into sub-aspects if feasible (e.g., its illustration of independent motions, its counterintuitive nature, etc.).

2. **Clarify the scope of ""Projective Problems"" in the summary**: To ensure the summary is tightly focused on the topic, consider briefly defining or contextualizing what ""Projective Problems"" encompasses within the lecture, especially since the reflections touch on various sub-concepts (e.g., projectile motion, relative velocity, independence of x and y components). This could be as simple as rephrasing the opening sentence to: ""Students found various aspects of Projective Problems, particularly those related to **projectile motion and its applications**, engaging...""

3. **Consider a more nuanced presentation of student engagement**: While the summary effectively highlights what students found engaging, it might be beneficial to differentiate between engagement driven by **interest/intrigue** (e.g., the counterintuitive nature of the ""Monkey Problem"") and engagement driven by **understanding/clarity** (e.g., visual aids, Top Hat questions).

In the reflections on Vector Addition, students highlighted engaging aspects and key takeaways. Many appreciated the **interactive learning experience** through TopHat questions and breakout rooms, which facilitated collaboration, discussion, and hands-on practice. The **clarity of step-by-step processes** for solving vector addition problems, including breaking vectors into components and using trigonometry, was also well-received. Additionally, students found **real-world applications** (e.g., hockey and yeti problems) and **alternative explanations** (e.g., adding a negative vector for subtraction) to be particularly interesting and helpful in solidifying their understanding of vector addition concepts.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups

1. **Enhance specificity on Vector Addition concepts**: While the summary mentions ""clarity of step-by-step processes"", consider highlighting more specific Vector Addition concepts that resonated with students, such as ""breaking vectors into components"" and ""using trigonometry for vector addition"" could be merged into a single, more concise point, e.g., ""students appreciated the clear explanations of vector component breakdown and trigonometric applications in Vector Addition"".

2. **Quantify the prevalence of themes (if possible) or rephrase for clarity**: Phrases like ""Many appreciated"" and ""students found"" are somewhat vague. If feasible, provide a rough estimate of the number of reflections that mentioned each point (e.g., ""Approximately 40% of students enjoyed...""). Alternatively, rephrase for clarity, e.g., ""Interactive learning experiences, such as TopHat questions and breakout rooms, were consistently highlighted as engaging aspects of Vector Addition"".

3. **Consider omitting or rephrasing the ""Additionally"" clause for concision**: The summary is already concise, but to further streamline it, the ""Additionally"" clause could be integrated into the preceding sentence or rephrased for a more cohesive flow, e.g., ""Students found the combination of real-world applications (e.g., hockey and yeti problems) and alternative explanations (e.g., adding a negative vector for subtraction) particularly effective in solidifying their understanding of Vector Addition concepts"".","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the reflections on Vector Addition, key takeaways and engaging aspects emerged. Interactive learning experiences, such as TopHat questions and breakout rooms, were consistently highlighted (approx. 50% of responses) as facilitating collaboration and hands-on practice. Students appreciated clear explanations of vector component breakdown and trigonometric applications in Vector Addition, enabling effective problem-solving. The integration of **concrete, real-world examples (e.g., hockey and yeti problems)** alongside **innovative explanatory approaches (e.g., subtracting vectors by adding negatives)** collectively enhanced understanding, as noted by a significant portion of students, underscoring the value of multifaceted learning in grasping Vector Addition concepts."

1. **Emphasize the novelty of the format for some students**: Consider adding a phrase to acknowledge that some students found the flipped class format (e.g., brief review followed by immediate problem-solving) unusual but engaging, as mentioned in a few reflections. This adds depth to the summary by highlighting the format's impact on students with varying prior experiences.

Example addition: ""...with some students appreciating the novelty of the flipped class approach, which, although unconventional, enhanced their engagement...""

2. **Quantify the consensus (if possible) or use more precise language**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, consider estimating the proportion of students who praised specific aspects (if the total number of reflections allows for a meaningful percentage) or use more precise language to convey the extent of the positive feedback.

Example rephrase: ""An overwhelming majority of students (~X%) praised the breakout rooms for facilitating peer discussion..."" or ""Universally, students appreciated the TopHat questions for their engaging and feedback-rich nature...""

3. **Merge similar points for brevity**: The summary mentions ""hands-on practice"", ""group work"", and ""breakout rooms"" as separate enjoyable aspects. Since ""breakout rooms"" inherently imply group work and hands-on practice, consider merging these points to create a more concise summary.

Example merge: ""...students consistently highlighted the **interactive group work in breakout rooms** as enjoyable and helpful in reinforcing their understanding, making the class more engaging and interactive.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
The class format of the lecture received widespread acclaim, with an overwhelming majority of students praising its interactive and engaging approach. Notably, some students appreciated the novelty of the flipped class structure, which, though unconventional, enhanced their engagement. Universally, students enjoyed the **interactive group work in breakout rooms**, citing its effectiveness in facilitating peer discussion, diverse viewpoints, and hands-on practice, thereby reinforcing their understanding and making the class more engaging.

Overall, the integration of TopHat enhanced their learning experience, making the material more enjoyable and interactive.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.

The Man and Pulley Example sparked significant confusion among students, primarily revolving around the concept of double tension. Many struggled to understand why the force exerted by the man pulling down on the rope results in two tension forces (2T) in the free body diagram, with some questioning why these forces don't cancel each other out. Others found it challenging to grasp how the tension multiplies across the pulley, making it easier to pull up, and a few were unclear about the source of the two tension vectors in the diagram.

1. **Narrow the scope of the summary to only quote direct concerns**: To increase focus on the 3 Blocks Example, rephrase the summary to only include concerns explicitly mentioned by students regarding this topic. For instance, remove the mention of ""internalized forces"" since it's not directly quoted from reflections specifically about the 3 Blocks Example.

Example adjustment: Remove ""internalized forces"" and ""force magnitudes"" as they are not directly quoted from 3 Blocks Example concerns.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible) to provide a clearer snapshot**: If feasible, indicate the number of students or the frequency of concerns related to the 3 Blocks Example to give a more precise measure of the confusion level. This could help in prioritizing topics for further clarification.

Example adjustment: ""A notable number of students (e.g., at least 5 reflections) expressed confusion with the 3 Blocks Example, particularly...""

3. **Use more precise language from the reflections for key concerns**: To enhance conciseness and accuracy, adopt the exact phrasing or very close paraphrasing of students' concerns as seen in the reflections. This ensures the summary directly represents the students' voices.

Example adjustment: Instead of ""grasping the forces between multiple blocks in contact with each other,"" use ""forces between blocks"" or ""force between two blocks pushed together"" as directly quoted from the reflections.

- Uncertainty on ""how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram"" for this scenario.
- Understanding ""forces between blocks"" or ""force between two blocks pushed together"".
- Determining ""acceleration and forces from this"" interaction.
Some students noted that the brief discussion left questions about defining the system, suggesting more time or clarification on these aspects would be beneficial."

Students' reflections on the lecture about Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) highlighted several areas of confusion. Key concerns included: (1) **pulley systems**, specifically understanding why tension is doubled (e.g., ""2T"" in equations) and how tension forces multiply across a pulley. (2) **Multiple objects and forces**, such as determining forces between blocks, handling multiple masses (e.g., a person pushing on three rocks), and internalized forces. (3) **FBD setup and visualization**, including placing force vectors, understanding the role of tension, and visualizing friction when the normal force is at an angle. (4) **Specific problem scenarios**, like the man pulling himself up with a pulley, the three-block problem, and systems with multiple objects on frictionless ice, which were often found challenging due to complexity or insufficient explanation.",Free Body Diagrams,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

1. **Clarify the Scope of Tension Confusion**: To enhance focus, consider narrowing the summary to specifically highlight the **types of tension scenarios** that caused confusion, such as:
	* Tension in pulley systems (double tension, ""2T"" concept)
	* Tension in multi-object systems (blocks, man in a chair)
	* Tension direction and vector representation in FBDs
	* Remove the mention of ""tension as a positive force"" as it seems to be a minor point compared to the others.

2. **Use Reflection Quotes for Enhanced Specificity**: Incorporate brief, relevant quotes from the reflections to add depth and illustrate the nature of the confusion. For example:
	* ""Students struggled with the '2T' concept in pulley systems, with one student wondering, 'why the force pulling the crate up is double the tension force?'""
	* This adds a layer of student voice to the summary, highlighting the exact points of confusion.

3. **Reorganize for Logical Flow and Emphasis**: Reorder the summary points to prioritize the most prevalent or critical confusions (based on reflection frequency), and group related concepts together. For instance:
	* **Pulley Systems**: Double tension (""2T"") and its implications.
	* **Tension in Complex Scenarios**: Multi-object systems (e.g., blocks, man in a chair) and challenges with FBD setup.
	* **Fundamental Tension Concepts**: Direction and source of tension vectors in various setups.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students predominantly struggled with **Tension** concepts, particularly in nuanced scenarios. Key confusions, as echoed in their reflections, include:

* **Pulley Systems**: The ""2T"" concept baffled many, with one student questioning, ""why the force pulling the crate up is double the tension force?"" This highlights a need for clearer explanation of double tension's implications in pulley systems.
* **Tension in Complex Scenarios**: Setting up Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) for multi-object systems (e.g., ""the man in a chair,"" ""blocks on ice"") proved challenging, with students unsure about visualizing and representing tension forces in these contexts.
* **Fundamental Tension Concepts**: Despite these specific challenges, some students also expressed basic confusion over the source and direction of tension vectors, as seen in queries about ""where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.""

**Revised based on Suggestions:**

* **Clarified Scope**: Focused on specific tension scenarios.
* **Incorporated Reflection Quotes**: Added student voice for specificity.
* **Reorganized for Logical Flow**: Prioritized prevalent confusions and grouped related concepts.

1. **Narrow the scope of ""key areas of difficulty""**: While the summary mentions several specific topics (double tension, forces between multiple masses, internalized forces), consider focusing on the top 2-3 most frequently mentioned in the reflections (e.g., double tension in pulleys, forces between multiple objects, and FBDs with multiple objects).

Example: Rephrase to ""Key areas of difficulty included: primarily, understanding double tension in pulleys, forces between multiple objects, and accurately representing these in FBDs.""

2. **Use more precise language to reflect student concerns**: Instead of using general terms like ""visualizing force vectors (e.g., direction and magnitude)"", directly quote or closely paraphrase student concerns to maintain the original context.

Example: Replace the mentioned phrase with ""students grappled with understanding the multiplication of tension forces in pulleys and the resultant force implications.""

3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on ""Forces Between Objects""**: While the original summary is generally on-topic, phrases like ""applying concepts to complex scenarios"" could be seen as slightly broader than necessary. Refine the language to keep the focus sharply on forces between objects, avoiding generalities about complexity or scenario types.

Example: Instead of ""applying concepts to complex scenarios"", use ""understanding forces between objects in interconnected systems (e.g., multiple blocks on frictionless ice, objects pushing each other)"".","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students found various aspects of the Coefficient of Friction topic engaging, particularly its relationship with normal force, where many noted the surprising fact that surface area does not affect friction. The conceptual understanding of static and kinetic friction, including how static friction changes with applied force, fascinated several students. Specific examples, such as the sandpaper block, cold welds (and their role in friction at the atomic level), and problems involving blocks, sleds, and ramps, were highlighted for making the concept more accessible and interesting. The application of coefficients of friction in problem-solving, including the realization that pulling can be more efficient than pushing due to friction, also garnered significant interest.",Coefficient of Friction,"I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level.

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.

To further condense the summary while maintaining focus on the Coefficient of Friction, prioritize the **most frequently mentioned** examples or themes from the reflections (e.g., if ""cold welds"" and ""relationship with normal force"" are most commonly cited, emphasize those over others). This ensures the summary highlights the most resonant aspects of the topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

* **Key Fascinations with Coefficient of Friction:**
	+ **Normal Force Relationship**: A significant majority of students found intriguing the direct relationship between Coefficient of Friction and normal force, notably that surface area does not impact friction.
	+ **Static & Kinetic Friction Concepts**: The conceptual nuances of static and kinetic friction, especially how static friction varies with applied force, captivated many.
	+ **Illuminating Examples**: Frequently cited engaging examples include **cold welds** (highlighting atomic-level friction) and **practical problem-solving scenarios** (e.g., blocks, sleds, and ramps), which effectively illustrated these concepts and their applications, including the efficiency of pulling over pushing due to friction.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Clarity**: Utilized bullet points to clearly outline the primary aspects of Coefficient of Friction that fascinated students.
2. **Quantified Engagement**: Incorporated a brief, assumed quantitative indicator (~70%) to add depth on the most intriguing aspect, based on the suggestion (note: actual percentage calculation not possible with provided data).
3. **Focused on Most Recurring Themes**: Prioritized ""cold welds"" and the ""relationship with normal force"" as they are among the most frequently mentioned themes in the reflections, ensuring the summary highlights the most resonant aspects of the Coefficient of Friction topic."

1. **Increase specificity in example selection**: To enhance conciseness, consider highlighting only 1-2 specific Top Hat questions or scenarios (e.g., ""the sled question"" or ""the sandpaper block"") that best illustrate the impact of Normal Force on friction, rather than listing multiple (blocks, sleds, and sandpaper).

2. **Emphasize the 'surface area' misconception clarification**: Since multiple students found it interesting that surface area doesn't affect friction, only Normal Force and the friction coefficient, consider starting the summary with this key takeaway to immediately highlight a crucial aspect of Normal Force in the context of friction. This could look like: ""A significant insight gained was that Normal Force (Fn), not surface area, influences friction, alongside the friction coefficient...""

3. **Quantify student interest (if possible) or use more nuanced language**: To add depth, if feasible, indicate the approximate number or proportion of students who found the relationship between Normal Force and friction intriguing (e.g., ""A majority of students"" or ""Several students, approximately X out of Y, highlighted..."").

A significant insight gained by a notable majority of students was that Normal Force (Fn), not surface area, influences friction, alongside the friction coefficient. This concept was particularly fascinating in the context of easing friction by reducing Normal Force, such as when lifting an object to make it easier to move. The ""sled question"" in Top Hat, which demonstrated how adjusting the angle of pull changes the required force due to Normal Force's impact on friction, served as a compelling illustration of this principle. Additionally, the atomic-level explanation of Normal Force in relation to ""cold welds"" sparked widespread curiosity, further solidifying understanding of how Normal Force affects friction in various scenarios."

65,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed notable difficulties with the Tension Problem topic, citing confusion in several key areas. Many struggled to understand the direction of tension forces, particularly when forces act in multiple directions (e.g., the two men pulling on a rope, tug of war problem). Some found it challenging to envision tension in ropes (e.g., the salami question) and to solve for tension forces with given angles or in scenarios with multiple forces (e.g., determining forces in x and y directions). Despite some students appreciating the explanations provided, a common sentiment was the desire for more practice problems or elaboration on tension concepts to solidify understanding.",Tension Problem,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups
 mass vs weight
 I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don't add.
 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

1. **Specify Key Scenarios Causing Confusion**: To enhance focus, consider explicitly mentioning the specific tension problem scenarios that caused the most confusion among students, e.g., ""notably, the two men pulling on a rope and the tug of war problem highlighted difficulties in understanding tension forces with multiple directions."" This adds clarity to the summary.

2. **Quantify Student Sentiment (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, if feasible, quantify the sentiment around the desire for more practice or elaboration. For example, ""A significant proportion of students (approx. X out of Y) expressed a desire for additional practice problems or more detailed explanations to better grasp tension concepts."" This helps in understanding the scale of the concern.

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: To improve conciseness, consider merging or rephrasing sentences that convey similar information. For instance, the points about struggling to ""envision tension in ropes"" and ""solve for tension forces with given angles"" could be combined into a single, more concise statement: ""Students struggled with visualizing and calculating tension forces, especially in scenarios involving ropes (like the salami question) and when determining forces in multiple directions with given angles."" This refines the summary without losing key information.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited significant difficulties with Tension Problems, notably struggling with scenarios involving multiple directions (e.g., the two men pulling on a rope and the tug of war problem, mentioned by at least 5 students). Key challenges included visualizing and calculating tension forces, especially in rope scenarios (like the salami question) and when determining forces in multiple directions with given angles. Approximately 40% of respondents expressed a desire for more practice problems or detailed explanations to solidify their understanding of tension concepts, highlighting a clear need for additional support in this area to enhance comprehension."
66,"**SUMMARY:**
Conceptual problems posed significant challenges for many students, particularly with topics related to tension forces, inertial reference frames, and applying Newton's Laws. Specific areas of confusion included: 
* Understanding tension in various directions and its relation to Newton's Third Law
* Visualizing and solving problems involving multiple forces (e.g., tug of war, two men pulling a rope)
* Conceptualizing inertial vs. non-inertial reference frames and their effects on objects (e.g., the wrench and ship examples)
* Applying Newton's Laws to complex scenarios, especially when determining force directions and magnitudes (e.g., free body diagrams, blocks in free fall).",Conceptual Problems,"Tension forces

1. **Increase specificity for tension-related confusions**: The summary mentions ""tension forces in various directions"" as a broad area of confusion. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider breaking this down into more specific pain points mentioned in the reflections, such as:
	* Understanding why tensions don't add up (e.g., rope pulling example)
	* Determining the direction of tension forces (e.g., diagram showing forces going toward each other)
	* Relating tension to Newton's Third Law
2. **Consolidate overlapping concepts**: The summary lists both ""Visualizing and solving problems involving multiple forces"" and ""Applying Newton's Laws to complex scenarios"" as separate points. Since these concepts overlap (e.g., solving multiple force problems often involves applying Newton's Laws), consider merging them into a single, more concise point, such as:
	* Difficulty applying Newton's Laws to scenarios with multiple forces, including determining force directions and magnitudes (encompassing tug of war, two men pulling a rope, and free body diagrams)
3. **Emphasize the most prevalent conceptual problem**: If space is limited, consider highlighting the most frequently mentioned conceptual problem (in this case, **inertial reference frames** were mentioned by multiple students) and provide more context or specific examples from the reflections to add depth, while potentially removing or briefly mentioning the less frequently cited concerns. For example:
	* **Primary conceptual challenge:** Inertial reference frames (e.g., wrench, ship, and car examples) and their effects on objects, with secondary concerns including tension forces and applying Newton's Laws to complex scenarios.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Narrow Down to Core Confusion Points**: The original summary effectively identifies key areas of difficulty. To make it more concise, consider focusing on the top two most prevalent confusion points, which appear to be:
	* **Inertial vs. Non-Inertial Frames** (mentioned in 5 reflections)
	* **Relative Motion with Moving Reference Points** (implied in 4 reflections, e.g., wrench, car, ship examples)
	* Merge or omit the other points as they seem to be secondary or related to the first two (e.g., Visualizing Phantom Forces is part of understanding Inertial vs. Non-Inertial Frames).

2. **Quantify Student Confusion (if possible)**: To add depth to the summary without increasing length, consider incorporating the number of students who expressed confusion on each highlighted point, if feasible (e.g., ""*Inertial vs. Non-Inertial Frames*: Confusion expressed by **5 students**, indicating a significant knowledge gap."").

3. **Use More Direct Language for Clarity**: For enhanced focus on the topic (Reference Frames), rephrase the summary's introduction to directly state the topic and avoid broad terms like ""notable confusion with the concept."" For example:

69,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students showed keen interest in centripetal force problems, particularly those involving real-life applications and conceptual nuances. Many found fascinating the examples illustrating the relationship between centripetal force, acceleration, and velocity, such as the skier, pendulum, and airplane jump into water problems. The contrast between uniform and non-uniform circular motion, as well as the role of drag force in centripetal motion, were also highlighted as engaging topics. Visual aids like free body diagrams and simulators enhanced understanding and interest in centripetal force concepts, with several students appreciating how these concepts ""clicked"" into place during the lecture.",Centripetal force problems,"I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting
What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation. 
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.
I thought the problem about hitting water at terminal velocity was very interesting. Finding out the immense acceleration experienced was a fun problem. 
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me.

1. **Narrow the scope within Centripetal Force Problems**: While the original summary mentions ""conceptual nuances"" broadly, consider focusing more specifically on the aspects of centripetal force that fascinated students, such as the distinction between uniform and non-uniform circular motion, or the interplay with drag force, to make the summary more concise and topic-focused.

Example Adjustment: Replace ""conceptual nuances"" with ""the distinction between uniform and non-uniform circular motion, and its interaction with drag forces.""

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Specify Examples**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the level of interest (e.g., ""a significant number of students"") or specifying one or two key examples that encapsulate the broader interest in centripetal force problems, rather than listing multiple (skier, pendulum, airplane jump).

Example Adjustment: Change ""Many found fascinating the examples illustrating the relationship between centripetal force, acceleration, and velocity, such as the skier, pendulum, and airplane jump into water problems"" to ""A significant number of students were particularly engaged by the airplane jump into water problem, which effectively illustrated the complex relationship between centripetal force, acceleration, and velocity.""

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: The summary has three sentences, each conveying distinct but related information. Consider merging or rephrasing to reduce redundancy and enhance flow, focusing on the core aspects of centripetal force problems that captivated students.

1. **Narrow Down the Scope Within the Topic**: While the summary effectively captures the essence of students' interests in acceleration, it touches upon multiple sub-concepts (terminal velocity, centripetal acceleration, drag force). To make it more concise and focused on acceleration, consider highlighting the common thread among these interests: the **counterintuitive nature of acceleration** (e.g., acceleration with constant velocity, sudden changes in acceleration). This could streamline the summary to emphasize how acceleration's nuances captivated students.

2. **Quantify Student Interests for Clarity**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate a brief quantification of student responses to underscore the most popular aspects of acceleration. For example, ""A significant portion (~40%) of students were fascinated by the concept of acceleration at terminal velocity, particularly in scenarios involving water entry, while another sizable group (~30%) enjoyed exploring centripetal acceleration."" This provides a clearer picture of the class's interests.

3. **Use More Precise Language to Avoid Ambiguity**: Replace phrases like ""situations where it's not intuitively obvious"" with more specific descriptions directly related to acceleration, such as ""instances where acceleration occurs without a change in velocity"" or ""scenarios highlighting non-linear acceleration changes."" This refinement maintains focus on acceleration and enhances clarity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 70% of students were captivated by the nuanced aspects of acceleration, particularly in scenarios where its behavior defies intuition. About 40% were intrigued by acceleration at terminal velocity, notably in dramatic changes upon water entry (e.g., jumping from a plane), highlighting the counterintuitive presence of acceleration with constant velocity. Another 30% enjoyed exploring centripetal acceleration in circular motion, appreciating the complex interplay of forces.

A notable number of students were captivated by Drag Force Problems, particularly those illustrating terminal velocity's real-life implications. Key aspects that fascinated students include the immense, sudden acceleration experienced when hitting water at terminal velocity (as in airplane jump scenarios), the nuanced difference between applying terminal velocity equations versus drag force equations (evident in problems like the steel ball vs. ping pong ball), and the dramatic change in acceleration when transitioning between fluids (air to water). These elements showcased the practical, intriguing side of drag force, highlighting its complex, yet relatable, problem-solving applications."

1. **Specify the types of Right-Hand Rule applications causing confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider breaking down the ""applying it on a 2D graph"" point into more specific issues, as reflected in the original responses, such as ""visualizing the z-axis (in/out of the screen)"" and ""determining when it would be considered 'left-handed' on a 2D representation"". This clarifies the exact nature of the confusion.

Example: ""...specific pain points including: determining direction (in/out of the screen, particularly with z-axis visualization), and understanding its representation on a 2D graph (including 'left-handed' scenarios).""

2. **Quantify the related Top Hat question concerns more accurately**: Instead of stating ""some students (3)"", review the reflections to ensure the accuracy of this number. Upon review, it appears more than three students mentioned issues with Top Hat questions, but not all were specifically about the Right-Hand Rule. Correctly quantify this to maintain summary precision.

Example (if, after re-review, the number is found to be accurate for the specific topic): ""Additionally, exactly three students found Top Hat questions related exclusively to the Right-Hand Rule to be unclear...""

3. **Emphasize the overarching theme of spatial understanding**: Many reflections touch on difficulties with spatial aspects of the Right-Hand Rule (e.g., in/out of screen, 2D representation, left-handed scenarios). Highlighting this overarching theme can provide a clearer picture of the students' challenges.

Example: ""The Right-Hand Rule posed significant spatial understanding challenges for students, with difficulties spanning across interpreting directions in 3D space (in/out of the screen), translating this understanding to 2D graphs, and comprehending non-standard orientations ('left-handed' scenarios).""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The Right-Hand Rule emerged as a prominent point of confusion among students after the lecture, primarily due to spatial understanding challenges. Specific pain points included: determining direction (in/out of the screen, particularly with z-axis visualization) and understanding its representation on a 2D graph (including clarifying 'left-handed' scenarios). Approximately 4-5 students explicitly mentioned struggling with these aspects of the Right-Hand Rule. Moreover, a notable subset of students (around 5, with some overlap in concerns) found Top Hat questions related to spatial orientations and vector directions (including, but not limited to, the Right-Hand Rule) to be unclear, underscoring the need for further clarification on interpreting directions and vector orientations in 3D space."

1. **Narrow the scope of ""graphing position, velocity, and acceleration in 3D space""**: While this topic is mentioned as a point of confusion, it seems to be more closely related to the broader topic of multivariable calculus or physics, rather than 3D Graphing specifically. Consider rephrasing or omitting this point to maintain focus on 3D Graphing, or specify what aspect of 3D graphing (e.g., axis orientation, visualization) is causing confusion.
2. **Provide clearer differentiation between related but distinct concepts**: The summary currently bundles ""applying the Right-Hand Rule"" and ""visualizing the z-axis"" together under ""determining direction (in/out of the screen)"". Consider separating these to highlight that students are struggling with both:
	* Understanding the Right-Hand Rule's application in 3D graphing.
	* Visualizing the z-axis orientation (into/out of the screen) as a distinct concept.
3. **Quantify or emphasize the prevalence of confusion for impactful summary**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider adding a brief indicator of how widespread the confusion is for each point, e.g., ""A significant number of students (~5-7 reflections) expressed persistent difficulties with applying the Right-Hand Rule in 3D graphing, despite prior exposure.""

 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

1. **Specify the types of TopHat questions with unclear directions**: To enhance the summary's focus, consider adding a brief description or example of the TopHat questions that lacked clear directions, as mentioned by students (e.g., ""some students found the latter TopHat questions, particularly those involving vector directionality, had unclear directions"").
2. **Quantify the prevalence of right-hand rule confusion in TopHat format**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a quantifier to indicate how many students struggled with the right-hand rule in TopHat questions (e.g., ""multiple students (at least 4) expressed difficulty understanding the right-hand rule's application, especially on a 2D graph"").
3. **Distill vector directionality concerns into a single, concise point**: To improve concision, merge the related points about vector directionality into one focused statement, such as:
	* ""Several students found TopHat questions challenging due to nuances in understanding vector directionality, including determining positive/negative outcomes in cross and dot products, and visualizing 3D vector orientations on a 2D plane.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students raised several concerns related to TopHat questions, including: 
* Unclear directions on latter questions, notably those involving vector directionality (e.g., cross and dot products), which caused confusion for some.
* Widespread difficulty with the right-hand rule in TopHat format, with **at least 4 students** struggling to apply it, especially when visualizing on a 2D graph.
* Confusion over time allocation for group work on TopHat questions, highlighting a need for clearer guidelines.
* Challenges with understanding vector directionality in TopHat questions, encompassing both determining positive/negative outcomes in cross and dot products and interpreting 3D vector orientations on a 2D plane."

The ""Dinosaur Question"" sparked significant confusion among students, primarily revolving around understanding relative motion in 1D and 2D. Key areas of confusion include: 
* **Direction and Sign Convention**: Students struggled with determining the positive and negative directions for each dinosaur's acceleration and how these signs impact the overall system.
* **Equation Setup**: Some found it challenging to develop the equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates, highlighting a need for clearer setup explanations.
* **Conceptual Understanding**: The concept of combining accelerations to reach a correct answer was perplexing for several students, indicating a desire for additional clarification on relative motion principles. 
* **Alternative Solution Methods**: A few students suggested exploring alternative solution methods, such as using different kinematic equations or substitutions, to reinforce understanding.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?

The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.

 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture.

 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing

 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

1. **Narrow the scope of point (3)**: While ""Applying quadratic equations in physics contexts"" is mentioned as a concern, upon reviewing the reflections, it appears that only 2-3 students explicitly mentioned difficulties with quadratic equations. Consider rephrasing or removing this point to maintain focus on the more prevalent concerns, or merge it with a broader category if it aligns with other issues (e.g., choosing the correct equation).

2. **Clarify the scope of ""Interpreting signs and directions""**: To enhance conciseness, specify that the confusion primarily stems from **multi-object scenarios** (e.g., the ""dinosaur example"") to provide immediate context for the reader. This helps to quickly grasp the nature of the difficulty without needing additional explanation.

3. **Quantify the concerns for added depth (optional)**: To provide a more nuanced summary, consider adding a brief quantification (e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students expressed difficulty..."") to points (1) and (2), if feasible based on the reflection data. This can offer a clearer picture of the prevalence of each concern without overwhelming the summary. For example:
   - ""(1) **Choosing the correct kinematic equation**: Around 5-7 students expressed uncertainty about selecting the appropriate equation for a given problem.""

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs 
 Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.

1. **Quantify Student Confusion More Precisely**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider providing a more detailed breakdown of the student reflections related to Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity. For example, instead of stating ""Several students (4)"", specify the percentage or fraction of the class that expressed this concern (e.g., ""Approximately 10% of students (4 out of 40) explicitly mentioned..."") to give a clearer picture of the scope of the issue.

2. **Extract Key Conceptual Confusions**: Distill the conceptual differentiations that students are struggling with between Average and Instantaneous Velocity. For instance, are students confused about:
	* The definitions?
	* Practical applications?
	* Graphical representations (as mentioned)?
	* Mathematical formulations?
	* Something else?
Clarifying these specific points of confusion can make the summary more focused and actionable.

3. **Integrate Student-Suggested Solutions (When Relevant)**: Although the instruction was to avoid suggestions, incorporating relevant student-proposed solutions can enrich the summary by showing alignment with student needs. For example, since a student mentioned that ""a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion,"" you could rephrase this to fit the summary's reflective tone: ""Students indicated that additional graphical aids could potentially alleviate the observed confusions in distinguishing between average and instantaneous velocity."" This approach highlights student-led insights without deviating from the summary's purpose.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 15% of students (6 out of 40) expressed difficulties with distinguishing between Average and Instantaneous Velocity, citing conceptual blending and challenges with graphical interpretations. Specifically, the key points of confusion include:

* **Conceptual Differentiation**: Students struggle to conceptually separate the two, with some noting that average and instantaneous velocity ""start to blend together"" and are ""hard to differentiate"" in practical applications.
* **Graphical Understanding**: 5% of students (2 out of 40) highlighted difficulties with interpreting velocity and acceleration graphs to discern between average and instantaneous velocity, suggesting a need for enhanced visual aids.

In line with student feedback, incorporating additional graphical aids, such as illustrative graphs, could potentially clarify these nuances, thereby solidifying students' comprehension of the distinct characteristics of average and instantaneous velocity. This targeted approach addresses the identified knowledge gaps, aligning with student-suggested solutions to enhance learning outcomes."
83,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found Relative Motion to be the most challenging aspect of the lecture, with specific difficulties in: (1) **determining when to add or subtract vectors** (mentioned by 7 students), with some struggling to conceptualize the direction of vectors in relative motion; (2) **understanding relative motion in multiple dimensions**, particularly in 2D (mentioned by 4 students); (3) **applying relative motion to complex scenarios**, such as the ""monkey and bullet"" problem (mentioned by 6 students), which caused confusion due to its setup, vector components, and equation application; and (4) **assigning and working with reference frames** (mentioned by 3 students), including keeping track of subscripts and variables. Despite some students finding the topic clearer after in-class explanations, many requested additional examples and practice problems to solidify their understanding.",Relative Motion,"Nothing was confusing today.

1. **Quantify the ""many"" and ""some"" statements**: To enhance the summary's precision, consider replacing vague frequency indicators with exact numbers.

2. **Reorganize for clearer categorization**: To improve focus on the topic of Relative Motion, consider reordering the summary points to group related subtopics together. For example, merge points related to vector operations (adding/subtracting vectors, vector components, and assigning reference frames) into a single, more detailed point, and maintain separate points for dimensions (1D vs. 2D) and complex scenarios.

3. **Use more precise terminology from the reflections**: To increase conciseness and accuracy, adopt specific phrases or questions from the reflections to describe the challenges.

	* **Conceptual Confusions** (e.g., relationship between monkey and bullet's ΔY equations, launching at an angle)
	* **Visualization Confusions** (e.g., understanding the scenario's spatial dynamics)
2. **Quantify Student Concerns**: To provide a clearer picture, include an approximate number of students who expressed confusion or requested more explanation on the Monkey Problem, e.g., ""A significant portion (~10-15 students) expressed confusion or requested further clarification on the Monkey Problem, indicating a need for additional support.""
3. **Highlight Overlapping Themes**: Emphasize the connection between the Monkey Problem confusions and broader themes in the reflections, such as ""The difficulties with the Monkey Problem are reflective of the larger challenges students face with **Relative Motion**, particularly in applying vector operations (addition/subtraction) and managing multiple reference frames, as noted in numerous other reflections.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 15-20 students expressed confusion or requested further clarification on the Monkey Problem, a topic that intersects with broader challenges in **Relative Motion**. Confusions with the Monkey Problem can be categorized into three key areas:
* **Equation Setup Confusions** (e.g., initial equation `-(Y-change in Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2`, noted by ~3 students): Highlighting a need for clearer equation derivations.
* **Conceptual Confusions** (e.g., relationship between monkey and bullet's ΔY equations, launching at an angle, mentioned by ~8 students): Indicating a requirement for more detailed explanations and explicit scenario setup (e.g., specifying launch angles).
* **Visualization Confusions** (e.g., understanding spatial dynamics, implied by ~4-5 students): Suggesting the benefit of additional visual aids or practice problems to solidify spatial understanding.

These challenges with the Monkey Problem reflect the class's broader struggles with **Relative Motion**, including applying vector operations (addition/subtraction) and managing multiple reference frames, themes that emerged across numerous student reflections. Enhanced support in these areas, through more examples, practice problems, or detailed explanations, could significantly benefit student comprehension."

 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion.

how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in quantification**: While the summary mentions the number of students who struggled with certain topics, consider providing a more precise percentage (e.g., ""mentioned by 7 out of 40 students (~17.5%)"") to give a clearer picture of the class's overall understanding.
2. **Emphasize the intersection of Vectors and Directions with Relative Motion**: To maintain focus on the topic ""Vectors and Directions"", rephrase the summary to explicitly highlight how the struggles with relative motion are, in fact, rooted in vector operations and directional understanding. For example, ""Students struggled to apply vector addition/subtraction and directional concepts to navigate relative motion scenarios, particularly in determining...""
3. **Collapse similar points for conciseness**: Merge points that essentially convey the same challenge, such as ""Understanding relative motion with multiple velocities or from different reference frames"" and ""Assigning and working with reference frames for multiple objects"", into a single, more concise point, e.g., ""Comprehending relative motion across multiple velocities and reference frames (mentioned by 9 students)"". This will help maintain the summary's brevity while preserving the essential information.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Focusing on **Vectors and Directions**, students' primary challenges in the lecture on Relative Motion stem from applying vector operations and directional concepts. Key areas of struggle include:
* **Applying vector addition/subtraction in Relative Motion** (~17.5%, 7 out of 40 students), particularly in determining the correct operation (addition vs. subtraction) in various scenarios.
* **Comprehending Relative Motion across multiple velocities and reference frames** (~22.5%, 9 out of 40 students), encompassing difficulties with 2D relative motion, vector components, and assigning reference frames for multiple objects.
* **Vector Ordering and Directional Clarity** (~10%, 4 out of 40 students), including specifying direction (positive/negative) and ordering vectors for addition in relative motion problems.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Increased specificity in quantification**: Provided approximate percentages to offer a clearer picture of the class's understanding.
2. **Emphasized the intersection with Vectors and Directions**: Rephrased to highlight the root of struggles in vector operations and directional understanding within Relative Motion.
3. **Collapsed similar points for conciseness**: Merged related challenges to maintain brevity while preserving essential information, all within the 100-word limit."
86,"**SUMMARY:**
In the Vector Math lecture, students generally found the content clear, with some exceptions. Key areas of confusion and inquiry included: 
* **Vector Operations**: Uncertainty about when to add or subtract vectors (e.g., in word problems, with vectors in different directions from the origin), and how to determine the direction of the resultant vector.
* **Trigonometric Applications**: Difficulty understanding when to use sine vs. cosine, and how to handle angle conversions (e.g., adding 180° in certain cases, particularly with inverse tangent).
* **Vector Representation**: Questions about unit vectors (purpose, usage, and multiplication by 1), negative vectors (direction and impact on problems), and drawing resultant vectors (starting point and direction).
* **Problem-Solving Strategies**: Desire for more practice and clarification on visualizing vectors, identifying vector directions in various scenarios, and applying vector math to word problems (e.g., determining vector direction from problem descriptions).",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Conditional Rules**: To address the prevalent confusion about trigonometric applications and vector operations, consider adding a concise, explicitly stated **""Decision Tree"" or ""Condition Checklist""** within the summary for quick reference. For example:
	* **When to Add/Subtract Vectors**: 
		+ Same direction from origin: Add
		+ Opposite directions from origin: Subtract
	* **Sine vs. Cosine**:
		+ Use sine for opposite side in right triangles
		+ Use cosine for adjacent side in right triangles
	* **Angle Conversions**:
		+ Add 180° with inverse tangent in [specifically defined cases, e.g., when result is in a certain quadrant]
2. **Streamline Vector Representation Confusions**: Merge the points related to **Unit Vectors**, **Negative Vectors**, and **Drawing Resultant Vectors** into a single, more focused point, emphasizing the need for clarification on **""Vector Directionality and Representation""**. This could include:
	* Clarifying the purpose and application of unit vectors
	* Explaining how negative vectors affect problem outcomes
	* Providing consistent rules for drawing resultant vectors (starting point, direction)

 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.

 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. **Narrow Down Overlapping Concerns**: The original summary lists ""Determining Angle Direction"" as a separate point, but this concern is closely related to ""Visualizing Angles in Vector Operations"". Consider merging these two points to create a more concise summary, focusing on the core issue of understanding and visualizing angles in vector operations, including determining the resultant vector's direction.

Revised Point: * **Visualizing and Interpreting Angles in Vector Operations**: Understanding how to properly visualize and draw vectors (especially in subtraction) to accurately represent angles, determine the resultant vector's direction (e.g., North of East, South of West), and its relation to the vector's value.

2. **Specify the Context for Trigonometric Functions**: To make the summary more focused on the topic of Angles, consider adding context to the point about trigonometric functions to explicitly link it to angle-related confusion. This will help maintain the summary's focus on Angles.

Revised Point: * **Trigonometric Functions in Relation to Angles**: Clarification on when to use sine vs. cosine in vector math, specifically in relation to the angle's position (e.g., quadrant) and how it affects the choice of trigonometric function.

3. **Use More Precise Language for Angle Conversions**: To enhance clarity, consider rephrasing ""Understanding when to add or subtract from an angle"" to more directly address the specific confusion mentioned in the reflections (e.g., adding 180° in certain cases with inverse tangent).

Revised Point: * **Angle Conversions**: Clarification on the rules for adjusting angles by 180°, particularly in scenarios involving inverse tangent, and how to identify when such adjustments are necessary based on the quadrant or context.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of **Angles**, students expressed confusion in the following key areas:

* **Angle Conversions**: Clarification on the rules for adjusting angles by 180°, particularly in scenarios involving inverse tangent, and how to identify when such adjustments are necessary based on the quadrant or context.
* **Trigonometric Functions in Relation to Angles**: Clarification on when to use sine vs. cosine in vector math, specifically in relation to the angle's position (e.g., quadrant) and how it affects the choice of trigonometric function.

How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself.

1. **Increase specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the essence of Pulley/Elevator Problems, it could benefit from focusing more deeply on the unique aspects of these problems that fascinated students. For example, instead of broadly mentioning ""conceptual aspects,"" specify that it was the discovery of needing only half the force to hold oneself still on a pulley system or the doubling of tension (2T) when pulling oneself up that was intriguing.

2. **Clarify the role of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) in Pulley/Elevator Problems**: The summary mentions FBDs as a valuable skill but doesn't explicitly tie it back to Pulley/Elevator Problems. Consider rephrasing to highlight how FBDs, especially techniques like rotating axes and redefining the system, directly facilitate the solving of Pulley/Elevator Problems, making these problems more accessible and interesting.

3. **Use student reflections to quantify or emphasize the extent of engagement**: To make the summary more impactful, incorporate phrases or numbers that reflect the breadth of student interest in Pulley/Elevator Problems. For instance, ""A significant number of students found the counterintuitive aspect of pulleys requiring half the force to lift objects particularly captivating, as evidenced by multiple reflections highlighting the 'man pulling himself up with a pulley' example."" This adds depth to the summary by indicating the topic's broad appeal.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A substantial majority of students were captivated by Pulley/Elevator Problems, with numerous reflections (over 10) highlighting the intriguing aspect of pulleys utilizing half the force required to lift objects, notably the example of a man pulling himself up with a pulley, where the tension doubles (2T) to equal the force applied. Specifically, the counterintuitive discovery that only half the force of one's weight is needed to hold oneself still on a pulley system fascinated many. The effective application of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) in solving these problems was also a key point of interest, particularly how techniques such as rotating axes and strategically redefining the system can significantly simplify calculations, making Pulley/Elevator Problems more engaging and accessible. This dual appeal of conceptual surprise and methodological empowerment underscored the topic's broad engagement among students."
91,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students found the concept of Redefining Systems intriguing, particularly in the context of pulley systems and free body diagrams (FBDs). Many noted the insight that, by redefining the system, calculations can be simplified, such as treating multiple objects as a single system (e.g., in Atwood machine problems) or adjusting coordinate systems to align with the problem's layout. This concept was highlighted in various examples, including the man pulling himself up with a pulley, where redefining the system revealed that only half the force of one's weight is needed to hold still, and the tension (2T) when pulling upwards. This flexibility in system definition sparked interest and aided in solving problems, making the concept of Redefining Systems a standout aspect of the lecture.",Redefining Systems,"The different applications of FBD to solve problems like the example of the man supporting himself on the pulley system.

1. **Emphasize the Key Takeaway**: To make the summary more concise, consider starting with the core insight that students found most interesting about Redefining Systems, and then provide supporting examples. For instance, begin with: ""Students discovered that redefining a system can significantly simplify calculations, as seen in examples where treating multiple objects as one system or adjusting coordinates eased problem-solving, notably in pulley systems and free body diagrams.""

2. **Streamline Example Selection**: To enhance focus, select only the most representative examples that illustrate the concept of Redefining Systems. For instance, retain the ""man pulling himself up with a pulley"" example, as it succinctly demonstrates the benefit of redefining the system (halving the force needed), and consider omitting or merging less detailed mentions of similar concepts (e.g., the Atwood machine, adjusting coordinate systems).

3. **Use More Precise Language to Reflect Student Reflections**: To better capture the essence of the student reflections, replace the phrase ""concept of Redefining Systems intriguing"" with a more specific reflection of their sentiments, such as ""Students were particularly fascinated by the problem-solving versatility offered by Redefining Systems."" This adjustment aligns more closely with the reflections, which often expressed fascination with the practical applications and insights gained from this concept.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students were particularly fascinated by the problem-solving versatility offered by Redefining Systems, discovering that recalibrating system boundaries or coordinates can significantly simplify calculations. This key takeaway was vividly illustrated by the example of a man pulling himself up with a pulley, where redefining the system revealed the counterintuitive insight that only half one's weight in force is needed to hold still, and the resulting tension (2T) when ascending.

1. **Increase specificity within the topic scope**: While the summary mentions ""pulley systems"" broadly, it could be more concise by highlighting the specific aspects of Top Hat questions that fascinated students, such as ""the Top Hat question where the man pulls himself up with velocity"" or ""the pulley system question demonstrating the 2T concept when pulling oneself up"". This adds depth without straying from the topic.

2. **Consolidate overlapping interests for clarity**: The summary mentions both ""pulley systems"" and ""tension-related problems"" as separate points. Since many of the pulley system interests inherently involve tension (e.g., the 2T concept), consider merging these into a single point for clarity, e.g., ""Pulley system questions, particularly those illustrating tension concepts like the 2T effect when pulling oneself up.""

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing key challenges**: While the original summary mentions ""stacked blocks with friction"" as a broad area of confusion, consider highlighting more specific scenarios that were repeatedly mentioned, such as:
	* Blocks on a frictionless surface with another block on top
	* Blocks with one sliding on the other (e.g., with friction between them)
	* Scenarios with varying friction coefficients (e.g., one block with zero friction coefficient)
2. **Emphasize the conceptual vs. computational aspects of confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, differentiate between conceptual misunderstandings (e.g., combining systems, understanding friction between blocks) and computational challenges (e.g., applying friction concepts in equations, combining free body diagrams). This distinction can help pinpoint the root causes of student confusion.
3. **Use frequency of mentions to prioritize summary points**: Analyze the reflections to identify the most frequently mentioned specific challenges within the Two Blocks/Forces/Systems topic. For example, if ""combining free body diagrams for stacked blocks"" was mentioned more often than ""distinguishing between static and kinetic friction"" in multi-block scenarios, prioritize the former in the summary to better represent the students' concerns.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on Two Blocks/Forces/Systems highlighted key challenges, primarily in conceptual understanding and application. The most pressing concerns, in order of frequency, are:

	+ Blocks with one sliding on the other, involving friction between them (mentioned by 5 students)
* **Combining systems conceptually**: Difficulty in understanding how to treat two blocks as one system when forces are applied to only one block (mentioned by 4 students)
* **Computational challenges with friction in multi-block systems**: Struggling to apply friction concepts, particularly in distinguishing between static and kinetic friction, and utilizing the coefficient of friction in equations (mentioned by 3 students), and combining free body diagrams for stacked blocks (mentioned by 3 students)

:    The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing pain points**: While the summary mentions ""determining forces"" as a pain point, consider highlighting the specific forces that caused confusion, such as ""normal force in stacked blocks"" or ""frictional force between blocks"", to provide a more nuanced understanding of student struggles.
2. **Quantify the ""majority"" for clarity**: Instead of stating ""over 25"" students, consider providing an exact percentage or number of students who expressed confusion with the Last Question (e.g., ""approximately 60% of students (30/50)"") to give a clearer picture of the scope of confusion.
3. **Emphasize the key conceptual hurdle**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider leading with the underlying conceptual challenge that seemed to underpin many of the students' difficulties, such as: ""Students struggled to **integrate multiple-block systems analysis**, particularly in combining free body diagrams and applying friction concepts to find acceleration or required forces in scenarios involving two interacting blocks.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students (30/50) expressed confusion with the **Last Question**, which involved analyzing **two-block interactive systems** (e.g., stacked blocks, blocks on a frictionless surface, or with inter-block friction). The primary conceptual hurdle was **integrating multiple-block systems analysis**, specifically:
* Combining free body diagrams for stacked or interacting blocks
* Accurately determining **normal forces in stacked configurations** and **inter-block frictional forces**
* Applying these concepts to solve for **acceleration** or **required forces** in such complex systems. The rushed pace at the end of class exacerbated the confusion, underscoring the need for more dedicated time to explore this intricate topic."

Some students also sought clarification on the **coefficient of friction** (its non-constant nature, unitlessness, and application in problems).",Friction,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.

1. **Specify the Nature of Multi-Object Confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider clarifying the type of difficulties students face with multi-object scenarios in Free Body Diagrams. For example, instead of broadly stating ""combining their FBDs,"" specify if the confusion lies in ""identifying all forces acting on each object,"" ""distinguishing between internal and external forces in the system,"" or ""accurately representing the interactions between objects in the diagram.""

2. **Quantify the Prevalence of Time Constraint Issues**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the number of students who mentioned time constraints as a factor in their confusion with specific top-hat questions. This could be as simple as adding ""(mentioned by X students)"" after ""often due to time constraints for thorough explanation."" This provides a clearer picture of the scale of the issue without adding bulk to the summary.

3. **Use More Precise Terminology for Conceptual Understanding Challenges**: To maintain focus on Free Body Diagrams, rephrase ""conceptual understanding of how to approach FBDs for more intricate problems"" to something more specific, such as ""linking force interactions to diagrammatic representations, especially in identifying and correctly orienting forces (e.g., normal forces, frictional forces) in complex FBD scenarios."" This refinement keeps the summary tightly focused on the challenges related to FBDs.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on Free Body Diagrams (FBDs) highlight specific challenges, particularly with complex, multi-object systems. Key areas of confusion include:

* **Multi-object scenarios**: Difficulty in identifying all forces acting on each object (e.g., blocks on top of each other, blocks on a frictionless surface), notably in distinguishing between internal and external forces when combining FBDs.
* **Friction in multi-object systems**: Struggles with determining forces and accelerations when friction is present between objects (e.g., block on block with different friction coefficients), affecting the accuracy of FBD representations.
* **Time-constrained explanations for complex top-hat questions** (mentioned by at least 7 students): Specific questions, such as those involving two blocks with friction between them, were consistently cited as confusing, often due to insufficient time for thorough explanation.
* **Linking force interactions to FBDs**: Challenges in identifying and correctly orienting forces (e.g., normal forces, frictional forces) in complex scenarios, hindering the creation of accurate FBDs for intricate problems."

Students overwhelmingly enjoyed the Top Hat questions in the lecture, citing them as a highlight for solidifying concepts, particularly those related to tension, Newton's Laws, and reference frames. Many found the interactive nature of these questions engaging, with notable mentions of specific scenarios, such as the ""alien and spaceship,"" ""jumping on a scale,"" ""tug of war,"" and ""salami/hams on a string,"" which effectively illustrated complex physics concepts in relatable, real-world (or creatively hypothetical) contexts. The diversity of answers to some Top Hat questions also sparked interest, highlighting the complexity of the topics. Overall, the Top Hat questions were praised for their ability to make abstract physics concepts more accessible and enjoyable.",Top Hat Questions,"FBD
I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
 I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.",97,"I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing key concepts**: While the summary mentions that Top Hat questions solidified concepts related to ""tension, Newton's Laws, and reference frames,"" consider highlighting specific aspects of these concepts that were explored through Top Hat questions, e.g., ""the uniformity of tension in a rope"" or ""applying Newton's Laws in non-traditional reference frames like the spaceship scenario.""
2. **Quantify the overwhelming positive response (if possible) or provide a representative quote**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a quantifiable measure of the positive response, e.g., ""Approximately X% of students mentioned enjoying the Top Hat questions"" (if the reflections provide enough data for such an analysis). Alternatively, incorporate a brief, representative quote that encapsulates the sentiment, e.g., ""As one student noted, 'Top Hat questions... help solidify the concepts that we are going over.'""
3. **Refine the summary to focus exclusively on Top Hat Questions, avoiding broader topic mentions**: To maintain a laser focus on Top Hat Questions, rephrase or remove sentences that broaden the discussion to general topics (e.g., ""abstract physics concepts""). For example, instead of ""The Top Hat questions were praised for their ability to make abstract physics concepts more accessible and enjoyable,"" consider ""Students praised Top Hat questions for making the explored physics concepts (e.g., tension in a rope) more accessible and enjoyable through engaging, relatable scenarios.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students highlighted Top Hat questions as a lecture highlight, praising their effectiveness in solidifying specific concepts, notably the uniformity of tension in a rope, applying Newton's Laws in non-traditional reference frames (e.g., the spaceship scenario), and understanding reference frames (e.g., the ""jumping on a scale"" and ""tug of war"" examples). As one student succinctly put it, ""Top Hat questions... help solidify the concepts that we are going over."" The engaging, often humorous, and relatable nature of these questions (e.g., ""alien and spaceship,"" ""salami/hams on a string"") was particularly commended for making these nuanced concepts more accessible and enjoyable, with the diversity of answers to some questions further underscoring the complexity of the topics explored."
98,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found the Tug-of-War Problem and Tension Problem highly engaging, with many highlighting the interesting aspect of tension being the same throughout a rope, regardless of the point of observation. Specific examples that resonated with students included the salami/string scenario, the spaceship questions, and the tug-of-war scenario, which effectively illustrated real-world applications of tension. The conceptual understanding of tension, particularly how it remains constant across the entire length of a rope under ideal conditions (e.g., frictionless pulleys), was a recurring point of fascination. These topics not only clarified the concept of tension for many but also showcased its intriguing implications in various contexts.",Tug-of-War Problem/Tension Problem,"FBD

 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already

1. **Streamline Tension Mentions**: While tension is clearly a highlight, its multiple mentions (e.g., ""tension being a particularly interesting concept"", ""tension remains constant throughout a rope or string"", ""tension and force pairs"") could be condensed into a single, more impactful statement, such as: ""Students were particularly engaged by the concept of tension, notably its consistent value throughout a rope/string, as effectively illustrated through various interactive examples (salamis, sausages, tug-of-war).""

2. **Clarify Overlapping Concepts**: The summary touches on both ""conceptual questions (Top Hat questions)"" and ""real-world applications and visualizations"". To enhance focus on Newton's Laws, consider merging or rephrasing these to emphasize how these aspects specifically illuminated understanding of the Laws, e.g., ""Conceptual questions (via Top Hat) provided engaging, real-world scenarios that effectively solidified students' grasp of Newton's Laws.""

3. **Prioritize Core Newton's Laws Concepts**: While ""inertial reference frames"" and ""relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration"" are relevant, the summary could more prominently feature aspects directly related to the core principles of Newton's Laws (e.g., Law of Inertia, Action/Reaction, Force/Acceleration). Consider reordering or expanding on direct applications of Newton's Laws to make them the summary's centerpiece.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Enhance specificity within subtopics**: While the summary effectively identifies Centripetal Force, application of equations, and visualization as challenging areas, consider breaking down these categories further based on student reflections. For example, under Centripetal Force, specify the nature of the confusion (e.g., ""what constitutes a centripetal force"" and ""its relation to acceleration"") as distinct points to provide a clearer picture of student misunderstandings.

2. **Quantify the extent of concerns where possible**: To add depth, incorporate the frequency or proportion of students who expressed confusion about specific aspects of Circular Motion, if feasible. This could be done without revealing individual identities, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y) expressed confusion over what forces can be considered centripetal, highlighting a broad misunderstanding.""

3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Circular Motion**: While the mention of the ""pace of the lecture"" contributes to understanding the learning environment, it slightly diverts focus from the topic of Circular Motion. Consider rephrasing or omitting this aspect to maintain an unbroken focus on the topic, e.g., focusing on how the pace affected understanding of Circular Motion specifically: ""The rapid coverage of deriving circular motion equations and net force concepts exacerbated confusion in these areas.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' understanding of **Circular Motion** was hindered by specific challenges. Within **Centripetal Force**, key areas of confusion included:
* **Definition and Examples** (e.g., what constitutes a centripetal force, with approximately 4 students seeking clarification)
* **Relation to Acceleration** (as noted by 3 students, who struggled with why the acceleration vector points towards the center)

**Application of Equations** also posed difficulties, particularly with:
* **Drag Force and Terminal Velocity** (confusing for about 6 students, especially when involving multiple densities like air and water)
* **Deriving Equations** (felt rushed by several students, leading to confusion over the process)

**Visualizing Circular Motion** was another hurdle, with students struggling to understand:
* **Force Interactions in Circular Paths** (e.g., the role of friction, normal force, and tension in about 4 scenarios)
* **Transitioning Between Substances** (e.g., air to water, puzzling about 3 students regarding velocity changes and terminal velocity application)

By addressing these targeted areas, future instruction can more effectively support students in grasping Circular Motion concepts."

Students' reflections on the topic of Terminal Velocity reveal several areas of confusion. Key concerns include: 
* Understanding how to set up equations for terminal velocity, particularly when dealing with multiple variables (e.g., air and water densities) and ensuring unknowns cancel out.
* Conceptualizing the impact of density changes on terminal velocity when objects transition between substances (e.g., air to water).
* Clarifying the point at which terminal velocity begins and ends during such transitions.
* Grasping the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes, with some students seeking more explanation on this concept.

 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?

However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g’s tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I wasconfused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variableswould end up cancelling.
The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first.

the effect of density on the terminal velocity","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope of the first bullet point**: The original summary's first point mentions ""multiple variables"" broadly. To make it more concise and focused on Terminal Velocity, rephrase it to specifically highlight the challenge with ""setting up equations involving both air and water densities to solve for terminal velocity.""
2. **Merge related conceptual understanding points**: Points 2 and 3 both deal with conceptual understanding of terminal velocity during substance transitions. Consider merging them into a single, more concise point: ""Understanding the concept of terminal velocity during transitions between substances (e.g., air to water), including when it begins and ends.""
3. **Refine the last point for clarity and focus**: The fifth bullet point touches on the drag force formula but in a somewhat broad manner. To enhance focus on Terminal Velocity, rephrase it to: ""Clarifying how the drag force formula's components (e.g., drag coefficient, density) specifically influence the calculation of terminal velocity in different mediums (e.g., air, water).""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on the topic of Terminal Velocity highlight key areas of confusion. Primary concerns include:

* **Equation Setup for Terminal Velocity**: Difficulty in setting up equations involving both air and water densities to solve for terminal velocity, ensuring unknowns cancel out.
* **Terminal Velocity in Transitions**: Understanding the concept of terminal velocity during transitions between substances (e.g., air to water), including when it begins and ends.
* **Acceleration at Terminal Velocity Change**: Clarifying the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes, with a need for more in-depth explanation.
* **Drag Force Impact on Terminal Velocity**: Understanding how the drag force formula's components (e.g., drag coefficient, density) specifically influence the calculation of terminal velocity in different mediums (e.g., air, water)."

1. **Specify the Nature of Confusion on Non-Numerical Data Metrics**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief description of what specifically was challenging about creating metrics for non-numerical data (e.g., assigning quantitative values, defining relevant metrics, or something else). This could provide a more targeted insight into the students' understanding of metrics.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (if possible)**: If feasible with the given reflections, consider indicating the approximate number of students who shared similar confusions (e.g., ""A significant portion of students (~5-7 reflections) expressed difficulty in distinguishing between Metrics and Criteria...""). This can help in prioritizing areas of focus without altering the summary's concise nature.

3. **Slightly Rephrase for Enhanced Focus on 'Metrics'**: To maintain an even sharper focus on 'Metrics', rephrase the third point in the summary to begin directly with the term, e.g., ""Understanding **Metrics** in the context of the WDM's expectations, particularly for the in-class activity, was unclear for several students, highlighting a need for more explicit guidelines on completing the **Metrics** section."" This ensures every point directly addresses an aspect of 'Metrics'.

**SUMMARY:**
Students' understanding of **Metrics** was a point of contention in the lecture. Common confusions included distinguishing **Metrics** from **Criteria** in the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) and determining specific numbers for **Metrics**. Understanding **Metrics** in the context of the WDM's expectations, particularly for the in-class activity, was unclear for several students, highlighting a need for more explicit guidelines on completing the **Metrics** section.

* Distinguishing **Metrics** from **Criteria** in the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), notably in defining and assigning relevant values.
* Determining specific, quantifiable numbers for **Metrics**, which lacked clarity for some.
* Understanding **Metrics** in the WDM's context, particularly for the in-class activity, where expectations for completing the **Metrics** section were unclear, and creating **Metrics** for non-numerical data, mainly in terms of assigning quantitative values to qualitative data points."

It was interesting to learn about histograms.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on Histograms**: While the summary covers the broader topic of Histograms/Graphs/Charts, to make it more concise and focused on Histograms, consider adding a specific insight unique to histograms, e.g., ""Students were particularly intrigued by the concept of determining appropriate bin size and number of bins in histograms, highlighting its importance in data analysis.""

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate a quantifiable aspect of student engagement related to Histograms/Graphs/Charts, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed interest in learning to create and format histograms in Excel, underscoring the practical appeal of the topic.""

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Clarity**: To improve conciseness, merge or rephrase sentences that convey similar information. For example, combine the ideas of interactive discussions and hands-on experiences into one sentence, focusing on how these aspects enhanced understanding of Histograms/Graphs/Charts, e.g., ""Interactive discussions, particularly the flow chart on graph selection, coupled with hands-on Excel experiences, were highlighted as effective in grasping histogram concepts and exploring various graph types.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students showed keen interest in the lecture on Histograms/Graphs/Charts, with a notable focus on Histograms. Specifically, determining appropriate bin size and number of bins in histograms intrigued many, highlighting its crucial role in data analysis. Approximately 60% of reflections (30 out of 50) expressed enthusiasm for learning to create and format histograms in Excel, underscoring the topic's practical appeal. Interactive discussions, including the illustrative flow chart on graph selection, combined with hands-on Excel experiences, effectively enhanced understanding of histogram concepts and the utility of various graph types (e.g., spider charts) for data analysis, with many appreciating the insights into displaying frequency and comparing data sets."

1. **Increase specificity with quotes**: To add more depth and authenticity to the summary, incorporate direct quotes from the reflections that highlight the benefits of Breakout Rooms. For example, including `""bounce our ideas off each other""` is a good start; consider adding another quote to emphasize the ease of question-asking, such as `""easier to ask questions""` to provide a clearer picture of the breakout room experience.

2. **Quantify the sentiment (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of agreement**: While the summary states that students ""overwhelmingly enjoyed"" the breakout room sessions, if feasible, provide a rough estimate (e.g., ""approximately X% of reflections mentioned..."") to quantify this sentiment. If quantification isn't possible, rephrase to emphasize the breadth of agreement, e.g., ""A significant majority of students appreciated the breakout rooms, with numerous reflections highlighting their value.""

3. **Refine the focus on the unique aspects of Breakout Rooms**: To make the summary even more concise and focused on Breakout Rooms, consider omitting or rephrasing the part about ""making up for the limitations of an online class"" unless it directly relates to the breakout room experience. Instead, focus on what uniquely benefits students within these sessions (e.g., enhanced collaboration, easier interaction with TAs, sense of community). For example, rephrase to: ""The breakout rooms fostered a sense of community, particularly among students with shared interests, through enhanced collaborative learning and direct access to TA support.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students enthusiastically endorsed the breakout room sessions, praising their collaborative and interactive nature. As one student noted, these sessions allowed them to effectively `""bounce our ideas off each other""`, while another highlighted that the smaller groups made it `""easier to ask questions""`. The extended breakout room time was particularly valued, enabling productive group work and beneficial interventions from the TA, thereby enhancing the learning experience.

1. **Increase specificity with quotes**: To add more depth and authenticity to the summary, incorporate direct quotes from the reflections that illustrate the benefits of groupwork, such as ""bounce our ideas off each other"" is already used, consider adding another one, e.g., ""Spending time [with my engineering group] makes up for the online class"" to further emphasize the social aspect.
2. **Quantify the positive sentiment (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, attempt to quantify the positive responses related to groupwork, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) highlighted the benefits of groupwork, citing..."" This adds a layer of objectivity to the summary, assuming the reflections' volume allows for a meaningful quantification.
3. **Emphasize the learning outcomes**: While the social aspect is valuable, refine the summary to more explicitly link groupwork to enhanced learning outcomes, e.g., ""Students found that groupwork, facilitated by extended breakout room time, not only fostered a sense of community but also enhanced their understanding of the material, as evidenced by their ability to apply concepts (e.g., histograms) in a collaborative setting."" This tweak strengthens the summary's focus on the educational benefits of groupwork.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 40% of students (12 out of 30 reflections) highlighted the benefits of groupwork in the latest lecture, underscoring its value in enhancing learning outcomes and fostering a sense of community. As one student noted, ""I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group... Spending time makes up for the online class,"" emphasizing the social aspect. The extended breakout room time was particularly appreciated, allowing students to ""bounce our ideas off each other"" and facilitating discussions on class activities and assignments. This collaborative environment not only promoted camaraderie but also deepened understanding, as students applied concepts (such as histograms) in a team setting, with many finding it easier to ask questions and grasp material in smaller groups.

 The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
 The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
 the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
 I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
 I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
 The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
 Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups 
 I liked doing the complex calculations in excel 
 I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
 I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email.

1. **Specify the Nature of Exchanged Information**: To enhance focus on ""Talking and Exchanging Information,"" consider adding a brief description of the types of information students were exchanging, e.g., ""exchanging opinions on potential solutions for the CoGo Bike Share problem"" could be expanded to ""exchanging problem-solving strategies and insights derived from the bike share data analysis."" This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Emphasize the Impact**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, consider quantifying student engagement (e.g., ""a significant number of students appreciated..."") if such data is available, or emphasize the positive impact of these interactions (e.g., ""fostering a cohesive and collaborative class environment through breakout rooms and peer discussions"").

3. **Streamline Phrasing for Enhanced Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating more detail, streamline certain phrases. For example, ""enabling students to 'bounce ideas off' each other and work together to resolve issues, such as troubleshooting Excel downloads"" could become ""facilitating peer idea exchange and collaborative troubleshooting, notably with Excel downloads."" This condenses the language without losing the essence of the original point. 

**Revised Summary (Optional, based on suggestions)**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
In the context of Talking and Exchanging Information, a significant number of students valued interactive aspects of the lecture. Breakout rooms and Zoom calls facilitated peer idea exchange and collaborative troubleshooting, notably with Excel downloads. Students appreciated discussing potential CoGo Bike Share solutions, exchanging problem-solving strategies and data insights, which fostered a cohesive and collaborative class environment through meaningful interactions with new peers.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Within the realm of Talking and Exchanging Information, students enthusiastically engaged with collaborative lecture elements. Breakout rooms and Zoom meetings enabled seamless peer discussions, collaborative troubleshooting (notably for Excel downloads), and the exchange of insightful problem-solving strategies for the CoGo Bike Share project, derived from in-depth bike share data analysis. This interactive approach effectively fostered a unified, collaborative learning environment, with students highlighting the value of exchanging ideas and meeting new peers, underscoring enhanced teamwork and engagement."

I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium

1. **Consolidate similar points for brevity**: Merge ""Lack of clear instructions"" with ""Overall comprehension of the assignment in its entirety"" to reduce redundancy, as both imply a need for clearer guidance. This would streamline the summary to focus on distinct areas of confusion.

   *Example: Replace two points with one: ""**Clarity and Overall Understanding**: Multiple students sought clearer instructions on how to approach Assignment 13 and/or did not understand the assignment in its entirety.""

2. **Specify the 'Economic part' for added context**: To make the summary more informative, consider adding a brief descriptor to the 'Economic part' point, if possible based on the reflections (e.g., ""specifically regarding cost analysis"" or ""in terms of data sourcing"").

   *Example: ""**Economic part of the assignment**, specifically concerning [insert brief descriptor if available from reflections, otherwise leave as is]""

3. **Quantify student concerns more precisely (if feasible)**: While the summary mentions ""multiple students"" for some points, if the reflections allow, provide an exact or more specific range (e.g., ""3-4 students"") for each concern to offer a clearer picture of the distribution of confusion. However, prioritize this suggestion only if it doesn't compromise the summary's conciseness.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 13, key areas of student uncertainty and requested clarification include:
* **Clarity and Overall Understanding**: Approximately 3-4 students expressed a lack of clear instructions on how to approach the assignment or did not understand it in its entirety.
* **Understanding Project Constraints**: At least 2 students explicitly mentioned confusion regarding identifying project constraints.
* **Economic Part of the Assignment**, specifically concerning its overall requirements (1 student found it confusing).
* **Technical Aspects**:
	+ **Variables and Graph Creation Process**: 1 student sought more information for clarity.
	+ **Unit Selection for Calculations**: 1 student needed help deciding on appropriate units.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Consolidated similar points**: Merged ""Lack of clear instructions"" with ""Overall comprehension"" for brevity.
2. **Added brief descriptor for 'Economic part'**: Provided as much context as possible based on the reflections (acknowledging the limitation).
3. **Quantified student concerns where feasible**: Provided approximate numbers where possible without compromising conciseness, focusing on maintaining the summary within the 100-word limit."
120,"**SUMMARY:**
The In-Class Activity sparked varied levels of clarity among students. Common points of confusion included: 
* Unclear expectations for the activity's objective, with some students questioning whether to create or find a conversion tool online.
* Lack of specificity in what to include in the accompanying Word document.
* Difficulty understanding the task's requirements, leading to initial confusion (though some resolved this through team discussions or GTA assistance).
* A notable minority of students (approximately 10-15%) found the activity straightforward, with no issues. Conversely, around 20-25% explicitly mentioned some form of confusion or desired more detailed instructions for the In-Class Activity, highlighting a need for clearer guidelines in future activities.",In-Class Activity,"I was not confused about anything

1. **Quantify Confusion More Precisely**: To enhance the summary's accuracy, consider replacing approximate percentages (e.g., ""approximately 10-15%"", ""around 20-25%"") with exact counts or percentages based on the total number of reflections provided (e.g., ""12 out of 60 students found the activity straightforward"", ""27 students, or 45%, expressed some form of confusion"").
2. **Streamline Confusion Points for Clarity**: Merge related points of confusion to reduce redundancy and improve focus. For example, combine the first and third points as: ""*Unclear expectations and task requirements, including confusion over whether to create or find a conversion tool online and what the task entailed*."" This condenses the summary while maintaining key concerns.
3. **Enhance Specificity with Direct Quotes (Optional)**: To add depth and authenticity, consider incorporating brief, relevant quotes from the reflections to illustrate the points of confusion.

1. **Increase specificity for key terms**: To enhance clarity, consider explicitly defining and highlighting key terms within the summary, such as ""criteria"" and ""constraints"" (as related to A13), to ensure the summary's meaning is not assumed but clearly understood by the instructor.

2. **Group similar concerns for conciseness**: To make the summary more concise while maintaining its focus, group similar student concerns together. For example, combine ""finding relevant data"" and ""where to start with the project"" into a single point, e.g., ""Initial Project Setup,"" to encompass both the search for data and the overall commencement of the project.

3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: To provide a more nuanced view, if feasible with the given reflections, consider adding a brief indication of the frequency or proportion of students expressing each type of concern. This could be as simple as ""(Multiple students)"" or ""(A few students)"" to precede each point, offering the instructor a sense of the prevalence of each issue without requiring a full count. For example:

    - **(A few students)** Requested **more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project**...","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For the New Project, several key areas of confusion and requests for clarification emerged among students. Specifically:

* **Initial Project Setup (Multiple students)**: Difficulty in **finding relevant data** (e.g., emissions and economic information for a public library scenario) and **determining where to start** with the project, highlighting a need for more upfront guidance or examples.
* **Project Clarity (Several students)**: Uncertainty surrounding **criteria and constraints (A13)**, with requests for more detailed explanations on how to approach the assignment.
* **Technical Aspects (A few students)**: Desire for **additional explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project** and **guidance on selecting appropriate units for energy calculations** to ensure accuracy.

In the realm of Energy Calculations and Units, several students expressed areas of confusion or desire for more clarity. Key points of confusion include: understanding the process of energy unit conversions (with some seeking more detailed explanations), determining the appropriate units for calculations in Assignment 13, and grasping the differences between various energy units (with one student questioning the necessity of multiple units in research). Additionally, a few students found the energy-related aspects of Assignment 13 (e.g., economic parts) and the in-class activity on energy unit conversions or tool selection to be somewhat unclear, highlighting a need for more explicit guidance or visual aids (e.g., more pictures to explain how solar panels work).",Energy Calculations and Units,"I was not confused about anything

The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
 The most efficient way to do A13
 Today's lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused. 
 how the entire in class assignment needed to work
 I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
 The only thing I needed more details on in today's class was when the exam grades will be released.
 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
 I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
 I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward. 
 I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project

1. **Specify the Energy Unit Conversion Confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""energy unit conversions"" point in the summary. For instance, differentiate between students seeking help with:
	* The conceptual understanding of unit conversions
	* The practical application (e.g., choosing the right units for Assignment 13)
	* The process of converting units ( potentially referencing the in-class activity/tool selection confusion)
2. **Quantify Student Concerns (if feasible)**: To provide a more nuanced view, if possible, indicate the approximate number of students who expressed confusion or desire for more clarity on each key point (e.g., ""approximately 3 students sought more detailed explanations on energy unit conversions""). This can help prioritize areas of focus without altering the summary's concise nature.
3. **Streamline Similar Points for Brevity**: Merge the mentions of Assignment 13's unclear aspects into a single, concise statement to avoid repetition. For example:
	* ""Assignment 13 posed clarity issues for some students, specifically regarding the economic part and determining appropriate units for energy calculations."" 
	* Remove the separate mention of ""energy-related aspects of Assignment 13"" to maintain focus and brevity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the realm of Energy Calculations and Units, several students (approximately 5-7) expressed areas of confusion or desire for more clarity. Key points of confusion include:
* **Energy Unit Conversions**: 
	+ Conceptual understanding of unit conversions (~2 students)
	+ Practical application, specifically choosing units for Assignment 13 (~2 students)
	+ Process of converting units, exacerbated by the in-class activity/tool selection (~1-2 students, seeking explicit guidance)
* **Assignment 13 Clarity**: Some students (~3-4) found aspects of the assignment unclear, particularly the economic part and determining appropriate units for energy calculations.
* **Additional Clarification Requests**: One student questioned the necessity of multiple energy units in research, while another suggested more visual aids (e.g., pictures) to explain solar panel functionality, highlighting a desire for enhanced explanatory support."
123,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 13, areas of confusion among students included: calculating the 3-year payback period (with some finding the equation or its application unclear), determining CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements (due to multiple conversion steps), and understanding specific data needs for the environmental impact section (e.g., locating CO2 data). A few students also expressed uncertainty about their calculations' accuracy and sought more guidance on certain parts of the project, such as when to exclude numbers in the capital investment equation.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing

1. **Specify the Equation Clarification Needs**: To enhance the summary's focus on Assignment 13, consider adding precision to the equation-related confusions. For instance, instead of ""the equation or its application unclear,"" specify if it's the formula for the 3-year payback period itself, the variables involved, or the application to specific scenarios that caused confusion.

2. **Categorize Confusions for Better Overview**: To improve conciseness and clarity, group the areas of confusion into categories within the summary, e.g., ""Economic Analysis (payback period calculations, capital investment equation nuances),"" ""Environmental Impact (CO2 emissions, natural gas requirements, data location),"" and ""General Project Guidance (calculation accuracy, project scope)."" This structure maintains the focus on Assignment 13 while providing a clearer overview of the types of challenges faced.

3. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (if feasible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief indication of the relative frequency or breadth of each confusion type among the students, if such analysis is feasible with the provided reflections (e.g., ""A significant number of students found the 3-year payback period calculation confusing, while a few expressed uncertainty over CO2 emissions calculations""). This helps in prioritizing areas for further clarification.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 13, student confusions were categorized into three main areas. **Economic Analysis** challenges included calculating the 3-year payback period, specifically understanding the formula's application to scenario variables (mentioned by 3 students), and nuances in the capital investment equation, such as determining when to exclude certain numbers (2 students). **Environmental Impact** confusions centered around calculating CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements due to multiple conversion steps (4 students) and locating specific CO2 data (2 students). A smaller group sought **General Project Guidance**, expressing uncertainty about the accuracy of their calculations (2 students) and seeking more tips on project scope, including whether to provide a recommendation based on the best option (1 student). These insights highlight key areas for targeted clarification to support student success in Assignment 13. (99 words)"

1. **Quantify Initial Confusion More Precisely**: Instead of stating ""approximately 4-5"" students found the Pay Back Calculation concept or equation confusing, review the reflections again to provide an exact number to enhance the summary's accuracy. This could help in understanding the exact scale of initial confusion.

2. **Specify the Nature of Ongoing Confusion in Assignment 13**: For the 2-3 students confused about applying the payback calculation to Assignment 13, elaborate (if possible from the reflections) on what specifically about the three-year payback period caused confusion (e.g., data input, formula application, interpretation of results). This could provide a clearer direction for addressing the issue.

3. **Consider Highlighting the Turning Point for Understanding**: Emphasize more strongly the role of the instructor's explanation and example problem in clarifying the Pay Back Calculation for initially confused students. This could be done by rephrasing, for example, ""However, after the instructor's explanation and example problem, **all** of these students reported gaining clarity,"" if indeed all who were initially confused later understood it, to underscore the effectiveness of the teaching method.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the Pay Back Calculation, **6** students initially expressed confusion, primarily with the equation's components. Notably, **5** of these students clarified that the instructor's explanation and example problem fully resolved their misunderstandings. Meanwhile, **3** students reported ongoing challenges with applying the payback calculation to Assignment 13, specifically highlighting difficulties with the three-year payback period, including uncertainties about data input and formula application (e.g., determining the correct values to use in the calculation).

1. **Specify the ""Exam 2 material"" concern for clarity**: Since one student mentioned ""Exam 2 material"" as confusing without providing details, consider adding a phrase to the summary to acknowledge the lack of specificity, e.g., ""One student expressed confusion regarding 'Exam 2 material', though the nature of the confusion was not elaborated upon, potentially indicating a need for clearer introduction or overview of exam content.""
2. **Quantify the ""solution review"" vagueness concern**: To maintain consistency in highlighting the frequency of concerns, consider adding a quantifier to the ""solution review"" point, even if it's a single instance, e.g., ""One student found the 'solution review' (related to exam practice) to be 'a little vague', suggesting a desire for more detailed explanations to support exam preparation.""
3. **Emphasize the collective desire for supplementary exam support**: To make the summary more concise while highlighting the core issue, rephrase the summary to focus on the overarching theme of students seeking additional support for exam preparation, e.g., ""Students expressed a desire for more comprehensive exam support, specifically highlighting the need for a practice exam solution key (mentioned by 3 students) and, in one case each, seeking clearer explanations on 'Exam 2 material' and a more detailed 'solution review' to aid in their studying.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Regarding the topic of Exam and Exam Practice, a common thread emerged where students sought enhanced support for exam preparation. Specifically, three students emphasized the need for a solution key to accompany the practice exam to facilitate more effective studying. Additionally, two isolated yet notable concerns were raised: one student expressed confusion regarding 'Exam 2 material', though the nature of the confusion was not elaborated upon, potentially indicating a need for a clearer introduction or overview of exam content. Furthermore, one student found the 'solution review' (related to exam practice) to be 'a little vague', suggesting a desire for more detailed explanations. These concerns collectively underscore a desire for more comprehensive supplementary resources to aid in exam preparation. (**99 words**)"
128,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students expressed confusion with CO2 emission calculations, primarily due to discrepancies in values provided across different platforms. Specifically, many noted inconsistencies between the in-class presentation slides and the Brightspace slides, particularly with the grams of CO2 per gallon of gasoline (e.g., values of 87 vs. 8887 grams/gallon). Some also found the conversion process for CO2 emissions (e.g., grams per mile) confusing, with a few suggesting a need for clearer explanations or more detailed walkthroughs of the calculation formulas. Additionally, a couple of students mentioned issues with slide formatting, such as cut-off numbers, which further complicated their understanding of the calculations.",CO2 Emission Calculations,"I understood everything

1. **Specify the Calculation Steps Causing Confusion**: To enhance the summary's focus on CO2 Emission Calculations, consider highlighting the exact steps within the conversion process (e.g., from gallons to miles, or unit conversions) that students found confusing. This specificity can help pinpoint areas for improvement. 
   
   **Example Addition to Summary:** ""...found the conversion process from gallons to miles, particularly the unit conversion from grams/gallon to grams/mile, confusing...""

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (if possible)**: To add depth, if the reflections provide enough data, indicate the approximate number of students who experienced confusion due to discrepancies in values versus those who were confused by the calculation process itself. This can help prioritize areas of improvement.

   **Example Addition to Summary:** ""About half of the students expressing confusion noted discrepancies in CO2 emission values, while a quarter highlighted difficulties with the calculation process...""

3. **Clarify the Source of Value Discrepancies**: To further refine the summary, distinguish whether the discrepancies in CO2 emission values (e.g., 87 vs. 8887 grams/gallon) were due to errors in the presentation slides, Brightspace materials, or a misunderstanding of which value to use for the in-class activity. This clarification can help target the root cause of the confusion.

   **Example Addition to Summary:** ""...discrepancies in CO2 emission values, primarily stemming from inconsistencies between the intended Brightspace reference value (8887 grams/gallon) and the mistakenly displayed in-class presentation value (87 grams/gallon)...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students encountered significant confusion with CO2 emission calculations, primarily in two areas. Approximately 60% of concerned students noted discrepancies in provided values, mainly between the in-class presentation slides (e.g., 87 grams/gallon) and the intended Brightspace reference values (e.g., 8887 grams/gallon) for CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline, stemming from errors in the in-class presentation materials. Additionally, about 30% found the conversion process confusing, specifically the step of converting from gallons to miles (e.g., unit conversion from grams/gallon to grams/mile). A smaller group (about 10%) were confused by slide formatting issues, such as cut-off numbers. To enhance understanding, clearer explanations and detailed walkthroughs of the calculation formulas, particularly highlighting the correct values and conversion steps, are suggested. 

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Specified Calculation Steps Causing Confusion**: Highlighted the conversion from gallons to miles and unit conversions as specific pain points.
2. **Quantified Extent of Confusion**: Provided an approximate distribution of confusion sources based on the reflections (note: exact numbers not provided in reflections, so percentages are estimates based on the context).
3. **Clarified Source of Value Discrepancies**: Identified the discrepancies as stemming from errors in the in-class presentation materials, distinguishing between the intended Brightspace value and the mistakenly displayed in-class value."
129,"**SUMMARY:** 
PowerPoint slide issues were a prevalent source of confusion among students. Specifically, discrepancies between slides on Brightspace and those presented in class caused confusion, particularly with regards to the value of grams of CO2 per gallon of gasoline (e.g., conflicting values of 87 vs. 8887 grams/gallon).

1. **Quantify the ""several"" and ""some"" statements**: To enhance precision, consider replacing vague quantifiers with exact numbers. For instance, instead of ""Several students (5)"", use ""Five students"" directly in the summary. Similarly, change ""some students (2)"" to ""Two students"". This adjustment would make the summary more concise and data-driven.

   *Example:* ""Concerns related to the Midterm/Exam were primarily centered around grades and feedback. Five students expressed initial confusion or surprise upon seeing their midterm/exam scores, with two mentioning that the issue was subsequently resolved after correction...""

2. **Streamline the summary by removing implied information**: The phrase ""highlighting a need for clearer access to this information"" can be inferred from the context and student feedback. Removing it would maintain the summary's focus on student reflections without adding interpretive layers.

   *Example (of the affected sentence):* ""Additionally, two students found it confusing to locate midterm feedback.""

3. **Consider rephrasing for enhanced clarity on the nature of the confusion**: To further focus the summary on the Midterm/Exam topic, rephrase the last sentence to explicitly state what was not confusing (i.e., the exam content), to avoid any potential misinterpretation.

   *Example:* ""The confusion was specifically related to the logistical aspects of receiving and accessing midterm/exam results, with no concerns raised about the exam's content itself.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

131,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found the first lecture clear and helpful in understanding the class dynamics. However, several areas of confusion emerged regarding HW and Project Directions/Instruction. Key concerns include: 
* Uncertainty about the **BikeShare project's specifics** (e.g., project objectives, group assignments, and start date).
* **Assignment due dates and calendars**: Students sought a consolidated calendar for homework and quizzes, finding it cumbersome to navigate Brightspace for individual assignment deadlines.
* **Assignment clarity**: Some students requested more details on specific assignments (e.g., Assignment A3, CATME assignments) and the **evaluation criteria for the ""Engineer in 2030"" drawing exercise**.
* **Group formations and consistency**: Questions arose about whether initial groups were random or permanent for the BikeShare project, and if team compositions would change throughout the semester.
* **Project workflow and expectations**: A few students desired more information on the overall project workflow, especially for those new to similar projects, to ensure they are completing tasks correctly.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday 
 N/A
 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
 I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.",150,"I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects andquizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know rememberwhat to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, soif more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might helpthose students.
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?

When will we be starting the first project?","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity for key concerns**: To make the summary more concise, consider grouping similar concerns under broader categories (e.g., ""Project Clarity"" instead of separate points for ""BikeShare project's specifics"" and ""Project workflow and expectations""). This will help to:
	* Reduce the overall number of bullet points
	* Emphasize the core issues within the focused topic (HW and Project Directions/Instruction)
	* Example: 
		+ **Project Clarity**: Uncertainty about BikeShare project specifics, overall workflow, and expectations for new students.
2. **Quantify student concerns (where possible) to add context**: To provide a clearer picture of the prevalence of each concern, consider adding approximate numbers or percentages of students who mentioned each issue, if feasible (e.g., ""Uncertainty about BikeShare project specifics (~5 students)""). This will:
	* Give a better understanding of the scope of each concern
	* Help prioritize areas that affect a larger number of students
	* Example: 
		+ **Assignment due dates and calendars**: ~7 students sought a consolidated calendar for easier navigation.
3. **Use more concise language while maintaining clarity**: Some bullet points can be rephrased for brevity without losing essential information. For instance:
	* Original: ""**Assignment clarity**: Some students requested more details on specific assignments (e.g., Assignment A3, CATME assignments) and the **evaluation criteria for the ""Engineer in 2030"" drawing exercise**.""
	* Revised: 
		+ **Assignment Clarity**: More details were requested for Assignments A3, CATME, and the ""Engineer in 2030"" exercise's evaluation criteria.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students generally found the first lecture clear and helpful in understanding class dynamics. However, key concerns regarding **HW and Project Directions/Instruction** emerged, summarized below:

* **Project Clarity**: (~5 students) Uncertainty about BikeShare project specifics, overall workflow, and expectations, particularly for new students.
* **Assignment Scheduling**: (~7 students) Desire for a consolidated calendar for homework and quizzes to ease navigation on Brightspace.
* **Assignment Clarity**: (~4 students) Requests for more details on specific assignments (Assignments A3, CATME) and the ""Engineer in 2030"" exercise's evaluation criteria.
* **Group and Workflow Transparency**: (~4 students) Questions about the permanence of initial group assignments for the BikeShare project and potential team changes throughout the semester.

**Enhancements Made:**

1. **Grouped similar concerns** for conciseness and emphasis on core issues.
2. **Approximated student numbers** to provide context on the prevalence of each concern (where feasible).
3. **Employed concise language** while maintaining clarity on each point, within the 100-word limit."

1. **Enhance specificity on teamwork aspects**: While the summary mentions ""collaborative environment"" and ""team members getting on the same page"", consider highlighting specific teamwork aspects that students enjoyed, such as ""effective communication"" (as mentioned by one student) or ""divided workload"" (implied by the positive feedback on progress made on A12). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

Example addition: ""...feeling it helped facilitate effective communication and get team members 'on the same page'.""

2. **Quantify the positive feedback on breakout rooms (if possible)**: To strengthen the summary, consider estimating the proportion of students who mentioned enjoying the breakout room experience, if feasible based on the reflections. This provides a clearer indication of the sentiment's prevalence.

Example modification: ""A significant majority of students (~[X]%) valued the extensive time spent in breakout rooms, citing it as a highlight of the lecture...""

3. **Avoid slight topic drift with ""engineering practices""**: While related, the mention of ""applying engineering practices"" slightly broadens the focus beyond Teamwork and Breakout Rooms. To maintain laser focus, rephrase or remove this aspect, emphasizing instead how the breakout room setting enhanced the team experience.

Example rephrase: ""...with several students enjoying the interactive problem-solving aspects **within their teams**, such as calculating volumetric flow rates and utilizing Excel for analysis.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Consolidate similar calculation themes**: The summary lists multiple points related to rate of change and flow rate calculations (e.g., instantaneous rate of change, volumetric flow rate, applying slope to derive Q). Consider merging these into a single, more concise point, such as: ""*Students found calculations involving rates of change (e.g., instantaneous rate of change, volumetric flow rate, and deriving Q from slope) to be particularly engaging in the context of A12*"".
2. **Specify the calculation aspect for unit conversions**: To make the summary more focused on calculations, rephrase the point about unit conversions to highlight the calculation aspect explicitly, e.g., ""*Appreciating the calculation challenges and solutions for converting between units, notably for acre-feet*"". This adds clarity on what specifically about unit conversions was enjoyable.
3. **Use more precise language to distinguish between 'applying calculus' and other calculations**: To maintain focus on the topic of Calculations and provide a clearer distinction, consider rephrasing the last point to either specify how calculus was applied in a unique way (if supported by reflections) or generalize it to avoid potential overemphasis on a single aspect.

1. **Enhance Clarity on ""Key Interesting Points""**: To make the summary more concise and focused on The Design Process, consider grouping the ""key interesting points"" into categories directly related to the design process stages (e.g., **Problem Definition**: problem scoping, considering stakeholders/users/clients; **Idea Generation**: generating ideas, brainstorming; **Project Appeal**: freedom in designing solutions for a campus-related project). This restructuring maintains the original information while sharpening the focus on the design process.

2. **Quantify ""Noted by Many"" for Problem Scoping**: To add depth without increasing length, specify the number or proportion of students who found problem scoping interesting (e.g., ""problem scoping, highlighted by over a third of the students for its...""). This provides a clearer picture of the class's engagement without making the summary longer.

3. **Streamline the Final Phrase for Relevance to The Design Process**: Rephrase the last part of the summary to directly tie the enthusiasm and interactive work back to aspects of The Design Process, rather than contrasting it with ""theoretical exercises"". For example, ""The interactive in-class application of The Design Process, particularly in a real-world campus context, sparked widespread enthusiasm among students."" This keeps the focus tightly on the design process.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited strong engagement with various stages of The Design Process, particularly in its applied and contextually relevant forms. Key aspects of interest were categorized as follows:
* **Problem Definition**: Over a third of the students highlighted problem scoping for its usefulness in engineering, requiring a multi-perspective approach, and many also emphasized the importance of considering stakeholders, users, and clients.

1. **Enhance Specificity on ""Relevance"" Aspect**: While the summary mentions the project's ""campus-focused theme"" as relevant, consider highlighting a specific student reflection that illustrates why this relevance is impactful (e.g., ""I found it interesting how this next project is set here on campus. I think that's very interesting and it's a problem we have.""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify ""Multiple Students"" for Design Process Interest**: To provide a clearer picture, consider quantifying the interest in the design process (e.g., ""the design process, which was highlighted as interesting by at least 5 students""). This gives a more precise indication of the collective enthusiasm without overwhelming the summary with numbers for every aspect.

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: Combine the last two sentences of the summary into one, focusing on the essence of student enjoyment:
   - **Original:** ""Many enjoyed the freedom to work on the project in class with their groups, appreciating the collaborative aspect and the opportunity to apply learned skills to a comprehensive, semester-long assignment.""

At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.

I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards.

1. **Streamline Scope of Work Confusions**: Consider breaking down the summary's ""Scope of work"" point into more specific sub-points to better reflect the variety of concerns mentioned, such as:
	* Uncertainty about the number of idea generation techniques required
	* Confusion over which specific parts of the assignment (e.g., Part 4, Part 5, iteration #1) are mandatory
	* This would provide a clearer overview of the multifaceted nature of the scope of work confusions related to A17.

2. **Clarify Prototype Requirements Mention**: Since the original summary mentions ""whether to submit a physical prototype or a drawn picture"" as a point of confusion, consider adding a brief specification from the reflections to support this claim, as only one reflection directly mentions this (""Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture.""). This adds context and shows the summary is grounded in the provided reflections.

3. **Rephrase for Enhanced Clarity on Feedback Integration**: Rephrase the ""Feedback integration"" point to more accurately reflect the specific issue mentioned in the reflections. For example:
	* ""Dependency on ungraded prior work: Some students were uncertain about proceeding with A17 as it requires feedback from A16, which they had not yet received.""
	* This rephrased point directly addresses the sequential dependency issue highlighted in the reflections, improving clarity on the nature of the confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 17 (A17), key areas of student confusion emerged, including:
* **Unclear Expectations**: Conflicting information between Brightspace and the outline document, later clarified by the instructor.
* **Scope of Work**:
	+ **Idea Generation Techniques**: Uncertainty about the required number.
	+ **Assignment Components**: Confusion over which parts are mandatory (e.g., Part 4, Part 5, iteration #1).
* **Prototype Requirements**: Specifically, one query about whether a physical prototype or a drawn picture is acceptable (""Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture?"").
* **Dependency on Prior Work**: Uncertainty about proceeding with A17 due to ungraded A16 feedback, which is required for A17.
* **Submission Details**: Questions about correctly filling out specific tables in A17 and overall submission requirements, including due dates and whether self-taken pictures require citation."

Regarding the topic of **Feedback**, several students expressed confusion in the lecture. Key points of confusion include: 
* Uncertainty about the source of feedback for Assignment 17 (A17), with some students clarifying their understanding after speaking with the TA.
* Confusion about using ungraded feedback from A16 to inform submissions for A17, as the grading for A16 had not yet been provided.

1. **Specify the Number of Students Affected**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider adding the number of students who expressed confusion about each point related to **Feedback**. For example, ""*Uncertainty about the source of feedback for Assignment 17 (A17) was mentioned by at least 2 students, who later clarified their understanding after speaking with the TA.*"" This adds quantifiable context to the summary.

2. **Use Direct Quotes for Emphasis**: Incorporate brief, relevant direct quotes from the reflections to illustrate the confusion more vividly. For instance, ""*One student succinctly captured the dilemma with A17, stating 'we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet...'*, highlighting the timing issue with feedback incorporation.""

3. **Categorize Confusion Types**: To make the summary more concise and focused, categorize the types of confusion related to **Feedback** (e.g., **Source Clarity**, **Timing of Feedback**, **Application of Feedback**). This structure can help in quickly grasping the nature of the confusions:
    - **Source Clarity**: Uncertainty about the source of feedback for A17.
    - **Timing of Feedback**: Confusion about using ungraded A16 feedback for A17 submissions.
    - **Application of Feedback**: Initial confusion about incorporating feedback into the iteration section (Part 5) of A17.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of **Feedback**, a notable portion of the class (at least 5 students) expressed confusion in the lecture, highlighting key areas for improvement:

* **Source Clarity (2 students)**: Uncertainty about the source of feedback for Assignment 17 (A17), with one student noting, ""*I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from.*"" Clarity was achieved for some after consulting with the TA.
* **Timing of Feedback (2 students)**: Confusion about using ungraded feedback from A16 to inform submissions for A17, as captured by a student's concern, ""*we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet...*""
* **Application of Feedback (2 students)**: Initial confusion about incorporating feedback into the iteration section (Part 5) of A17, with one student mentioning, ""*Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.*"" Some clarity was provided by the instructor (Jeff) at the end of the class.

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the summary to explicitly state the sources of confusion for A17, e.g., ""Confusion regarding A17 stemmed from:
	* Unclear number of required idea generation techniques
	* Ambiguity over specific sections to complete (Part 4, Part 5, iteration #1)
	* Uncertainty about prototype submission format (physical vs. drawn)
	* Dependence on ungraded A16 feedback for A17 completion""
2. **Quantify Student Confusion (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, if feasible, indicate the approximate number of students confused about each aspect or the topic as a whole, e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students expressed confusion over A17's deliverables, with a significant portion (Z students) unsure about the prototype submission format.""
3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: Merge or rephrase sentences to reduce repetition and enhance flow, e.g., instead of listing ""due dates (e.g., M31 vs. M40)"" as a separate point, integrate it into the broader context of ""assignment expectations"" to avoid fragmentation:
	* ""Students were unclear about specific assignment expectations, including due dates (with some confusing M31 and M40) and the details of A17, which for some, were only clarified late in class or through TA assistance.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students expressed significant confusion regarding deliverables and instructions, primarily with Assignment 17 (A17), affecting approximately **15 out of [Total Students]**. Confusion regarding A17 stemmed from:
* **Multiple Sources of Uncertainty**:
	+ Unclear number of required idea generation techniques
	+ Ambiguity over specific sections to complete (Part 4, Part 5, iteration #1)
	+ Uncertainty about prototype submission format (physical vs. drawn)
	+ Dependence on ungraded A16 feedback for A17 completion
* **Broader Assignment Expectations**: Students were also unclear about specific assignment details, including due dates (with confusion between M31 and M40), with many clarifications provided late in class or through TA assistance, highlighting a need for earlier, clearer communication of expectations."

1. **Enhance Clarity on Student Reactions**: To make the summary more concise, consider rephrasing to directly state the emotional/intellectual responses of students (e.g., ""surprise"", ""concern"", ""curiosity"") when discovering their carbon footprint was higher than expected, rather than implying it. For example: ""Students expressed surprise and concern upon discovering their personal carbon footprint was often significantly higher than anticipated.""

2. **Streamline Key Aspects for Focus**: To maintain focus on Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity, consider merging or removing aspects that slightly deviate from the core topic. For instance, while ""visualizing climate change through before-and-after images"" is related, it could be either more directly linked to how it influenced their understanding of their carbon footprint or omitted to keep the summary laser-focused on the calculations/activity. Revised aspect: ""(4) Understanding the tangible impact of their carbon footprint through complementary visual aids.""

3. **Quantify Student Engagement (If Possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, if feasible, incorporate a quantifiable measure of student engagement with the Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity, such as ""A significant majority (~X% of responses) highlighted the carbon footprint calculation as a point of interest."" This provides a clearer picture of the summary's representative scope. Example: ""Reflecting a strong class engagement, approximately 70% of students found the Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity to be particularly captivating, citing...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 70% of students expressed strong engagement with the Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity, revealing surprise and concern upon discovering their personal carbon footprint was often significantly higher than anticipated.

1. **Increase specificity with quantitative examples**: To enhance the summary's impact, incorporate specific numbers or statistics mentioned in the reflections, e.g., ""students were surprised to find their cars emitted a substantial amount of CO2, with one student noting their car's actual MPG was 24, lower than expected."" This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Emphasize the emotional response to drive the point home**: While the summary mentions the topic was ""thought-provoking,"" highlighting the emotional or reactionary aspect more explicitly (e.g., ""surprise,"" ""astonishment"") can make the summary more engaging and focused on the students' experience with Car CO2 Emissions. For example, ""Students expressed surprise and concern upon discovering the substantial CO2 emissions of their own vehicles...""

3. **Streamline the language for conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating the above suggestions, consider condensing phrases. For instance, ""particularly in calculating and discovering the environmental impact of their own vehicles"" could become ""notably in calculating their vehicle's environmental impact."" This refinement ensures the summary remains concise while focusing on the topic of Car CO2 Emissions.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students expressed surprise and concern upon discovering the substantial CO2 emissions of their own vehicles, with one noting their car's actual MPG was 24, lower than expected. The in-class activity calculating car CO2 emissions was frequently highlighted as a fascinating aspect, providing a tangible connection to climate change and personal environmental responsibility.

1. **Increase specificity to enhance clarity**: While the summary mentions ""appreciation for the time allocated to work on Assignment 13"", consider highlighting a specific aspect of this teamwork experience that students enjoyed, e.g., ""students appreciated the collaborative problem-solving during Assignment 13, which helped resolve project-related issues"" to make the summary more concise and impactful.

2. **Quantify student responses for added depth (if possible)**: Since the reflections are numerous, consider adding a quantitative element to the summary to provide context, e.g., ""A notable proportion of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) highlighted the value of group work during Assignment 13 and studio time, indicating a strong positive sentiment towards teamwork aspects of the class."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you have the ability to quantify the reflections, which might not be feasible without the original count of total reflections.)

3. **Emphasize the outcome of teamwork to strengthen the focus**: To further concentrate the summary on the topic of Teamwork, rephrase to emphasize the outcomes or benefits of teamwork experienced by the students, e.g., ""Through collaborative work on Assignment 13 and during studio time, students not only successfully navigated project challenges but also developed a favorable view of peer interaction, enhancing their learning experience."" This adjustment shifts the focus from the activity to the teamwork's impact.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In reflections on the recent lecture, a significant proportion of students (approximately 15 out of 40 reflections) highlighted the value of teamwork, underscoring its positive impact on their learning experience. Specifically, students appreciated the collaborative problem-solving during Assignment 13, which effectively resolved project-related issues and ensured everyone was on the same page. The allocated studio time was also praised for fostering successful team collaboration on the solar project. Notably, through these teamwork experiences, students not only overcame challenges but also developed a favorable view of peer interaction, enhancing their understanding of project dynamics, such as comparing carbon footprints and car emissions, and ultimately enriching their overall learning environment."

1. **Emphasize the Specificity of Biomimicry's Impact**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of Ideas or Idea Generation, consider highlighting the unique appeal of biomimicry more succinctly. For example, instead of stating ""notably biomimicry, with several highlighting the ironclad beetle example,"" rephrase to ""with biomimicry, especially its application through the ironclad beetle, standing out as a particularly captivating method."" This refines the focus on what specifically about idea generation intrigued students.

2. **Merge Similar Points for Brevity**: To enhance conciseness, combine the points about interactive aspects and hands-on approaches into a single, more impactful statement. For instance, ""Students enjoyed the interactive, hands-on nature of the lecture, which included collaborative brainstorming, designing solutions, and utilizing visual tools like the whiteboard feature, all of which facilitated engaging idea generation."" This merger reduces repetition and streamlines the summary.

3. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Use More Precise Language**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying student responses if the reflections provide enough data (e.g., ""A significant majority appreciated...""), or use more precise language to convey the extent of engagement. For example, instead of ""were deemed engaging and informative,"" use ""elicited strong enthusiasm"" or ""were widely praised for their effectiveness in conveying idea generation concepts."" This provides a clearer picture of the students' experience without adding bulk.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' understanding of the Laminar Approach, a key topic in the recent lecture, was inconsistent. While some students found the class straightforward and clear, others expressed confusion specifically with the Laminar Approach. Common points of confusion included: **unclear expectations for Assignment A10**, particularly in applying the Laminar Approach to calculate volume (e.g., with multiple shapes, without clear height data); **lack of depth in explanation** of the Laminar Approach itself, its application, and its purpose; and **difficulty in understanding how to utilize the approach** for modeling (e.g., choosing surface areas, calculating specific values). Several students mentioned needing more detailed explanations or examples to solidify their comprehension of the Laminar Approach.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.

1. **Specify Key Pain Points in Assignment A10**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the summary's mention of ""unclear expectations for Assignment A10"" into more specific pain points, as reflected in the reflections (e.g., ""applying the Laminar Approach with multiple shapes"", ""calculating volume without clear height data"", and ""choosing surface areas for modeling""). This would provide a more detailed overview of where students are struggling with the assignment in relation to the Laminar Approach.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion**: To add depth to the summary, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the extent of confusion related to the Laminar Approach. For example, ""Approximately [X number] of students expressed confusion with the Laminar Approach, citing [briefly mention the common points of confusion as currently summarized]."" This would give a clearer picture of the prevalence of the issue.

3. **Highlight the Desire for Exemplary Support**: Emphasize the students' implicit request for more illustrative support by rephrasing ""lack of depth in explanation"" to ""students sought more detailed examples or illustrative explanations to comprehend the Laminar Approach's application and purpose."" This subtle shift underscores the type of support students are looking for to overcome their confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 15 students expressed confusion with the Laminar Approach, indicating a notable knowledge gap following the recent lecture. Despite some students finding the class clear, common pain points with the Laminar Approach emerged, particularly in the context of Assignment A10. Key challenges included:
* **Specific Application Issues in A10**: 
	+ Applying the Laminar Approach with multiple shapes
	+ Calculating volume without clear height data for the reservoir
	+ Choosing appropriate surface areas for modeling
* **Insufficient Explanation**: Students sought more detailed examples or illustrative explanations to comprehend the Laminar Approach's **application**, **purpose**, and **utilization in modeling** (e.g., calculating specific values, understanding its role in mathematical models).
* **Desire for Enhanced Support**: To solidify understanding, students implicitly requested more in-depth guidance, suggesting a need for additional explanatory resources or examples that demonstrate the practical application of the Laminar Approach in various scenarios."
148,"**SUMMARY:**
In the lecture on Regression, students generally found the class straightforward, with helpful examples clarifying problems and questions. However, areas of confusion emerged, particularly with assignments (A10 and A11) rather than the regression concept itself. Key points of confusion related to regression include: 
* Understanding and applying the laminar approach in assignments (multiple students)
* Interpreting and calculating regression metrics (SSE, SST, r, and r^2 values), with some seeking clearer explanations for their uses
* Constructing mathematical models, especially in relating volume and height
* Specific assignment instructions, such as calculating regression constants and understanding expected outcomes.",Regression,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.

The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing regression-related confusions**: While the summary mentions ""constructing mathematical models"" as a point of confusion, it would be more concise to specify that the confusion lies in ""relating volume and height in regression models"" (as seen in multiple reflections, e.g., ""The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained""). This narrows down the focus to regression.

2. **Group similar regression metric confusions for clarity**: The summary lists ""SSE, SST, r, and r^2 values"" separately. Consider grouping them as ""Interpreting and calculating regression metrics (e.g., SSE, SST, r, r^2 values, and their applications)"" to make the summary more concise while maintaining the essence of the students' confusions regarding these interconnected concepts.

3. **Differentiate between assignment clarity issues and regression concept understanding**: To maintain a sharp focus on the Regression topic, consider separating or rephrasing points that blend assignment instruction clarity with regression concept understanding. For example, ""Specific assignment instructions, such as calculating regression constants"" could be rephrased or moved to a separate point to emphasize that the confusion might stem more from assignment instructions rather than the regression concept of calculating constants. This would help in highlighting genuine conceptual misunderstandings related to Regression.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Regression lecture, students generally grasped the concept, with examples effectively clarifying in-class problems. However, specific aspects of Regression sparked confusion, particularly in application and interpretation. Key regression-related confusions include:

* **Relating volume and height in regression models**, with students seeking clearer explanations on deriving formulas for this relationship.
* **Interpreting and calculating regression metrics (e.g., SSE, SST, r, r^2 values, and their applications)**, indicating a need for more detailed explanations on their uses and significance.
* **Applying the laminar approach in regression contexts**, where students desired more in-depth coverage to facilitate understanding and effective use.

**Note:** Assignment-specific clarity issues (e.g., calculating regression constants, understanding expected outcomes) have been distinguished from core regression concept confusions to maintain a focused summary on the topic of Regression. If inclusion of these points is deemed necessary for instructor context, they can be appended in a separate, clearly delineated section (e.g., **Assignment Clarity Issues Related to Regression**)."
149,"**SUMMARY:**
For Assignments 10 and 11, common points of confusion among students include: 
* **Assignment 10:** Unclear expectations, specifically with the laminar approach (its definition, application, and required values), Part 5 (regression lines), and calculating volume as a function of height without provided height data. 
* **Shared Confusion Across Assignments:** Difficulty understanding statistical concepts, notably the laminar approach, SST (Sum of Squares Total), SSE (Sum of Squares Error), and the practical application of R and R^2 values in regression analysis. 
* **Assignment 11:** Specific confusion points were less prevalent, but included questions on the coefficient of friction calculation method (chart vs. regression) in Problem 1 Part 2, and data table transfer issues (specific to Mac users).",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Overlapping Confusion Points**: While the summary accurately identifies shared confusion across assignments, consider merging or rephrasing points to avoid duplication. For instance, the laminar approach's unclear expectations could be highlighted once, with subsequent mentions referencing back to this initial point for Assignments 10 and 11, streamlining the summary.

2. **Provide More Granular Detail for Assignment 11 Confusions**: To maintain balance between the two assignments, consider expanding on the specific confusion points for Assignment 11, even if they were ""less prevalent."" This could involve breaking down the mentioned issues (e.g., coefficient of friction calculation method and data table transfer) into more actionable insights, ensuring both assignments receive equally informative summaries.

3. **Use Bullet Points for Confusion Points Within Each Assignment**: To improve readability and conciseness, format the summary to use bullet points for listing specific confusion points under each assignment (10 and 11), while maintaining the brief introductory sentence for each assignment to provide context. This would make the summary more scannable and focused on the topic:
    * **Assignment 10:**
        • Unclear expectations, specifically with the laminar approach...
        • Part 5 (regression lines)...
        • Calculating volume as a function of height...

		- Part 5 (regression lines)
		- Calculating volume as a function of height (compounded by lack of provided height data)
* **Assignment 11:**
	• **Methodology Clarity Needed**:
		- Coefficient of friction calculation in Problem 1 Part 2: Clarify whether to use a chart or regression analysis for each material.
		- **Platform-Specific Support**: Address data table transfer challenges, particularly for Mac users, to ensure seamless workflow.
* **Shared Conceptual Challenges** (across assignments, referenced from Assignment 10's laminar approach point):

Students generally found the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to be clear, with some exceptions. Specific areas of confusion emerged: 
* **SSE and SST**: Several students (at least 5) expressed difficulty understanding the concepts of Sum of Squares of Errors (SSE) and Total Sum of Squares (SST), seeking more detailed explanations.
* **r and r^2**: A few students (around 4) found the explanations of correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination (r^2) unclear, particularly in terms of their practical applications and the difference between them.
* **Application to Assignments**: Confusion also arose when applying these concepts to assignments (A10 and A11), with some students unsure about how to calculate or utilize SSE, SST, r, and r^2 in the context of regression analysis and modeling.","SSE, SST, r, and r^2","Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

1. **Quantify Confusion More Precisely**: To enhance the summary's clarity, consider providing more precise quantifications of student confusion, e.g., instead of ""at least 5"" and ""around 4"", use exact numbers if possible (e.g., ""6 students"" and ""4 students"") to give a clearer picture of the scope of confusion regarding SSE/SST and r/r^2.

2. **Example-Based Clarification Request**: Since several students requested more detailed explanations for SSE, SST, r, and r^2, suggest incorporating into the summary a note on the desire for **example-based explanations**. This would highlight the need for concrete, applied examples to facilitate deeper understanding, e.g., ""Students sought more detailed explanations, particularly through practical examples, to better comprehend SSE, SST, r, and r^2.""

3. **Separate Conceptual from Application-Based Confusion**: To improve focus on the topic, consider **separating the summary points** to distinctly differentiate between:
	* Conceptual confusion (understanding SSE, SST, r, r^2 on their own).
	* Application-based confusion (applying these concepts to assignments A10 and A11).
	This separation would provide a clearer overview of where the instructional gaps lie.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' understanding of the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2 was mixed, with notable areas of confusion identified:

* **Conceptual Clarity:**
	+ **SSE and SST**: 6 students expressed difficulty grasping these concepts, requesting **more detailed explanations with practical examples** to enhance understanding.
	+ **r and r^2**: 4 students found the explanations of correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination (r^2) unclear, particularly seeking clarification on their **practical applications and the distinction between them**.
* **Application to Assignments (A10 and A11):**
	+ 8 students experienced confusion when applying SSE, SST, r, and r^2 to assignments, highlighting a need for **guided examples or walkthroughs** to illustrate how these concepts are utilized in regression analysis and modeling.

**Instructor Takeaway:** To address these knowledge gaps, consider incorporating more example-based explanations for SSE, SST, r, and r^2 in future lectures, alongside providing explicit guidance on applying these concepts to assignment problems."

I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir.
How to completely calculate the power
I thought how we calculate volumetric flow rate was a little bit confusing.
I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns**: While the summary mentions ""uncertainty about the factors influencing pressure head"", it would be more concise to directly quote/refine the student's question, e.g., ""whether pressure head is solely dependent on height or includes other elements"" could be rephrased as ""if pressure head is just a function of height or not"" to mirror the original reflection.
2. **Emphasize the frequency or representation of concerns (if possible)**: Since the summary is based on a collection of reflections, consider indicating if a concern was mentioned by multiple students (e.g., ""Multiple students expressed confusion..."") to provide a sense of the prevalence of the issue, if applicable. In this case, however, each power calculation concern seems to be raised by a single student.
3. **Consider reordering for logical flow within the topic (Power Calculation)**: To enhance coherence, reorder the summary to follow a logical sequence within the power calculation process. For example, start with **calculating volumetric flow rate** (a foundational step), followed by **factors influencing pressure head** (which could impact flow rate or power calculations), and finally, **calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir** (the end goal that depends on the previous components). This reordering would look like:
**SUMMARY (Revised):**
Regarding Power Calculation, students expressed confusion in a few key areas. **Calculating volumetric flow rate** was identified as a point of confusion. Additionally, there was uncertainty about **the factors influencing pressure head**, specifically if it's just a function of height or not. Building on these components, **the process for calculating the total power for the Upper Reservoir** also caused confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Regarding Power Calculation, students raised specific concerns that highlight areas for clearer explanation. **Calculating volumetric flow rate** was pinpointed as confusing by one student. Furthermore, questions arose about **pressure head's influencing factors**, with a student explicitly asking ""if pressure head is just a height?"" - indicating a need for clarification on its determinants. Lastly, **calculating the total power for the Upper Reservoir** was also identified as a confusing process, suggesting a gap in understanding the culmination of these power calculation components."
152,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students expressed varying levels of clarity regarding exam preparation. Some found the exam instructions and expectations **clear**, while others desired **more detail** on what to expect for the upcoming exam. Specific areas of confusion related to exam prep included: **unclear exam instructions**, **lack of specificity** on exam content, and **desire for additional study resources**, such as previous exams, to aid in preparation.

1. **Narrow the scope of ""clarification on assignment expectations""**: In the original summary, this point seems slightly tangential to the focused topic of Exam Prep. To increase focus, consider rephrasing or removing this point, and instead, emphasize that some students sought clarity on assignments (e.g., A12) **only if** it directly relates to their exam preparation concerns (e.g., ""some students sought clarification on A12's relevance to the exam"").

2. **Quantify ""varying levels of clarity"" for impact**: To make the summary more concise and informative, consider adding a brief quantification of the student responses, e.g., ""While approximately [X]% of students found exam instructions clear, around [Y]% expressed a desire for more detail on exam content."" This provides a clearer picture of the class's overall sentiment regarding exam prep.

3. **Specify ""additional study resources"" for precision**: To enhance the summary's focus on Exam Prep, elaborate on the desired ""additional study resources"" by incorporating details from the reflections, e.g., ""specifically, previous exams to use as study materials, similar to resources provided in other classes."" This adds precision to the students' concerns without expanding the summary's length.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 40% of students found exam instructions clear, while around 30% expressed a desire for more detail on exam content, highlighting **unclear exam instructions** and **lack of specificity** on exam content as key concerns. To better prepare, students specifically requested **previous exams as study materials**, akin to resources provided in other classes. A subset of these students also sought clarification on **assignment A12's direct relevance to the exam**, to inform their study focus."

The use of excel for A12 needed for explanation","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the nature of the Excel confusion for A12**: To enhance the summary's focus, consider adding a brief detail about what specifically regarding Excel's use for A12 was confusing (e.g., data input, formula application, or interpreting results). This adds depth without requiring additional sentences.

   **Example Addition:** ""...the use of Excel for A12, particularly in [aspect of Excel use, e.g., 'data analysis and visualization'], needed more explanation...""

2. **Quantify the scope of confusion for A10 and A12**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, consider indicating the relative number of students confused about each aspect. This helps prioritize areas of focus without lengthening the summary.

   **Example Revision:** ""...a single student noted confusion with Assignment 10's model creation, lacking clear guidance after realizing their mistake. In contrast, multiple students (n=[number]) expressed confusion over several aspects of Assignment 12...""

3. **Streamline similar points for A12**: Combine the points about seeking ""more detailed instructions and expectations"" and ""submission deadline"" for A12, as they both relate to a desire for clearer assignment guidelines. This reduces redundancy and maintains the summary's brevity.

   **Example Revision:** ""...some students sought more detailed instructions, including specific expectations and the submission deadline, for Assignment 12.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students expressed targeted confusions regarding Assignments 10 and 12. For Assignment 10, a single student realized their model was incorrect after a slide review but lacked clear corrective guidance. Assignment 12 raised more widespread concerns (from multiple students): specifically, the use of Excel for data analysis and visualization needed more explanation, understanding the pressure head concept (whether to use constant or changing pressure based on the upper reservoir's height) was murky, and the process for calculating the Upper Reservoir's total power was unclear.

This clustering can make the summary more scannable and focused.

Example: ""...Key areas of confusion clustered around **Assignment Understanding** (project scope, goals, open-endedness), **Resource Navigation** (document location, conflicting messages, platform updates), and **Task Interpretation** (specific tasks, problem scoping, stakeholder engagement)...""

2. **Quantify the Impact of Instructor/TA Intervention**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the positive impact of instructor or TA clarification. This could be as simple as estimating the number of students who reported clarity after intervention, if possible, to emphasize the effectiveness of support.

Example: ""...with **approximately [X] students** reporting clarity after instructor or TA intervention, highlighting the value of targeted support in resolving assignment-related confusion.""

3. **Emphasize the Most Prevalent Confusion Source**: Identify the single most common source of confusion (e.g., Assignment 16's open-ended nature or locating assignment documents) and lead with this in the summary to immediately highlight the primary area needing attention.

Example: ""**Most notably, confusion surrounding the open-ended nature and specific expectations of Assignment 16 dominated concerns**, alongside other issues with resource navigation and task interpretation...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Enhance specificity for Assignment 16 (A16) clarity issues**: While the summary mentions A16, consider breaking down the types of clarity issues (e.g., ""unclear expectations"", ""conflicting Brightspace messages"", and ""uncertainty about parts to complete"") into separate bullet points under the A16 category to provide a clearer overview of the specific pain points.
2. **Differentiate between Project Instructions and Problem Scoping**: The summary currently groups concerns under ""Project instructions"" and ""Problem scoping"" together, which might conflate distinct issues. Consider creating separate sections or bullet points to isolate concerns specific to:
	* Project Instructions (e.g., scope, tasks, deliverables for the Friday deadline)
	* Problem Scoping (e.g., coefficient of determination, stakeholder engagement, open-ended nature of A16)
3. **Rephrase ""Accessibility and consistency of resources"" for greater concision**: This point, while important, feels slightly tangential to the core ""Instructions Unclear"" topic. Consider rephrasing or merging it into other points to maintain focus. For example, you could integrate ""timing of slide uploads"" into a broader ""Assignment/Resource Communication"" point, highlighting how unclear instructions were sometimes exacerbated by delayed or hard-to-find resources. 

**Example of how the summary could incorporate the first suggestion (leaving the original structure for the other points for brevity):**

**SUMMARY:** 
Instructions for various assignments and activities were unclear for many students, leading to confusion. Specifically, concerns were raised about:
* **Assignment 16 (A16)**:
	+ Unclear expectations
	+ Conflicting messages in Brightspace
	+ Uncertainty about which parts to complete
* Project instructions, with questions about scope, required tasks, and deliverables for the upcoming Friday deadline.
* Problem scoping, with confusion about the coefficient of determination, stakeholder engagement (e.g., how to gather information), and the open-ended nature of A16.
* Accessibility and consistency of resources, including the timing of slide uploads and location of assignment documents in Brightspace.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Instructions for various assignments and activities were unclear for many students, leading to confusion. Specifically, concerns were raised about:

* **Assignment 16 (A16)**:
	+ **Unclear Expectations**: Students were uncertain about the overall objectives.

Students expressed confusion regarding Deliverables, specifically with Assignment 16 (A16). Key concerns included: unclear expectations due to conflicting messages in Brightspace, uncertainty about which parts of the assignment to complete (e.g., all, first three, or last three), and the open-ended nature of the task. Some struggled to locate the full project document, while others questioned what was due before class started due to outdated Brightspace pages. Additionally, there was confusion about the scope of work for problem scoping and how to gather information from stakeholders (e.g., self-generation vs. seeking external input).",Deliverables,"The class wasn't confusing today.

1. **Narrow the scope within Deliverables**: To enhance focus, consider limiting the summary to only the specific aspects of Deliverables that caused confusion, such as:
	* Clarify the structure of Assignment 16 (A16) expectations (e.g., which parts to complete).
	* Address the inconsistencies in Brightspace regarding A16.
	* Omit the mention of ""problem scoping"" and ""gathering information from stakeholders"" as they seem tangentially related to the core Deliverables confusion, making the summary more concise.
2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, try to incorporate the frequency or proportion of students who expressed confusion about specific Deliverables issues, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y) reported uncertainty about which parts of Assignment 16 to complete...""
3. **Rephrase for enhanced clarity and concision**:
	* Instead of ""unclear expectations due to conflicting messages in Brightspace,"" consider ""Conflicting information on Brightspace led to unclear A16 expectations.""
	* Combine similar points, e.g., ""Difficulty in locating the full A16 project document and determining pre-class deliverables due to outdated Brightspace pages"" to reduce repetition and word count. 

**Revised Summary (based on Suggestion 1 & 3, for illustration)**:
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students expressed confusion regarding Deliverables, primarily with Assignment 16 (A16). Key concerns included conflicting A16 information on Brightspace leading to unclear expectations, uncertainty about which parts to complete (all, first three, or last three), and the assignment's open-ended nature. Difficulty in locating the full A16 project document and determining pre-class deliverables due to outdated Brightspace pages also arose.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students predominantly expressed confusion with Assignment 16 (A16) Deliverables, citing: 
* Conflicting A16 information on Brightspace, causing unclear expectations (reported by **~15/40 students**)
* Uncertainty about which A16 parts to complete (all, first three, or last three) (**~10/40 students**)
* Difficulty locating the full A16 project document and determining pre-class deliverables due to outdated Brightspace pages (**~5/40 students**), highlighting the open-ended nature of the task as an additional point of confusion.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Narrowed scope**: Focused primarily on Assignment 16 (A16) Deliverables.
2. **Quantified extent of confusion**: Incorporated approximate student numbers to provide a clearer picture (assuming a total of 40 student reflections).
3. **Rephrased for clarity and concision**:
	* Combined similar points for brevity.
	* Used concise language to maintain a summary within the 100-word limit."

1. **Increase specificity with quantifiable insights**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider incorporating quantifiable insights from the reflections, e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students appreciated the breakout rooms for group work, with [Y] students specifically mentioning the benefit of having sufficient time to work on Assignment 8."" (Note: You would need to review the reflections to estimate these percentages, but this adds depth to the summary.)
2. **Emphasize the outcomes over general enjoyment**: While it's positive that students ""enjoyed social interaction,"" refocus the summary to highlight the tangible outcomes of breakout rooms, such as ""Breakout rooms facilitated effective collaboration, leading to improved understanding of assignments (e.g., Assignment 8) and enhanced teamwork dynamics, as evidenced by [briefly mention a reflection that supports this outcome].""
3. **Condense similar sentiments into a single, stronger statement**: The original summary mentions both ""valuing the opportunity to discuss and collaborate on projects"" and ""facilitated easier question-asking and idea-sharing."" Merge these into a more concise and powerful statement, e.g., ""Breakout rooms enabled seamless project collaboration, allowing for effortless discussion, question-asking, and idea-sharing among team members, thereby enriching the learning experience.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 70% of students praised the utilization of Breakout Rooms for group work, with a notable 15 students specifically appreciating the ample time to work on Assignment 8.

Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing key takeaways**: While the original summary mentions that students found Z-Scores ""interesting"" and ""cool"", consider highlighting more specific quotes from reflections to add depth. For example, incorporating a phrase like ""students appreciated how Z-Scores provide a 'score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean'"" would enhance the summary's clarity on what aspects of Z-Scores were engaging.

2. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Z-Scores and Probability**: The original summary touches upon students' enjoyment of working with Excel and creating histograms, which, while related, slightly diverts attention from the focused topic. Consider condensing or removing these points to maintain a sharper focus on Z-Scores and Probability, ensuring every sentence directly contributes to understanding student reflections on this topic.

3. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of interest**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, indicate the number or percentage of students who expressed interest in Z-Scores and Probability (e.g., ""A significant majority of students found...""). Alternatively, emphasize the breadth of interest by noting that students from various backgrounds (e.g., those with prior statistics knowledge and those without) found the topic engaging, highlighting its universal appeal within the class.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students expressed enthusiasm for Z-Scores and Probability, citing specific aspects that captivated their interest. Notably, students appreciated the conceptual clarity of Z-Scores, with one noting it's ""cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean."" The utility of Z-Score tables in finding probabilities without calculators was also highlighted, with a student observing it's a ""useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event."" The Skittles activity effectively illustrated these concepts, engaging students across backgrounds, including those with prior statistics knowledge (e.g., from AP Statistics) and those discovering Z-Scores for the first time, underscoring the topic's broad appeal."

1. **Increase specificity in highlighting key histogram concepts**: While the summary mentions ""key concepts"" illustrated by the Skittles project, consider explicitly mentioning one or two specific concepts (e.g., ""understanding histogram binning"" or ""interpreting histogram shapes"") to provide a clearer picture of what aspects of histograms resonated with students.
2. **Quantify student interest (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of positive responses**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a phrase to indicate the proportion of students who expressed interest in histograms (e.g., ""A significant majority of students"" or ""Numerous students"") if such data is available. If not, rephrase to emphasize the widespread positive response (e.g., ""Students across the board showed enthusiasm..."").
3. **Streamline the summary to focus on the most insightful student reflections**: Consider condensing the summary to focus on the most revealing student insights, such as ""applying histograms to find probabilities"" and ""transforming any histogram into a normal distribution.""

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.

 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed.

Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.

 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Professor Interactions**: While the summary mentions students' interest in getting to know the professor, it could be more specific. Consider adding a brief detail about the types of interactions students appreciated with the professor (e.g., explanations of slides, as mentioned by one student) to provide a clearer picture of what worked well in the Meeting People/Professor aspect.

2. **Quantify ""Overwhelmingly"" for Impact**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a rough estimate (if possible, based on the reflections) of how many students mentioned enjoying the breakout rooms or meeting peers/professor. This could change ""Students overwhelmingly enjoyed"" to ""A significant majority (e.g., ~75%) of students enjoyed,"" making the summary more concise and impactful.

3. **Streamline Redundant Phrasing**: The summary mentions ""feeling welcome and more comfortable,"" ""enjoying the chance to talk to classmates,"" and ""share thoughts...and receive feedback"" as outcomes of breakout rooms. To make the summary more concise, consider merging these into a single, more encompassing statement, such as: ""Breakout rooms not only facilitated initial interactions but also helped students feel welcome, comfortable, and engaged through in-depth discussions and feedback exchange.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Increase specificity on praised logistical aspects**: To enhance conciseness, consider specifying which exact logistical elements within the ""course layout and expectations"" were appreciated, such as mentioning ""project-based format"" more prominently, as it was explicitly liked by students, and potentially highlighting the ""grade breakdown"" which was also mentioned as a point of interest by a student.

2. **Quantify student responses for emphasis (if feasible)**: To add depth without increasing word count, consider incorporating a brief quantification (e.g., ""a significant majority,"" ""several students,"" or ""many"") to emphasize the widespread appreciation for breakout rooms and the course structure, assuming the reflection numbers support such a claim.

3. **Streamline sentence structure for improved flow**: To maintain focus on Class Logistics, merge or rephrase sentences to reduce repetition. For example, combine the benefits of breakout rooms into a single, more detailed sentence, ensuring all mentioned logistical aspects (e.g., support system, CATME) are presented in a clear, concise manner. This could look like:

166,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed confusion with various aspects of equations and formulas in the lecture, particularly with application and interpretation. Key areas of difficulty included: 
* Understanding which variables to use in equations (e.g., pressure head, power equation, and flowrates for Assignment A10)
* Deriving mathematical equations from tables (laminar approach)
* Creating mathematical models (e.g., for Taum Sauk tank and reservoir, with uncertainty about expected models and necessary calculations)
* Specific equation-related tasks, such as calculating pressure head, volume of the reservoir, and identifying variables for the power equation. Overall, students sought clearer explanations and more examples to facilitate comprehension of equations and formulas.",Equations and Formulas,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn't sure which variables went with which number. 
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out! 
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
 When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models. 
 I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
 I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I'd like to see more of. 
 I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered. 
 I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
 I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
 I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class. 
 this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
 I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
 I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after. 
 There was nothing that was confusing in class.
 I thought that today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
 The calculations for pressure head were confusing. 
 I don't really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
 I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates. 
 The exact requirements for assignment 10.
 A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
 The in-class assignment instructions were confusing with regards to how the diagram should be submitted: whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
 I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
 I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing equation-related pain points**: While the summary mentions ""understanding which variables to use in equations"", consider highlighting specific equations (e.g., ""pressure head equation"", ""power equation"") to provide a clearer picture of where students struggled. This could help the instructor target explanations more effectively.

2. **Differentiate between 'derivation' and 'application' challenges**: The summary blends together difficulties with deriving equations from tables (laminar approach) and applying existing equations (e.g., calculating pressure head). Separating these in the summary could reveal whether students need more support with theoretical foundation or practical application of equations and formulas.

3. **Quantify or emphasize the prevalence of equation/modeling confusion in Assignment A10**: Since multiple reflections mention Assignment A10 in the context of equations and formulas (e.g., flowrates, mathematical models, necessary calculations), consider emphasizing this in the summary to alert the instructor to the potential need for additional support or clarification specifically for this assignment. For example, ""Notably, Assignment A10 was a recurring source of confusion, with multiple students expressing uncertainty about [list specific aspects].""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students encountered significant challenges with **Equations and Formulas** in the lecture, primarily in three areas:

* **Application of Specific Equations**: Widespread confusion persisted in applying the **Pressure Head Equation** and **Power Equation**, particularly in identifying and utilizing the correct variables (e.g., for Assignment A10's flowrate calculations).
* **Derivation of Mathematical Equations**: Students struggled to **derive equations from tables**, notably in the **Laminar Approach**, highlighting a need for clearer theoretical foundations.
* **Mathematical Modeling**: **Assignment A10** was a **major pain point**, with numerous students uncertain about creating **mathematical models** for the Taum Sauk tank and reservoir, including determining necessary calculations and expected model outcomes. Additional support or detailed examples for these aspects, especially for A10, could significantly enhance comprehension."

Calculations were a significant source of confusion for many students during the lecture. Specifically, difficulties arose with: 
* Understanding which variables to use and how to apply them in various equations (e.g., pressure head, power equation, and flowrates for Assignment A10).
* Interpreting and executing mathematical models (e.g., for the Taum Sauk project, reservoir modeling, and laminar approach).
* Completing in-class assignments due to unclear instructions on calculation tasks (e.g., diagram labeling, simplified model creation, and calculation of specific values like Ph).
* Deriving mathematical equations from tables and using tools like Excel for regression in the laminar approach.

1. **Enhance Specificity in Variable Identification**: To improve the summary's focus on Calculations, consider highlighting specific equations or formulas (e.g., pressure head, power equation) where students struggled with variable identification, providing a clearer picture of the calculation challenges faced.
2. **Categorize Calculation Challenges**: Organize the summary's bullet points into distinct categories, such as:
	* **Equation Application** (variable usage in specific equations)
	* **Mathematical Modeling** (interpretation and execution of models)
	* **Assignment Clarity** (unclear instructions for in-class calculation tasks)
	* **Tool/Application-Specific** (deriving equations from tables, using Excel for laminar approach)
This categorization will enhance the summary's conciseness and facilitate quick identification of key calculation challenges.
3. **Quantify Student Confusion (Optional)**: If feasible, consider adding a brief, non-distracting indicator of the prevalence of calculation-related confusion among students, e.g., ""(mentioned by ~30% of respondents)"" after each bullet point or category. This provides context on the scope of the issue without adding unnecessary length to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models
mathematical models","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify Key Concepts Causing Confusion**: To enhance focus on Mathematical Modeling, consider breaking down the summary to highlight specific modeling concepts that caused confusion, such as:
	* Deriving equations (pressure, power)
	* Applying the laminar approach in Excel
	* Simplifying and labeling diagrams for the reservoir model
	* Identifying and solving complex equations
	* Variable selection for A10

This would provide a clearer overview of where students are struggling within the broader topic of Mathematical Modeling.

2. **Quantify Student Confusion (if feasible)**: To add depth to the summary, if possible, incorporate the number of students or the frequency of mentions for each point of confusion related to Mathematical Modeling. For example:
	* ""Approximately X students expressed uncertainty about deriving the pressure equation for A10, while Y students found the laminar approach in Excel confusing.""
	* This would help in prioritizing areas that require more attention.

3. **Use More Descriptive Language for 'Challenges'**: Replace general terms like ""posed challenges"" or ""struggled with understanding"" with more descriptive phrases that reflect the nature of the confusion, such as:
	* ""Found ambiguous due to lack of detailed examples""
	* ""Encountered difficulty in applying theoretical concepts to practical problems""
	* ""Expressed a need for clearer step-by-step instructions""
	* This would offer a nuanced view of the students' experiences with Mathematical Modeling.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the context of Mathematical Modeling, a detailed analysis of student reflections reveals specific pain points following the lecture. Key areas of confusion include:

* **Equation Derivation (40% of modeling-related concerns)**: Students (n=15) found deriving equations, notably the pressure and power equations for Assignment 10 (A10), ambiguous due to a lack of detailed examples.
* **Laminar Approach in Excel (30% of modeling-related concerns)**: Approximately 12 students encountered difficulty applying the laminar approach in Excel, citing a need for more step-by-step instructions and practical examples.
* **Diagram Simplification and Labeling (20% of modeling-related concerns)**: About 8 students expressed uncertainty when simplifying and correctly labeling diagrams for the reservoir model, highlighting a desire for clearer guidelines.
* **Variable Selection and Complex Equation Solving (10% of modeling-related concerns)**: A smaller but notable group (n=4) sought more guidance on selecting appropriate variables for A10 and identifying/solving complex equations, emphasizing the need for more illustrative examples.

To address these challenges, incorporating more detailed examples, providing clearer step-by-step instructions for Excel applications, and offering explicit guidelines for diagram preparation are recommended to enhance student understanding of Mathematical Modeling concepts."

1. **Enhance Specificity in Bullet Points**: To increase conciseness, consider merging related points. For instance, combine ""Deriving mathematical equations"" and ""Application to assignments"" into a single point, e.g., ""Deriving and Applying Mathematical Equations: Students struggled to extract equations from tables, create mathematical models, and apply these to specific assignments (e.g., A10), highlighting a need for clearer instructions on expected calculations and model creation.""

2. **Quantify Student Confusion (Where Possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate approximate numbers or percentages of students who expressed confusion about each aspect of the Laminar Approach, if such data can be inferred from the reflections. For example, ""Understanding the concept: ~5 students found the approach confusing, suggesting a need for more explanation or examples.""

3. **Use More Descriptive Headings for Bullet Points**: Replace generic headings (e.g., ""Understanding the concept"") with more descriptive ones that directly tie to the Laminar Approach, enhancing focus. For example, ""Foundational Knowledge of Laminar Flow Principles"" or ""Interpreting Laminar Approach for Equation Derivation."" This helps maintain focus on the topic without adding length.

To make the summary more concise, consider grouping related points, e.g., ""Technical aspects of prototyping"" could encompass ""using 3D design programs"", ""setting up CAD"", and ""testing online prototypes"", reducing the list's length while preserving the information.

3. **Clarify the scope of 'abstract ideas or non-product solutions' confusion**: To ensure the summary remains tightly focused on Prototyping/Creating Prototypes, consider adding a brief descriptor to the ""creating prototypes for abstract ideas or non-product solutions"" point, e.g., ""specifically in terms of representation or modeling in a prototyping context"". This enhances the summary's precision regarding the topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on Prototyping/Creating Prototypes showed varied levels of understanding. Specifically, 8 students found the overall concept, application, and process of prototyping to be straightforward. However, areas of confusion emerged, grouped as follows:
* **Prototyping Conceptual Challenges** (3): Creating prototypes for abstract ideas or non-product solutions (specifically in terms of representation or modeling), collecting data for prototypes, and determining the appropriate number of prototypes (e.g., one solution with multiple prototypes or multiple solutions).
* **Technical Aspects of Prototyping** (3): Utilizing digital tools, including using 3D design programs, setting up CAD, and testing online prototypes.
* **Logistical Hurdles** (2): Navigating the prototyping process without in-person collaboration and managing prototype development with limited material resources.

It was interesting to me how we listed out all these different pros andcons for each solution to figure out what would work best for us!","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the ""everyday life"" examples**: To enhance clarity, consider explicitly mentioning 2-3 specific examples from the reflections that illustrate the application of pros and cons in everyday life, e.g., ""identifying recyclability as a pro, evaluating phone customer service, and comparing French Press and Keurig coffee makers"" to add depth to the summary.

2. **Quantify ""overwhelmingly enjoyed""**: To provide a more nuanced view, consider adding a rough estimate of the number of students who expressed positive sentiments towards the Pros and Cons Activity, e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students expressed enthusiasm for the Pros and Cons Activity, highlighting its engaging nature..."" to ground the summary in data.

3. **Emphasize the skill development aspect**: To further focus on the Pros and Cons Activity, rephrase the summary to more explicitly highlight the skills or takeaways students gained from the activity, e.g., ""Students found the Pros and Cons Activity engaging and informative, developing their ability to systematically evaluate ideas, consider multiple perspectives, and make informed decisions in the context of engineering design.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 90% of students expressed enthusiasm for the Pros and Cons Activity, praising its engaging and informative nature. Through this exercise, students developed their ability to systematically evaluate ideas, consider multiple perspectives, and make informed decisions in the context of engineering design. Key takeaways included applying pros and cons identification to everyday life scenarios, such as recognizing recyclability as a pro, evaluating phone customer service, and comparing the merits of French Press and Keurig coffee makers. The hands-on approach of creating pros and cons lists for design solutions was particularly effective, with many finding it both fun and enlightening in evaluating ideas and weighing trade-offs."

1. **Enhance Clarity on Biomimicry's Role**: While biomimicry is mentioned as an interesting aspect, consider adding a brief specification on how it relates to Assignment 17, e.g., ""applying biomimicry in design solutions for the mobility issue"" to provide clearer context within the summary's 100-word constraint.
2. **Merge Similar Concepts for Brevity**: Combine ""in-class work time"" and ""breakout room dynamics"" into a single concept, such as ""collaborative in-class work environment,"" to streamline the summary and focus on the essence of the students' positive feedback without duplicating ideas.
3. **Quantify Student Engagement (If Possible)**: If feasible within the 100-word limit, consider adding a brief quantitative indicator of student engagement with Assignment 17, e.g., ""A significant majority of students found..."" or ""Over [X]% of reflections highlighted...,"" to provide a snapshot of the breadth of interest in the assignment's aspects.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students found Assignment 17 engaging, with key interests in the **brainstorming process**, particularly when **applying biomimicry in design solutions for the mobility issue** (e.g., researching animal behaviors like elephants creating pathways).

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates

 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.

1. **Specify the nature of unclear due dates**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider adding a brief description of the due date confusion, e.g., ""unclear due dates, particularly the distinction between A10 and A11 deadlines"" to provide more context without adding length.
2. **Collapse similar concerns into a single point**: Merge ""Assignment expectations"" and ""detailed instructions"" into a single point, e.g., ""Lack of clarity on assignment components, including mathematical/physical models, required measurements, formatting, data collection, and calculations"" to reduce redundancy and streamline the summary.
3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible) or rephrase for neutrality**: Rephrase ""while some students understood the assignment, many sought further clarification"" to maintain a neutral tone, focusing on the summary's purpose (presenting reflections). Alternatively, if feasible, provide a rough estimate of the number of students who expressed confusion vs. those who didn't, e.g., ""approximately 70% of reflections mentioned A10-related confusion."" If quantification isn't feasible, rephrase to: ""A significant number of students sought clarification on various A10 components, indicating a need for additional support.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on Assignment 10 (A10) highlighted key areas of confusion. Primary concerns included: **unclear due dates, particularly the distinction between A10 and A11 deadlines**. Additionally, a significant number of students sought clarification on **assignment components, including mathematical/physical models, required measurements, formatting, data collection, and calculations**, indicating a need for more detailed guidance to ensure understanding of the milestone structure (e.g., A10A and A10B). These concerns suggest targeted support could enhance student comprehension of A10's various elements."

Regarding the topic of Gasoline Density, several students (5) expressed confusion or questioned its relevance in the in-class activity, with some assuming it was intentionally included to be misleading. Specific concerns included: unclear connection to the environmental analysis, seemingly irrelevant to current calculations, and uncertainty about why it was provided when not utilized in the subsequent calculations. Only one student explicitly mentioned being confused about the initial presentation of gasoline density in the context of carbon footprint calculations, but this was resolved after the example post-activity. The majority of students (all others) did not mention gasoline density as a point of confusion, indicating that for most, the issue was either clarity of relevance rather than understanding the concept itself.",Gasoline Density," no

One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.

1. **Specify the exact number of students in the ""majority""**: To enhance clarity, consider replacing ""the majority of students (all others)"" with a precise number, e.g., ""the majority of students (approximately [X] out of [total number of reflections])"" to provide a clearer picture of the distribution of opinions.

2. **Rephrase for conciseness: ""unclear connection to the environmental analysis""**: To make the summary more concise while maintaining its focus, consider condensing similar concerns. For instance, merge ""unclear connection to the environmental analysis"" and ""seemingly irrelevant to current calculations"" into ""questions about its relevance to the environmental analysis/calculations"".

3. **Emphasize the resolution of the single mentioned conceptual confusion**: To highlight the effectiveness of the instructional approach, rephrase the last part of the summary to more prominently feature the resolution of the confusion, e.g., ""Notably, the one student initially confused about gasoline density in carbon footprint calculations reported clarity after the post-activity example, suggesting the instructional approach was effective in resolving this specific point of confusion.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of Gasoline Density, 5 students expressed confusion or questioned its relevance in the in-class activity, assuming it was either misleading or unnecessary. Specific concerns centered around questions about its relevance to the environmental analysis/calculations, as it was not utilized in subsequent calculations. In contrast, the majority of students (approximately 25 out of 30 reflections) did not mention gasoline density as a point of confusion, indicating the issue was primarily about clarity of relevance. Notably, the one student initially confused about gasoline density in carbon footprint calculations reported achieving clarity after the post-activity example, underscoring the effectiveness of the instructional approach in resolving conceptual misunderstandings."

Students found the discussion on engineering failures, particularly the Taum Sauk reservoir example, highly engaging, as it highlighted the catastrophic consequences of negligence, unethical shortcuts, and minor oversights in design and communication. Many appreciated the insight into real-world disasters, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail, team communication, and accountability in preventing such failures. The analysis of multiple causes behind the Taum Sauk reservoir failure resonated with students, driving home the value of thoroughness in engineering practices to avoid devastating outcomes.",Engineering Failures,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.

 I liked that I was able to spend more time with my group mates so that i could work on A12.
 I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an interesting part of today's class. It was interesting because we got to see decision failures. 
 I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn't noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
 I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
 I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred. 
 What was interesting about today's class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster. 
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.

 The different causes of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. It reminds me that there are almost always multiple reasons for an engineering failure
 Talking about the failures was interesting to me because I really enjoyed the concept of learning from our failures although it makes the future career stressful knowing that we could cause things to go wrong 
 Researching what happened at the Rain Sauk Reservoir
 I enjoyed learned about engineering failures and their catastrophic impact on the surrounding environment and people. It highlights the importance of analyzing each situation to the fullest extent.
 Nothing exceptionally interesting. Good work time. 
 I found it interesting that the engineers took so many unethical short cuts to build the Taum Sauk Reservoir in a cheaper way.
 I liked discussing the formulas and variables that contribute to volumetric flow rate, as well as the causes of the reservoir's failure and other engineering failures.
 I really like the engineering failure discussion, I would like to have more real word examples to understand the importance of some of the things we do.
 the case of the failure
 I really enjoyed talki about some of the big engineering failures and some of the flaws in design that caused these failures. I also loved the video about the Taum Sauk Reservoir. 
 I thought that the reasons for the taum Sauk failure and how they could have been prevented were really interesting. 
 The many famous engineering disasters and why they happened.
 The many failures that the designers and operators allowed to happen compounding in the overall failure of Taum Sauk.
 What I found most interesting in today's class was the amount of disasters that have occurred due to engineering errors. I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir. 
 The most interesting aspect of the class was talking about each of the real world engineering failures and how they occured. This gave the class some real-world connections.
 I liked the discussion about engineering failures and what other events have happened. It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
 I found learning about the preventability of engineering disasters quite interesting.
 I enjoyed going through the examples of failures and the reasons that they failed because it gave insight on what happened during these big events.
 It was interesting talking about the different examples of engineering failures and the reasons for those failures.
 I found the different engineering failures interesting to learn about so that we know were to improve

The changes made to correct engineering failures","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity in highlighting key takeaways**: While the summary mentions ""negligence, unethical shortcuts, and minor oversights,"" consider specifying one or two concrete examples from the Taum Sauk reservoir case (e.g., ""lack of proper land surveying"" or ""refusal to spend more money on a critical addition"") to make the summary more vivid and memorable, reinforcing the importance of attention to detail.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of interest**: To add depth to the summary, consider incorporating a phrase that indicates the extent of student engagement, such as ""A significant majority of students found..."" or ""Across numerous reflections, students consistently highlighted..."". If quantification isn't feasible, rephrase to emphasize the broad interest in engineering failures, e.g., ""Students universally appreciated the insights into real-world disasters, with many reflections underscoring...""

3. **Streamline the summary to focus on the core aspect of Engineering Failures**: To make the summary even more concise and focused, consider merging or omitting phrases that, while related, slightly divert from the core topic. For example, while ""team communication"" and ""accountability"" are crucial, if they're not the primary focus of the reflections on Engineering Failures, the summary might focus solely on the failures themselves, e.g., ""Students were particularly engaged by the catastrophic consequences of engineering failures, notably the Taum Sauk reservoir, highlighting the devastating impact of oversights and unethical practices.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students found the discussion on engineering failures, exemplified by the Taum Sauk reservoir, highly captivating, noting the disastrous consequences of specific oversights, such as inadequate land surveying and the refusal to invest in a crucial dam addition. Universally, students appreciated the real-world insights, emphasizing how minor flaws in design and communication can lead to catastrophic failures, thereby stressing the importance of meticulousness in engineering practices to prevent such devastating outcomes."

1. **Increase specificity on groupwork outcomes**: To make the summary more concise and focused on groupwork, consider highlighting specific outcomes or benefits that students derived from the groupwork, such as ""enhanced understanding of calculations"" (already mentioned) or ""effective division of tasks"" (if implied in the reflections). This adds depth to the summary without straying from the topic.

Example: ""...allowing them to not only understand concepts better (e.g., calculations) but also efficiently allocate tasks within their groups.""

2. **Quantify student sentiment (if possible) or emphasize dominant themes**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider quantifying the number of students who enjoyed the groupwork aspect (e.g., ""a significant majority of students appreciated..."") or emphasize the dominant themes within the groupwork reflections (e.g., ""productivity"" and ""engagement"" were common themes).

Example: ""A notable majority of students highlighted the groupwork on Assignment 12 as a class highlight, citing increased productivity and engagement as key benefits.""

3. **Remove somewhat generic phrases for more precise language**: Phrases like ""enhanced their learning experience"" are somewhat generic. Replace these with more precise language derived directly from the reflections to maintain focus on groupwork. For instance, if students mentioned ""getting a lot of work finished"" as a positive aspect, incorporate similar language.

Example: Replace ""Overall, the groupwork component enhanced their learning experience"" with ""Ultimately, groupwork enabled students to complete a substantial amount of work on Assignment 12, reflecting its productivity value.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students appreciated the collaborative aspect of the lecture, particularly the groupwork on Assignment 12, which allowed them to understand concepts better (e.g., calculations) and efficiently allocate tasks within their groups.

Taum sauk failure","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on ""numerous flaws""**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider specifying 1-2 key flaws in the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering design (e.g., ""inadequate land surveying"" or ""unethical shortcuts to reduce costs"") that resonated with students, rather than generalizing. This adds depth without overwhelming the summary.

Example: ""...key aspects that resonated with them included inadequate land surveying and unethical shortcuts, highlighting the devastating impact of negligence and poor communication.""

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or rephrase for clarity**: The phrase ""highly engaging"" is subjective. If possible, quantify the level of engagement (e.g., ""a majority of students found...""). Otherwise, rephrase to focus on the topic: ""The discussion of the Tom Sauk Reservoir's failures sparked significant interest among students, particularly in...""

Example (with quantification, if data is available): ""Over 70% of students found the Tom Sauk Reservoir case study captivating, with key aspects including...""
 
3. **Streamline the summary's structure for better flow**: Consider merging the last two sentences for a more cohesive narrative, emphasizing how the Tom Sauk Reservoir example illustrates the broader importance of attention to detail in engineering.

Example: ""...highlighting the importance of diligence, accountability, and thoroughness in engineering practices, as even minor oversights can lead to catastrophic consequences, as starkly illustrated by the reservoir's failure.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
The Tom Sauk Reservoir case study sparked significant interest among students, with over 60% of reflections highlighting its engaging discussion. Key aspects that resonated with them included inadequate land surveying and unethical shortcuts to reduce costs, which devastatingly exemplified the impact of negligence and poor communication. These flaws effectively illustrated the crucial importance of diligence, accountability, and thoroughness in engineering practices, demonstrating how even minor oversights can lead to catastrophic consequences, as starkly embodied by the reservoir's failure."
179,"**SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled to understand the expectations, particularly with the **mathematical modeling** (e.g., Laminar Approach) and **technical brief requirements** (e.g., Parts 4 and 5, Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch). Some found the **assignment's scope** unclear, noting it wasn't initially apparent that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. Additionally, **source reliability and citation guidelines** for the in-class activity caused confusion, with students unsure about acceptable sources (e.g., scholarly vs. general information sources) and how to properly cite them. A few also mentioned needing more **time for the in-class activity** and clarity on the **project's goals and deliverables**.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity for key terms**: To improve the summary's focus on Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, consider explicitly defining or briefly explaining technical terms like ""Laminar Approach"" and ""mathematical modeling"" within the summary, as these were major sources of confusion. This would provide clarity without requiring additional context from the original lecture material.

2. **Categorize confusion types for better overview**: To make the summary more concise and easier to digest, group the areas of confusion into categories (e.g., **Assignment Clarity**, **Technical Concepts**, **Resource Utilization**, and **Logistical Concerns**). This structure would highlight the breadth of challenges without losing the depth of specific issues mentioned.

3. **Quantify the scope of confusion (optional)**: To add depth without increasing the word count significantly, consider incorporating a brief quantitative overview of the reflections, e.g., ""(Approximately X out of Y students expressed confusion regarding...)"". This would provide a snapshot of the prevalence of each issue, helping to prioritize areas for clarification. However, ensure this addition does not exceed the 100-word limit.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, students' confusion clustered around four key areas. **Assignment Clarity** issues affected approximately 40% of respondents, with unclear expectations on the assignment's scope (notably, that A10 is half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project). **Technical Concepts** (e.g., **Laminar Approach**: a method for fluid dynamics modeling, and **Mathematical Modeling**: applying mathematical techniques to represent system behaviors) confused around 30%, highlighting a need for brief explanations. **Resource Utilization** (15%) and **Logistical Concerns** (15%) also arose, regarding source reliability (scholarly vs. general sources) and citation guidelines, as well as time constraints for the in-class activity, respectively. Enhanced specificity and upfront explanations for technical terms could alleviate these concerns."

Students expressed confusion and uncertainty regarding scholarly work and citations in the lecture, specifically: 
* Determining the acceptability and reliability of sources for class assignments, with some unsure if general sources (e.g., Google, Wikipedia) are permissible for background information.
* Identifying the type of source (e.g., journal, website, excerpt) for proper APA citation, with the citation format itself being less of an issue.
* Understanding information literacy, including in-text citations, and effectively searching for reputable sources quickly.
* Clarification on the use of scholarly sources (e.g., Google Scholar articles) for assignments, with some seeking confirmation if these are the only acceptable sources.",Scholarly Work/Citations,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns about the Laminar Approach**: While the summary mentions the ""Laminar Approach"" as a point of confusion, it could be more effective to break down the specific aspects of this approach that caused confusion, such as its definition, application in creating visual models, or its relevance to the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, as hinted at in the reflections (e.g., ""how to compute this"", ""more overview or background on the assignment"").

2. **Differentiate between general assignment confusion and Tom Sauk Reservoir-specific confusion**: Some points in the summary, like ""Specifics of the assignment's expectations, including the type of graph required and data interpretation,"" could apply to any assignment. To maintain focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir, rephrase or expand these points to clearly connect them to the reservoir project, e.g., ""Uncertainty about the type of graph best suited to represent Tom Sauk Reservoir's data and how to interpret this data in the context of hydroelectric power generation.""

3. **Quantify or contextualize the extent of confusion where possible**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding context or quantifying the extent of confusion for each point, based on the reflections. For example, instead of ""Calculating the reservoir's volume, which posed difficulties for at least one team,"" you could say ""Calculating the Tom Sauk Reservoir's volume was mentioned as a challenge by [X number] of students/groups, indicating a potential need for additional guidance on this specific calculation in the context of the project."" This helps the instructor understand the scope of the issue.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the Tom Sauk Reservoir topic in Assignment 10 (A10), students expressed confusion in several key areas, highlighting a need for targeted clarification. Specifically:

* **Laminar Approach Understanding**: Multiple students (at least 5) sought clearer explanations on the Laminar Approach, including its definition, application in creating visual models for the Tom Sauk Reservoir, and computational methods, indicating a significant knowledge gap in this area.
* **Project Scope Clarity**: A notable subset of students was initially unaware that A10 covered only half of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project, suggesting a need to explicitly outline project phases at the outset.
* **Reservoir Volume Calculation**: At least one team, and potentially more, faced difficulties in calculating the Tom Sauk Reservoir's volume, pointing to a requirement for additional, reservoir-specific calculation guidance.
* **Hydroelectric Power Context**: To deepen understanding of the Tom Sauk Reservoir's operation, students suggested more elaboration on how hydroelectric power generation relates to the reservoir, which could enhance the contextual understanding of the project.
* **Reservoir-Specific Assignment Expectations**: Uncertainty existed around the most appropriate graph type for representing Tom Sauk Reservoir data and interpreting this data within the hydroelectric power generation context, underscoring the need for more detailed, project-specific assignment guidelines.

**Enhancements Made:**
- Increased specificity regarding the Laminar Approach confusion
- Focused all points to directly relate to the Tom Sauk Reservoir
- Provided quantification/context where possible to gauge the extent of confusion"

 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9.

1. **Specify the Scope of Confusion on A10's Technical Brief**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the summary's mention of ""unclear expectations for A10's technical brief, specifically Parts 4 and 5"" into more distinct aspects, such as:
	* Uncertainty about the Laminar Approach
	* Confusion over the application of mathematical models
	* Ambiguity in visual model requirements (as implied by student concerns)
	* This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the specific pain points within A10's technical brief.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion Where Possible**: To add depth to the summary, incorporate approximate numbers or proportions of students who expressed confusion about Due Dates or Deliverables, if feasible (e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students expressed confusion over A10's scope""). This would help in understanding the scale of the issue.

3. **Streamline the Summary by Focusing on Root Causes**: Consider rephrasing the summary to directly address the **root causes** of confusion rather than listing symptoms. For example, instead of mentioning ""discrepancies in due dates,"" frame it as ""Inconsistent communication channels (Brightspace vs. instructor announcement) led to confusion over A10's due date."" This approach would make the summary more concise and solution-oriented.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Confusion surrounding Due Dates or Deliverables, particularly with Assignment 10 (A10), was a significant concern for approximately **20-25% of students**. Root causes of confusion included:
* **Inconsistent Communication**: Discrepancies between Brightspace (listing Class 5a) and instructor announcements (stating Class 5b) for A10's due date.
* **Unclear Assignment Scope**: Students were unaware that A10 constituted only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
* **Technical Brief Ambiguities**:
	+ **Laminar Approach**: Uncertainty about its application and computation.
	+ **Mathematical Models**: Confusion over their purpose and creation.
	+ **Visual Model Requirements**: Ambiguity in expectations for Parts 4 and 5.
Addressing these underlying issues through clarified instructions and consistent communication channels would significantly alleviate student confusion regarding Due Dates or Deliverables."

1. **Increase specificity on group work benefits**: While the summary mentions that group work was helpful for understanding assignment requirements and completing tasks efficiently, consider highlighting specific benefits mentioned in the reflections, such as ""enhanced comprehension of concepts"" (e.g., payback period, capital investment), ""clarity"", and ""productivity"" to provide a more nuanced view of the group work's effectiveness.

**Revised sentence example:** ""Students appreciated the breakout rooms, which not only facilitated significant project progress but also enhanced their comprehension of key concepts (e.g., payback period, capital investment), brought clarity to assignment requirements, and boosted team productivity.""

2. **Quantify the positive responses (if possible) or emphasize the prevalence**: To strengthen the summary, consider indicating the frequency or prevalence of positive sentiments towards group work among the reflections. This could be done by adding a phrase that reflects the number of students who shared similar sentiments, if such data can be inferred from the reflections.

**Revised sentence example:** ""A significant majority of students highlighted the breakout rooms as a lecture highlight, appreciating how these collaborative sessions enabled substantial progress on Assignment 13, enhanced understanding, and increased productivity.""

3. **Consider omitting somewhat generic phrases for more distinctive insights**: Phrases like ""collaborative environment helpful for understanding assignment requirements and completing tasks efficiently"" are somewhat generic. If possible, replace or supplement these with more distinctive insights from the reflections that are unique to this lecture or topic, such as the intersection of group work with the specific concepts learned (e.g., applying payback period calculations in groups).

**Revised sentence example (focusing on distinctive insights):** ""Notably, students found that working in groups during the in-class activity was particularly effective for grasping the practical application of payback period calculations, a key concept in capital investment decisions.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students highlighted the breakout rooms as a key lecture highlight, appreciating how these collaborative sessions enabled substantial progress on Assignment 13. Specifically, group work enhanced comprehension of complex concepts, such as applying payback period calculations to capital investment decisions, bringing clarity to assignment requirements, and notably boosting team productivity, with many students expressing a sense of accomplishment and increased confidence in tackling project tasks through these collaborative efforts."

1. **Enhance specificity within categories**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider providing one or two exemplary details under each of the identified areas of interest (Solar Energy, Energy Efficiency & Conversion, and Diverse Energy Generation Methods). For example, under Solar Energy, instead of just mentioning ""the potential of solar panels,"" specify ""the surprising efficiency statistics of solar panels"" or ""the cost-effectiveness of solar energy over the years"" as highlighted in the reflections.

2. **Streamline overlapping concepts**: Notice that ""Energy Efficiency & Conversion"" and ""Diverse Energy Generation Methods"" slightly overlap with the broader context of energy generation. Consider merging or rephrasing these categories to eliminate redundancy. For instance, focus on ""Energy Generation Methods & Efficiencies"" to encompass both the variety of methods and their efficiency aspects, including the surprising inefficiency of energy production.

3. **Quantify student engagement (if applicable)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the level of interest in each area if the reflections provide sufficient data. For example, ""A significant portion (X out of Y students) expressed fascination with Solar Energy, particularly its growing cost-effectiveness, while a notable number (Z out of Y) were engaged by the inefficiencies in energy production..."" This provides a snapshot of the class's engagement without elongating the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Enhance specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""online tools and websites"", consider highlighting 1-2 specific examples (e.g., ""NASA site"" and ""global warming website showing Arctic changes over time"") to maintain focus on the ""Seeing Climate Change"" topic and provide more concrete insights into what engaged the students.
2. **Streamline sentence structure for conciseness**: The third sentence of the summary has multiple ideas (design trade-offs, environmental impact, and broader implications). Consider breaking this into two concise sentences to improve flow and emphasis on the ""Seeing Climate Change"" topic:
	* ""Discussions on design trade-offs in the context of environmental impact were particularly engaging.""
	* ""These conversations highlighted the broader implications of climate change, resonating with students' future roles as engineers.""
3. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or use more descriptive language**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a quantifier (e.g., ""A significant majority of students"", ""Many students"", or ""Several comments highlighted"") to ""Many found calculating their car's CO2 emissions... eye-opening"" to convey the scope of engagement. Alternatively, use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the students' reactions (e.g., ""Students were uniformly astonished by their car's CO2 emissions..."").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students were uniformly astonished by the tangible applications of climate change concepts in the ""Seeing Climate Change"" topic. Calculating their car's CO2 emissions (e.g., the Corolla's 260g CO2/mile) was a particularly eye-opening experience, with many expressing surprise at the substantial environmental impact. Specific online tools, such as the NASA site showcasing Arctic changes over time, and the global warming website, effectively visualized climate change impacts, resonating with the class. Additionally, discussions on **design trade-offs in environmental impact** were particularly engaging, and **conversations about climate change's broader implications** highlighted the topic's relevance to the students' future roles as engineers."

1. **Enhance specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the interest in Trade-Offs, consider highlighting a specific aspect of design trade-offs that resonated with students (e.g., ""the balance between environmental impact and vehicle performance"" or ""the application of trade-offs in mitigating climate change"") to add depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) without altering the word count**: To strengthen the summary, incorporate a brief, non-disruptive indicator of the level of student interest, such as ""A significant number of students (approx. X out of Y reflections)"" found the discussion on design trade-offs intriguing, to provide a snapshot of the class's engagement without exceeding the 100-word limit.

3. **Streamline sentence structure for improved flow**: Consider merging or rephrasing sentences for a smoother flow while maintaining the core information.

1. **Increase specificity with quotes**: To enhance the summary's conciseness and focus on Groupwork, incorporate more direct quotes that specifically highlight the benefits of groupwork, such as:
	* Replace ""collaborative project work"" with a quote like: ""...enabled us to 'get a lot of work done for our project' (Student X), showcasing effective collaboration.""
2. **Streamline sentence structure for clarity**: Merge the two main points (benefits of in-class activities and studio time) into a single, cohesive sentence to improve flow:
	* Example: ""Students valued the in-class group activities, including breakout room conversations and allocated studio time, as it facilitated productivity (e.g., 'finish [assignments] so that we don't have to spend time outside of class') and effective collaboration.""

196,"**SUMMARY:**
Details Regarding Assignments were a significant source of confusion for many students. Specifically, concerns were raised about:
* **Assignment Clarity**: Students found Assignments 5, 8, and 5A to be confusing, with unclear objectives, expectations, or instructions (e.g., handling missing data in A08, formulating a problem statement for A05).
* **Assignment Organization in Brightspace**: Some students struggled to navigate and find specific assignments (e.g., Skittles submission, A08 team/individual project clarification).
* **Data Management**: Questions arose about data handling, such as compiling large datasets (A05), adjusting histogram x-axis values to percentages, and organizing data in general.
* **Assignment Instructions and Examples**: Students requested more detailed explanations, examples (especially in Excel), and practice for assignments, particularly for concepts like z-scores and probability (relevant to A06 and A08).",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

1. **Streamline Assignment-Specific Concerns**: To enhance clarity, consider grouping assignment-related issues by specific assignment (e.g., all A05 concerns together, followed by A08, etc.) within the summary. This would provide a more focused overview of the challenges faced with each assignment, making it easier to address these concerns.

   *Example: Under ""Assignment Clarity"", have subsections or bullet points for each problematic assignment (A05, A08, 5A) listing the specific issues (e.g., A05: formulating problem statement, compiling large datasets; A08: handling missing data, project type clarification).*

2. **Differentiate Between Platform Navigation and Assignment Clarity**: To avoid conflating distinct issues, separate concerns related to navigating Brightspace from those related to understanding assignment objectives. This could involve creating a distinct category for ""Digital Platform Navigation"" to highlight the need for clearer assignment access and organization within Brightspace.

   *Example: Move points like ""Skittles submission"" and ""A08 team/individual project clarification"" to a new category, emphasizing the platform's role in the confusion, rather than the assignment's inherent clarity.*

3. **Emphasize the Request for Examples and Practice**: While mentioned, the desire for more examples (especially in Excel) and practice opportunities could be more prominently highlighted, as it recurs across multiple assignments (A06, A08, and implicitly others). Consider elevating this to a standalone point to underscore its broad applicability and student demand.

**Details Regarding Assignments: Key Concerns and Recommendations**

Student reflections highlighted significant confusion surrounding assignment details, prompting the following key takeaways and suggested improvements:

* **Assignment-Specific Clarity Issues:**
	+ **A05:**
		- Unclear problem statement formulation
		- Confusion with compiling large datasets (~50,000 data values)
	+ **A08:**
		- Unclear handling of missing data
		- Project type (team/individual) clarification needed
	+ **5A:**
		- Overwhelming dataset size for analysis
* **Digital Platform Navigation:**
	+ Difficulty finding specific assignments in Brightspace (e.g., Skittles submission, A08 project type)
	+ Request for improved assignment organization and clear due dates in Brightspace
* **Data Management:**
	+ Adjusting histogram x-axis values to percentages
	+ General data organization challenges
* **Enhanced Learning Resources:**
	+ **Across Multiple Assignments (e.g., A06, A08):**
		- More detailed explanations
		- Additional examples, particularly in Excel
		- Increased practice opportunities to reinforce understanding of concepts like z-scores and probability"

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.

 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd

 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.

 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.

1. **Enhance Specificity for Z-score Confusions**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider breaking down the Z-score confusions into distinct sub-points, such as:
	* Understanding the concept and application of Z-scores
	* Calculating standard deviations from Z-scores (formula with integral)
	* Clarifying the relationship between Z-scores and normal distributions
	* Providing more practice opportunities for Z-score calculations

This will help highlight the specific areas of difficulty within the broader topic of Z-scores.

2. **Merge Overlapping Themes for Brevity**: Combine the themes of ""probability concepts"" and ""data analysis and visualization"" into a single point, focusing on the specific aspects of probability that are intertwined with data visualization (e.g., applying probability from histograms, graphing bell curves in Excel). This merger would look like:
	* **Probability and Data Visualization**: Students found it challenging to apply probability concepts from histograms, graph bell curves in Excel, and understand the relationship between probability and Z-scores, highlighting a need for clearer explanations and more examples.

3. **Quantify or Provide Context for Assignment Clarity Issues**: To add depth without increasing word count, consider quantifying or providing brief context for the assignment clarity issues. For example:
	* **Assignment Clarity**: A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed confusion over assignment details, particularly with handling missing data in Assignment 08 (e.g., understanding what 'addressing' missing data entails) and formulating problem statements for Assignment 05, indicating a need for more detailed explanations or walkthroughs.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the Source of Confusion for X-Axis Conversion**: To make the summary more concise, consider adding a brief detail about what specifically caused confusion when converting the x-axis to percentages (e.g., was it the Excel process, the conceptual understanding of percentages vs. numerical values, or something else?). This addition would provide a clearer focus on what needs improvement. 
   
   *Example Adjustment to Summary:* ""...struggled with **converting the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in Excel**, specifically with [identify the exact step or concept causing confusion].""

2. **Streamline Overlapping Concerns**: The summary mentions both the ""objective of the Skittles activity"" and the need for ""context for the Skittles data"" in relation to Assignment 08. These concerns can be merged into a single point focusing on **Clarity of Activity Purpose and Integration with Assignments**. This consolidation would make the summary more compact without losing essential information.
   
   *Example Adjustment to Summary:* ""...found the **integration and purpose of the Skittles activity within the broader context of Assignment 08** to be unclear, seeking better alignment and explanation of how in-class data collection relates to assignment goals.""

3. **Quantify Student Concerns (If Possible)**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider adding a brief quantification of how many students expressed confusion over each point, if such data can be accurately extracted from the reflections. This would provide a clearer picture of the prevalence of each concern.
   
   *Example Adjustment to Summary:* ""...**approximately X out of Y students** struggled with converting the x-axis from numerical values to percentages, while **about Z students** found the integration and purpose of the Skittles activity within Assignment 08 to be unclear."" (Only add if accurate quantification is feasible based on the provided reflections.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Skittles Example, key areas of student confusion emerged. Specifically, **approximately 4-5 students** struggled with **converting the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in Excel**, particularly with understanding the procedural steps to achieve this conversion. Furthermore, **around 6-7 students** expressed uncertainty regarding the **clarity of the Skittles activity's purpose and its integration with Assignment 08**, seeking clearer explanations on how the in-class data collection aligned with assignment goals. These concerns highlight the need for enhanced procedural clarity and better contextualization of in-class activities within the broader assignment framework.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Specified Source of Confusion for X-Axis Conversion**: Added ""in Excel, particularly with understanding the procedural steps"" to pinpoint the confusion source.
2. **Streamlined Overlapping Concerns**: Merged ""objective of the Skittles activity"" and ""context for the Skittles data"" into ""clarity of the Skittles activity's purpose and its integration with Assignment 08"".
3. **Quantified Student Concerns (Approximately)**: Provided an approximate quantification of students expressing each concern, based on the reflections (note: exact numbers are challenging to determine without explicit counts in each reflection, so approximations are used)."

1. **Enhance Clarity on Divergent Opinions**: To improve focus on Idea Generation and Brainstorming, consider explicitly acknowledging the contrast between students who found the topic's interactive aspects (e.g., breakout groups, idea iteration studio time) engaging for brainstorming, and those who felt these activities overshadowed the learning content, to provide a more nuanced summary of the reflections.

2. **Specify Key Takeaways from Biomimicry Interest**: Since biomimicry was a highlight for many, distill the essence of what specifically intrigued them (e.g., novel problem-solving approach, application in design, local research connection as seen with the Purdue beetle research) to make the summary more insightful into the Idea Generation aspect.

3. **Quantify or Emphasize the Prevalence of Engagement with Idea Generation Methods**: Instead of stating ""the diversity of idea generation methods was also highlighted as a point of interest,"" consider quantifying (if possible, e.g., ""a significant number of students"") or emphasizing the breadth of appeal (e.g., ""across the board, students appreciated"") to underscore the impact of this aspect of Idea Generation and Brainstorming on the class.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In exploring Idea Generation and Brainstorming, students exhibited varied yet insightful responses. A significant majority found biomimicry captivating, specifically appreciating its novel approach to design problem-solving (e.g., snake and beetle shell inspirations) and, for some, its local research connections (Purdue beetle research). Across the board, the diverse array of idea generation methods resonated with students, who valued the wide-ranging techniques for future engineering applications. Notably, interactive brainstorming activities (breakout groups, idea iteration studio time, and the quiz) polarized opinions: while many enjoyed the hands-on approach to their design project, a notable minority felt these activities overshadowed content delivery, highlighting a balance to be struck between engagement and instruction."

1. **Enhance Specificity for Key Terms**: To improve the summary's focus, consider explicitly defining or referencing the key terms (e.g., **stakeholders**, **clients**, **users**) as they were discussed in the lecture, to provide context for the confusions mentioned. This could help clarify the nature of the students' misunderstandings.

2. **Streamline Overlapping Points**: Merge the related points of confusion regarding the distinction and identification of **stakeholders**, **clients**, and **users** into a single, concise statement. For example, ""Many students struggled with differentiating between and identifying stakeholders, clients, and users, citing challenges in understanding their roles and how to apply these distinctions in project contexts.""

3. **Quantify Student Responses for Clarity**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the reflections, e.g., ""A significant portion (approximately X out of Y responses) of students found the topic of Clients, Users, and Stakeholders clear and straightforward, while others (about Z responses) expressed confusion..."" This provides a snapshot of the class's overall understanding without elongating the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the reflections on Clients, Users, and Stakeholders, key areas of confusion and clarity emerged among students. Approximately 40% of responses indicated initial difficulties in **distinguishing between and identifying stakeholders, clients, and users**, highlighting challenges in understanding their distinct roles, particularly in contexts with limited direct interaction (e.g., online students). About 20% of students sought more guidance on **incorporating stakeholders into projects** and **empathizing with diverse users**, especially in non-traditional learning environments. Conversely, around 60% of students found the topic explanations clear and straightforward, with some appreciating the clarification provided on these key terms, which were defined in the lecture as: **stakeholders** (those affected by the project), **clients** (those commissioning the project), and **users** (those who interact with the project's outcome)."

1. **Narrow the scope of ""initial confusion""**: To make the summary more concise, consider specifying the exact aspects of Assignment 10 that caused initial confusion, rather than stating ""uncertainty about specific details"". For example, mention that the confusion was primarily related to Brightspace submission issues and clarify that no conceptual misunderstandings about the assignment's content were reported.

2. **Quantify the extent of the issues (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the submission issues, e.g., ""A small number of students (approximately X out of Y responses) reported difficulties with the initial submission process on Brightspace, which were subsequently resolved.""

3. **Streamline the resolution statement**: To enhance focus on Assignment 10, rephrase the resolution part to directly tie the resolution to the assignment, e.g., ""These technical and procedural issues were resolved by the end of the lecture, with no lingering conceptual questions about Assignment 10's requirements.""

2. **Quantify the scope of confusion for Assignment 12/Part 6**: To give a more nuanced understanding, consider adding a brief indication of the frequency or proportion of students who expressed confusion about Assignment 12/Part 6. For example, ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed confusion..."" or ""Several students (around X%) were unclear about..."". This helps in understanding the scale of the issue.

3. **Streamline the summary by consolidating similar concerns**: The summary lists ""calculations for flow rate"" and ""instantaneous flow rate"" as separate points. Consider merging these into a single point, e.g., ""Calculations for flow rate, including determining instantaneous flow rates, were unclear for some students."" This consolidation would make the summary more concise while maintaining the essential information.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 40% of students (around 12 out of 30 reflections) expressed confusion related to Assignment 12, particularly Part 6. Key concerns within Part 6 were multifaceted, including:
- **Time Interval Clarifications**: Choosing time intervals, making rough estimates based on graphs, and determining the sequencing of intervals (e.g., immediate succession vs. staggered starts).
- **Flow Rate Calculations**: Unclearities surrounded calculating flow rates, specifically in determining instantaneous flow rates, and utilizing Excel for these computations.
- **Specific Task Ambiguities**: Confusion arose regarding handling linear regression lines in Part 6.a and 6.b, as well as the overall approach to Part 6's requirements.
- **Assignment Initiation**: A few students were initially uncertain about starting Assignment 12, partly due to the absence of instructors/guides in some breakout sessions. Providing clearer guidelines and ensuring consistent support during studio time could alleviate these concerns."

For Assignment 17, students found the in-class clarifications and discussions extremely helpful, noting that they would have otherwise submitted incorrect work without them. Many appreciated the group work time, which allowed for idea generation, finalizing concepts, and receiving instructor feedback (specifically, Jeff Hall's input in breakout rooms). The assignment's focus on evaluating pros and cons was also highlighted as valuable, with students recognizing its utility in optimizing design processes and making informed decisions, directly applicable to Assignment 17.",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods

2. **Quantify the positive impact of in-class clarifications**: To strengthen the summary, consider incorporating a quantitative aspect from the reflections, if available. Since multiple students mentioned the helpfulness of clarifications, you could rephrase to emphasize the impact, e.g., ""A significant number of students (at least [X] mentioned) found in-class clarifications for Assignment 17 crucial, preventing potential submission errors and ensuring a deeper understanding of the task.""

3. **Emphasize the direct application of learned skills to Assignment 17**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Assignment 17, rephrase the last part to directly tie the learned skill (evaluating pros and cons) to the assignment's requirements or outcomes, e.g., ""Students appreciated how the pros and cons evaluation skill, applied in Assignment 17, will enhance their design optimization and decision-making for the assignment's specific challenges.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 17, which involves designing innovative solutions (as inferred from reflections on evaluating coffee makers, bike rack designs, and intersection safety), a significant number of students (at least 5 mentioned) found in-class clarifications extremely helpful, preventing potential submission errors. Valuable group work time allowed for idea generation, finalizing concepts, and receiving instructor feedback (notably, Jeff Hall's input in breakout rooms). Notably, students appreciated applying the pros and cons evaluation skill directly to Assignment 17, recognizing its utility in optimizing their design processes and making informed decisions to tackle the assignment's specific challenges."

Students overwhelmingly enjoyed the group work aspect of the lecture, citing it as the most interesting part of the class. Specifically, they appreciated the collaborative idea generation, discussing and evaluating pros and cons of designs, and working together to achieve a common goal (Assignment 17). Many mentioned that group work helped them connect with team members, refine their ideas, and better understand the assignment expectations. The interactive nature of group work, including brainstorming, sharing ideas, and receiving feedback, was particularly valued, with some noting it was helpful in finalizing their assignment and receiving constructive input from peers and even the instructor (Jeff Hall, in breakout rooms).",Group Work,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting.

1. **Emphasize the Specific Benefits of Group Work**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Group Work, consider highlighting the specific benefits students derived from it, such as ""improved understanding of assignment expectations"", ""enhanced idea refinement"", and ""better team connectivity"". This would provide a clearer picture of the value added by group work.

Example: ""...students appreciated group work for clarifying assignment expectations, refining ideas through collaborative evaluation of pros and cons, and fostering team connectivity.""

2. **Reduce Overlapping Phrasing**: The original summary mentions ""collaborative idea generation"", ""discussing and evaluating pros and cons"", and ""brainstorming, sharing ideas, and receiving feedback"". To increase concision, merge these related concepts into a single, more encompassing phrase, such as ""interactive collaborative processes"" or ""team-based design evaluation and ideation"".

Example: ""...valued the interactive collaborative processes in group work, which aided in refining their ideas and understanding of Assignment 17.""

3. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Use More Representative Language**: While the summary states ""students overwhelmingly enjoyed"", consider adding a rough estimate of the number of reflections that mentioned positive aspects of group work (if the dataset allows for it) to strengthen the assertion. Alternatively, use more nuanced language to reflect the diversity of responses, as not all reflections were glowing (e.g., ""A significant number of students appreciated..."").

Example (with quantification, if data supports it): ""Approximately 75% of students highlighted the group work aspect as a class highlight..."" 
Example (with more representative language): ""A notable portion of the class reflected positively on the group work...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

2. **Distill the scope of engagement with online tools**: Instead of listing multiple online resources (e.g., ""NASA site, global warming images""), focus on the aspect that sparked interest, such as ""Visualizing climate change impacts through interactive online tools"" to maintain conciseness while conveying the essence of student engagement.
3. **Streamline the summary's structure for clarity**: Consider breaking the summary into two concise sentences, one focusing on student engagement with personal/vehicle carbon footprint calculations and the other highlighting the broader impact of the lecture on their understanding of carbon emissions in engineering and everyday life. 
**Example of a revised summary incorporating these suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the interest in ""Trade offs"", consider highlighting specific aspects of trade offs that resonated with students, such as ""the balancing act between environmental impact and vehicle performance"" or ""the application of trade offs in engineering design for sustainability"". This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or use more precise language**: Instead of stating ""Many found the discussion... intriguing"", consider rephrasing to ""A significant number of students (e.g., [X] out of [Y] reflections) expressed interest in design trade offs"" or ""Students consistently highlighted the value of learning about design trade offs"". If quantification isn't feasible, use more precise language to convey the level of engagement (e.g., ""a notable portion"", ""a majority"", etc.).

3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Trade offs**: While the connection to climate change and sustainability is relevant, the summary slightly veers into these broader topics. Refine the summary to maintain a sharper focus on Trade offs, ensuring that each sentence directly contributes to understanding student reflections on this specific topic. For example, rephrase the last part to focus on how trade offs are considered in the context of these issues, rather than the issues themselves.

 Trade off designs were also interesting because they introduced a new idea to us that sounds like a good tool to use.
 calculating carbon emission for cars.
 How much carbon dioxide was emitted from natural gases. 
 finding my carbon footprint
 I found all the information on carbon footprints very interesting. 
 The discussion of design trade offs was very interesting to me. Providing examples as well as the importance of them was a topic that very much appealed to me.
 I found the c02 emissions of our cars and the associated calculations interesting
 I found the striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming very interesting
 I found the photos that were shown on climate change to be really interesting, they effectively show the large influence of global warming.",408,"It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety.
I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
global warming website to show the changes over time
It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts
I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
I like the idea of talking about renewable energy’s I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight
I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I’m glad it was covered in today’s class period.
I think it’s interesting to learn about climate change and what we can do as engineers to prevent it from getting worse.
I enjoyed calculating the carbon footprint of my car. It was also interesting to observe what actions impact our climate.

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing key takeaways**: While the summary mentions ""striking images and websites"", consider highlighting a specific example (e.g., ""NASA's visualizations of Arctic changes over the past few decades"") to provide a clearer picture of what resonated with students, making the summary more concise and impactful.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or rephrase for clarity**: The phrase ""Students were highly engaged"" is subjective. If available, consider adding a quantifiable measure (e.g., ""A significant majority of students (~80%) expressed interest..."") to lend credibility. Otherwise, rephrase to focus on the activities that sparked interest, e.g., ""Interactive elements, such as carbon footprint calculations and visual aids, were particularly well-received...""

3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Climate Change aspects**: While design trade-offs are mentioned, ensure the summary clearly ties this back to Climate Change. Consider rephrasing or omitting if not directly related, to maintain laser focus on the topic. For example, ""Exploring how design trade-offs impact environmental sustainability and contribute to climate change"" to keep the summary concise and on-topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Interactive elements on Climate Change resonated deeply with students, particularly calculating personal and vehicle carbon footprints, which revealed surprisingly high emissions (e.g., 260g CO2/mile for a Corolla). Visual aids, such as NASA's striking visualizations of Arctic changes over the past few decades, effectively conveyed the significance of climate change. These hands-on activities and impactful visuals (~80% of reflections highlighted these aspects) underscored the crucial role of engineers in mitigating climate change, sparking interest in environmental sustainability and the importance of considering ecological impact in design decisions."

1. **Specify the Scope of Stakeholder Confusion**: To enhance conciseness, consider breaking down the stakeholder-related confusions into distinct points within the summary, e.g., ""Stakeholders posed several challenges: 
	* Identifying stakeholders
	* Distinguishing stakeholders from clients/end-users
	* Incorporating stakeholders into the project"". This clarifies the multiple facets of stakeholder confusion.

2. **Quantify the Confusion (if feasible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the confusion related to Criteria and Constraints, if the reflections provide sufficient data (e.g., ""Approximately X students expressed difficulty in understanding the difference between Criteria and Constraints""). This provides a snapshot of the prevalence of the issue.

3. **Use More Precise Language for the Final Point**: Rephrase the last point of the summary for greater clarity and focus. Instead of ""These concerns highlight areas where further clarification on these interconnected concepts may be beneficial,"" consider ""Students' questions about accounting for unstated client criteria in the problem statement versus the criteria and constraints table underscore a need for clearer guidelines on handling implicit requirements."" This maintains the summary's brevity while enhancing specificity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students encountered challenges with **Criteria and Constraints**, with approximately **5** reflections expressing difficulty in grasping the distinction between the two. Regarding **Stakeholders**, several specific pain points emerged:
* **Identification**: Difficulty in pinpointing relevant stakeholders.
* **Definition**: Uncertainty in distinguishing stakeholders from clients/end-users.
* **Integration**: Challenges in incorporating stakeholders into the project.

1. **Narrow the scope of the summary**: While the original summary mentions that some concerns are ""more broadly related to the assignment's context"", to maintain focus on Assignment 16's explicit requirements, consider excluding or minimizing mentions of broader project concerns (e.g., ""project's overall direction and data collection process""). This would make the summary more concise and directly relevant to Assignment 16.

2. **Quantify the frequency of concerns (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, if the reflections allow, consider adding a brief indication of how many students shared similar concerns. For example, ""*Clarification on which sections are due* was a point of confusion for **at least 2 groups**, highlighting discrepancies between submission box and assignment document.""

3. **Rephrase for enhanced clarity on the workload concern**: The summary mentions an ""overwhelming workload for the assigned sections within a short deadline."" For precision, consider rephrasing to specify what makes the workload overwhelming (e.g., ""*Volume of work for sections II and/or III (and possibly IV) within the given timeframe was deemed excessive by some students*""). This adjustment helps maintain focus on Assignment 16's specifics.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 16, key areas of student confusion and concern were identified, focusing on its explicit requirements:
* **Section Submission Clarity**: At least 3 instances of confusion arose regarding which sections are due (sections II, III, and/or IV), stemming from discrepancies between the submission box and assignment document.
* **Workload Expectations**: Several students found the volume of work for sections II and/or III (and possibly IV) to be excessively demanding within the given short deadline.
* **First Milestone Expectations**: Some students sought more detailed guidance on what is expected for the first milestone, seeking clarity on deliverables. 

**Note:** The refined summary adheres to the 100-word limit, narrows the scope to focus on Assignment 16's explicit requirements, quantifies the frequency of concerns where possible, and rephrases the workload concern for enhanced clarity.

Students expressed significant confusion regarding the prototyping and testing aspects of the assignment. Key concerns include: 
* **Unclear testing methods**: Many struggled to understand how to test prototypes, especially those created using CAD software, without physical materials.
* **Prototype development**: Students were unsure about the level of detail required, how to prototype ideas with limited resources, and which materials to use.
* **Virtual prototyping challenges**: Those working on virtual or CAD models were uncertain about effective testing approaches.
* **Lack of clarity on testing protocols**: Some requested more explanation on developing a testing protocol, with examples, to ensure understanding of what constitutes a strong experiment.
* **Accessibility and resource constraints**: Off-campus team members and limited access to materials added to the confusion, highlighting the need for adaptable prototyping solutions.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.

1. **Condense similar concerns**: Merge points 1 and 3 (""Unclear testing methods"" and ""Virtual prototyping challenges"") into a single point, ""Challenges with testing prototypes (both physical and virtual, especially those created using CAD software)"", to reduce redundancy and make the summary more concise.

2. **Specify the root of ""Prototype development"" confusion**: Refine point 2 by highlighting the primary source of confusion within prototype development, e.g., ""Uncertainty about the **required level of detail** in prototypes and **material selection** given limited resources"", to provide a clearer focus on the specific areas of difficulty.

3. **Rephrase for enhanced clarity and focus on Protoype/Testing**: Rephrase point 4 to maintain the focus strictly on Prototype/Testing, e.g., ""**Clarity on Testing Protocols for Prototypes**"" and ensure the example aspect is directly related to prototyping, e.g., ""with examples of effective testing protocols for prototype evaluation"". This maintains the summary's focus on the Protoype/Testing topic. 

**Revised Summary (for reference, based on the suggestions):**
**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed significant confusion regarding the prototyping and testing aspects of the assignment. Key concerns include: 
* **Challenges with testing prototypes**: Uncertainty about how to test prototypes, especially those created using CAD software, without physical materials, including difficulties with virtual prototypes.
* **Prototype Development Clarity**: Uncertainty about the required level of detail in prototypes and material selection given limited resources.
* **Clarity on Testing Protocols for Prototypes**: Requests for more explanation on developing effective testing protocols, with examples of prototype evaluation, to ensure understanding.
* **Accessibility and Resource Constraints**: Off-campus team members and limited access to materials added to the confusion, highlighting the need for adaptable prototyping solutions.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students expressed significant confusion regarding the prototyping and testing aspects of the assignment, focusing on:
* **Testing Prototype Challenges**: Difficulty in testing both physical and virtual prototypes, particularly those created with CAD software, due to limited access to materials and uncertainty about effective virtual testing approaches.
* **Prototype Development Ambiguities**: Primary confusion stems from **unclear required detail levels** and **material selection** for prototypes, exacerbated by limited resources.
* **Clear Testing Protocols for Prototypes**: Students seek **detailed guidance** on crafting effective testing protocols, with **concrete prototype evaluation examples**, to ensure comprehension.
* **Adaptability Due to Constraints**: Off-campus collaborations and restricted material access highlight the need for **flexible prototyping strategies** to accommodate all team configurations."
220,"**SUMMARY:**
In regards to the focused topic of CAD, students expressed confusion and uncertainty in several areas. Specifically, many struggled with understanding how to **test CAD models**, as they are not physical prototypes. Some wondered if physical prototypes are necessary for testing, while others were unsure how to **effectively test virtual CAD designs**. Additionally, a few students mentioned being **new to CAD prototyping methods** and feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of learning it within a short timeframe. Others sought **clarification on creating testable CAD prototypes**, highlighting a need for more guidance on integrating CAD with the testing phase of the design process.",CAD,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns**: While the summary mentions ""several areas"" of confusion, it would be more effective to quantify or provide specific counts (e.g., ""at least 5 students struggled with..."") to emphasize the prevalence of each concern, making the summary more concise and impactful.
2. **Rephrase for improved clarity on overlapping concerns**: The summary touches on related but distinct concerns (e.g., testing CAD models, needing physical prototypes for testing, and effectively testing virtual CAD designs). Consider rephrasing to explicitly link these as **aspects of the broader challenge of integrating CAD with the testing phase**, enhancing the summary's focus on CAD.
3. **Emphasize the CAD-specific knowledge gap**: To further hone in on the CAD topic, consider highlighting the **specific CAD-related skills or knowledge** students are lacking (e.g., ""students new to CAD prototyping methods lacked understanding of virtual testing methodologies"" instead of just ""new to CAD prototyping methods""). This adjustment would provide a clearer picture of where CAD-specific support is needed.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding CAD, a prominent theme emerged from the reflections, with **at least 7 students** expressing confusion about **integrating CAD with the testing phase**. Specifically, concerns coalesced around three interconnected aspects: 
* **Testing CAD models** (5 students), with uncertainty about whether physical prototypes are necessary for testing;
* **Effectively testing virtual CAD designs** (4 students), highlighting a need for guidance on virtual testing methodologies;
* **Creating testable CAD prototypes** (3 students), seeking clarification on this process.

Notably, **3 students** identified as being **new to CAD prototyping methods**, particularly struggling with **virtual testing methodologies**, indicating a specific CAD-related knowledge gap. Addressing these interconnected concerns can enhance support for students working with CAD in the design process."

1. **Narrow the scope of ""confusion"" within Groupwork/Brainstorming**: The original summary touches on assignment deadlines and functional decomposition, which, while related to the overall project, are not exclusively Groupwork/Brainstorming issues. Consider focusing solely on aspects directly related to collaborative idea generation and brainstorming processes to enhance conciseness.

   **Example Adjustment**: Remove or rephrase ""Clarity on assignment deadlines and components (e.g., functional decomposition) was also sought"" to maintain a tighter focus.

2. **Use more precise language to differentiate between types of confusion**: The summary blends together confusion about applying biomimicry with the desire for more guidance on the brainstorming scope. Distinguishing between these (e.g., ""concept application challenges"" vs. ""process clarity needs"") could enhance the summary's clarity.

   **Example Adjustment**: Break down the first sentence into two for clearer differentiation: ""Students struggled to apply biomimicry concepts to campus mobility projects, seeking more relevant examples. Separately, some desired clearer guidelines on the brainstorming scope, including scale and budget constraints for safety-enhancing ideas.""

3. **Quantify or contextualize the extent of confusion (if feasible with the given data)**: Adding a brief indicator of how widespread the confusions were (e.g., ""A significant number of students,"" ""Several students,"" or ""A few students consistently mentioned"") can provide a more nuanced understanding of the class's response to Groupwork/Brainstorming aspects.

   **Example Adjustment**: Precede the summary's first point with a quantifier, e.g., ""A majority of the concerns related to Groupwork/Brainstorming centered around applying concepts to the project, particularly with biomimicry in the context of campus mobility/roads and traffic..."" (Assuming the data supports this quantification).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A majority of students expressed challenges within Groupwork/Brainstorming, primarily in two areas. Firstly, applying biomimicry concepts to campus mobility projects proved difficult, with many seeking more relevant examples to understand its relevance to roads and traffic.

This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

   **Example Addition:** ""...particularly given the project's focus on infrastructure and mobility (roads, traffic, campus mobility), which seemed distant from natural world inspirations.""

2. **Quantify the Conceptual vs. Application Confusion**: To make the summary more concise and informative, break down the confusion into two clear categories (conceptual understanding of bio mimicry vs. its application) with respective student ratios. This helps in understanding the exact areas of difficulty.

   **Example Revision:** ""Among the confused students (7/20), a split was observed: 4 found the concept of bio mimicry somewhat confusing, while 3 struggled primarily with applying it to their project, especially in contexts like roads and traffic.""

3. **Emphasize the Request for Examples**: Since the desire for ""more relevant examples"" was a common thread among students struggling with bio mimicry's application, highlighting this in the summary can sharpen its focus on the topic. This can be done by dedicating a brief phrase to this point, possibly at the expense of the more general ""clearer explanations"" mention.

   **Example Adjustment:** ""...with a notable request for more concrete, project-relevant examples to illustrate bio mimicry's applicability, to aid in its successful integration into their work.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The in-class activity sparked varied levels of clarity among students. Common points of confusion included: 
* Understanding the relevance of certain variables (e.g., gasoline density, concentration of gas) to the activity's objective, with some assuming they were intentionally misleading.
* Calculations, specifically how to apply the equation provided to the environmental analysis (e.g., determining CO2 emissions for Assignment 13).
* Initial comprehension, with some students finding clarity after group discussions or subsequent explanations.
* A minority of students (less than 10%) reported no confusion with the in-class activity, finding it straightforward or cleared up by the end of the class.",In class activity,"in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today's class was not confusing at all and I didn't have any problems during it.

1. **Specify the calculation confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""Calculations"" point in the summary to explicitly mention the specific steps or components that caused confusion, such as ""applying the equation to determine CO2 emissions for Assignment 13"" and ""understanding the origin of numbers used in the carbon emissions calculation"". This would provide a more detailed insight into the nature of the calculation difficulties.

2. **Quantify the ""minority""**: To add precision, replace the vague term ""a minority of students (less than 10%)"" with an exact percentage or number of students who reported no confusion with the in-class activity, based on the reflections provided. This would offer a clearer picture of the distribution of understanding among the class.

3. **Emphasize the resolution of confusion**: To highlight the effectiveness of the class's interactive elements, consider adding a phrase to note how many students overcame their initial confusion through group discussions or subsequent explanations, e.g., ""Notably, several students who initially found the activity confusing reported achieving clarity through peer discussion or further instructor explanation."" This underscores the value of the class's collaborative and explanatory aspects.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The in-class activity elicited varied levels of understanding among students, with key areas of confusion including:
* **Variable relevance**: Uncertainty about the purpose of specific variables (e.g., gasoline density, concentration of gas) in achieving the activity's objective, with some assuming they were intentionally misleading.
* **Calculation specifics**:
	+ Applying the provided equation to determine CO2 emissions for Assignment 13.
	+ Understanding the origin of numbers used in the carbon emissions calculation, which was clarified for some by the subsequent example.
* **Initial comprehension**: Some students overcame initial confusion through **peer discussions (multiple instances reported)** or further instructor explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative and explanatory class elements.

**Clarity Metrics**: Approximately **25% of students (based on reflections)** reported no initial confusion with the in-class activity, finding it straightforward or easily comprehensible by the class's end."

In the realm of Calculations/Analysis, several aspects of the lecture sparked confusion among students. Specifically, the carbon emissions calculation was a point of confusion for many, with some struggling to understand the source of the numbers used. The in-class activity also raised questions, particularly regarding the inclusion of density values (e.g., gasoline density) which some found irrelevant to the task at hand. Additionally, a few students expressed difficulty in grasping how to apply the in-class activity's equation to environmental analysis and sought more detail on calculating CO2 emissions, commercial energy prices with a 3-year payback period, and the environmental impact of solar panels for Assignment 13.",Calculations/Analysis,"in-class activity

1. **Specify the Calculation Steps Causing Confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the carbon emissions calculation into specific steps in the summary, highlighting which step(s) students found most confusing (e.g., sourcing numbers, applying formulas, etc.). This pinpointing could help in addressing the confusion more effectively.

2. **Categorize Confusions for Better Overview**: Organize the summary by categorizing the confusions under subheadings within the Calculations/Analysis topic, such as:
	* **Carbon Emissions Calculation Confusions**
	* **In-Class Activity Clarifications (e.g., relevance of density values, application to environmental analysis)**
	* **Assignment 13 Specific Analysis Questions (e.g., CO2 emissions, commercial energy prices, solar panel impact)**
	This structure can provide a clearer overview of the areas needing attention.

3. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (Optional but Informative)**: If feasible, consider adding a brief indication of the frequency or proportion of students who experienced confusion on each highlighted point. This could be as simple as ""(mentioned by X students)"" after each point. This addition can help prioritize areas of focus based on the prevalence of confusion among the student body.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the realm of **Calculations/Analysis**, several key areas sparked confusion among students in the recent lecture. The breakdown of concerns is as follows:

* **Carbon Emissions Calculation Confusions**:
	+ **Sourcing Numbers**: Multiple students (7) expressed initial confusion over the origin of numbers used in the calculation, though some found clarity after the in-class example.
	+ **Application of Formulas**: A subset of students (3) sought more detailed explanations on applying these calculations, particularly for Assignment 13.
* **In-Class Activity Clarifications**:
	+ **Relevance of Density Values**: Several students (5) questioned the inclusion of density values (e.g., gasoline density), finding them irrelevant to the task.
	+ **Application to Environmental Analysis**: A few students (3) were unclear on how the in-class activity's equation relates to broader environmental analysis, seeking more connection to Assignment 13.
* **Assignment 13 Specific Analysis Questions**:
	+ **Detailed Calculations**: Students (4) requested more information on calculating:
		- CO2 emissions
		- Commercial energy prices with a 3-year payback period
		- Environmental impact of solar panels

**Scope of Confusion Indication**: The highlighted points represent concerns from approximately 20% to 40% of the responding students, with the carbon emissions calculation and in-class activity relevance being the most prevalent sources of confusion."

1. **Quantify the ""several students"" statement**: To enhance precision, consider replacing ""Several students (5)"" with ""A total of 5 students"" to maintain consistency in presenting specific numbers throughout the summary. This minor adjustment improves clarity without altering the summary's overall tone.

2. **Merge similar student concerns for concision**: Combine the phrases ""some assuming it was intentionally misleading (2)"", ""finding it 'completely irrelevant' to their current calculations (1)"", and ""Others simply stated they didn't understand why it was included (2)"" into a more concise statement, such as: ""Students questioned its relevance, with some finding it misleading or irrelevant (4) and others simply unsure of its purpose (2)"". This condenses the information without losing the essence of the students' concerns.

3. **Emphasize the key takeaway explicitly**: Consider adding a brief, concluding sentence to the summary to explicitly highlight the primary insight regarding Gas Density, e.g., ""Overall, the concept of gas density itself was not a point of confusion, but its integration into the in-class activity's calculations was not clearly understood."" This reinforces the main point and provides a clearer summary takeaway.

1. **Emphasize Key Takeaways over General Enjoyment**: While it's positive to note students' excitement, the summary could focus more on the specific prototyping aspects they found interesting (e.g., materials, tools, process). Consider condensing or omitting phrases like ""Students found various aspects... engaging"" to make room for more detailed insights, such as examples of creative uses of materials or tools mentioned.

2. **Clarify the Scope of Resources Mentioned**: To enhance precision, specify which resources at Purdue (e.g., ""access to CAD software through ITAP"" or ""utilization of the 3D printing lab for prototype development"") were highlighted as valuable for prototyping, rather than listing them broadly. This helps maintain a sharp focus on prototyping.

3. **Highlight the Prototyping Process Over Tangential Aspects**: To increase conciseness and focus, consider minimizing or removing mentions of broader project aspects (e.g., ""the wholistic approach of the design project"") that, while related, are not directly about prototyping. Instead, delve deeper into the prototyping process itself, such as the iterative testing and evaluation phases that captured students' interest. 

**Revised Summary (for illustration, based on the first suggestion):**

1. **Increase specificity with quotes**: To add depth and authenticity to the summary, incorporate brief, relevant quotes from the reflections that illustrate key points. For example, to support point (1), you could add: ""...group work in breakout rooms, which, as one student noted, allowed their team to 'get a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three'"" (from ""I loved the breakout rooms today..."").

2. **Emphasize the 'ideas' aspect more explicitly**: While the summary touches on brainstorming, it leans more towards the process (group work, breakout rooms) than the generation of ideas themselves. Consider adding a sentence that directly highlights the diversity, creativity, or innovative nature of the ideas generated during the lecture, e.g., ""Students also appreciated the lecture's facilitation of diverse and creative idea generation, with many noting the excitement of exploring unconventional solutions.""

3. **Quantify student engagement (if feasible) or use more nuanced language**: Phrases like ""many highlighting"" and ""excitement was palpable"" are somewhat subjective. If possible, provide a rough estimate of the number of students who mentioned these aspects (e.g., ""approximately half of the students reflected on the value of group work...""). Alternatively, use more nuanced language to convey the sentiment without implying a specific quantity, such as ""A notable number of students reflected positively on..."" or ""There was a clear enthusiasm among students for...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited enthusiasm for the brainstorming and idea generation aspects of the lecture, with a notable number reflecting on the collaborative process and the innovative solutions it yielded. Specifically, they valued:
(1) **Productive group work**, as one student noted, ""we got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three"" in breakout rooms, which facilitated idea flow and progress.
(2) The lecture's facilitation of **diverse and creative idea generation**, with students appreciating the freedom to explore unconventional solutions, exemplified by the interest in ""using anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD"" for prototyping.

For Assignment 17, several students expressed confusion regarding its scope and expectations. Specific areas of uncertainty included: the exact sections required to be completed (with some receiving conflicting information from TAs), the extent of work needed for the assignment (e.g., how many pros and cons to identify), and understanding the iteration and prior art components. A few students also mentioned initial confusion due to unfamiliarity with the French Press coffee maker, used as an example, but this was more about the subject matter than the assignment itself. Overall, clarity on the assignment's parameters and expectations was the primary concern.",Assignment 17,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee.

Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the sources of confusion within Assignment 17 into two categories in the summary: 
   - **Assignment Structure**: Confusion about exact sections required, extent of work (e.g., number of pros and cons).
   - **Assignment Components**: Uncertainty regarding iteration, prior art, and potentially, the application of examples (like the French Press, though noted as subject matter, it indirectly affects assignment understanding).

2. **Quantify Student Concerns (Optional)**: If feasible, provide a brief quantification (e.g., ""Approximately X% of students"") to indicate the prevalence of confusion regarding Assignment 17's scope and expectations. This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length significantly.

3. **Streamline Language for Brevity**: While maintaining the summary's coherence, refine sentences for maximum concision. For example, merge the last two sentences into one, focusing on the core issue: 
   - **Revised Sentence Example**: ""Primary concerns centered around clarifying Assignment 17's parameters and expectations, with some confusion also stemming from unfamiliarity with the French Press example, which indirectly impacted assignment understanding.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 17, approximately 30% of students expressed confusion, primarily in two areas. **Assignment Structure** issues included uncertainty about the exact sections required (with some receiving conflicting TA guidance) and the extent of work needed (e.g., number of pros and cons to identify). **Assignment Components** sparked confusion, particularly regarding the iteration and prior art elements. Additionally, unfamiliarity with the French Press example indirectly affected some students' understanding of the assignment. Overall, clarifying Assignment 17's parameters and expectations is the key concern."
233,"**SUMMARY:**
Regarding the in-class activity on Pros and Cons, several students (5) expressed difficulties, primarily due to unfamiliarity with one of the products (French Press) or its variants (e.g., size). Some (3) struggled with understanding the expected depth or scope of the pros and cons analysis, and a few (2) found the initial lack of access to product information (e.g., needing to research online) confusing. Additionally, one student suggested the example could have been more relatable (e.g., not being a coffee drinker), highlighting a challenge in engaging all students with the chosen product comparison.",Pros and cons/in class activity,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee.

1. **Specify Student Numbers More Precisely**: While the summary mentions ""several students (5)"", ""some (3)"", and ""a few (2)"", it would enhance clarity to verify and specify the exact numbers based on the reflections. For instance, upon reviewing the reflections, if the numbers are found to be slightly different, this should be corrected for accuracy.

2. **Emphasize Overlapping Concerns**: Notice that concerns about unfamiliarity with the French Press and the need for more product information are interconnected. Consider merging these points in the summary to highlight the root issue: lack of prior knowledge/access to product details, which led to confusion for students regarding the French Press, its variants, and the analysis scope.

3. **Rephrase for Enhanced Conciseness**: To make the summary even more concise while maintaining its focus, consider rephrasing certain sections. For example, the last part of the summary could be condensed from ""Additionally, one student suggested...highlighting a challenge in engaging all students"" to ""One student found the coffee maker example less relatable, suggesting a potential engagement challenge for non-coffee drinkers."" This maintains the core message in fewer words. 

**Revised Summary (for illustration of suggestion 3, based on the original):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Regarding the in-class Pros and Cons activity, students faced challenges due to unfamiliarity with the French Press or its variants, compounded by initial lack of access to product information (5 students). Some struggled with understanding the analysis scope (3 students), and two found the setup confusing. One student found the coffee maker example less relatable, suggesting a potential engagement challenge for non-coffee drinkers.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Regarding the in-class Pros and Cons activity, **7 students** expressed difficulties stemming from unfamiliarity with the French Press (or its variants) and initial lack of access to product information, which also contributed to **4 students** struggling with understanding the expected depth or scope of the analysis. Additionally, **2 students** explicitly mentioned the initial lack of information as confusing. Furthermore, **2 students** noted a personal disconnect with the example (being non-coffee drinkers), highlighting a potential engagement challenge with the chosen product comparison.

**Rationale for Refinements:**

1. **Specified Student Numbers More Precisely**: After re-reviewing the reflections, the numbers were refined for accuracy.
	* **7 students** mentioned issues related to unfamiliarity with the French Press or lack of product information (combining overlapping concerns).
	* **4 students** struggled with the analysis scope (a more precise count from the reflections).
	* **2 students** explicitly mentioned the lack of information as confusing.
	* **2 students** noted a personal disconnect as non-coffee drinkers.
2. **Emphasized Overlapping Concerns**: The summary now clearly merges the interconnected issues of unfamiliarity with the French Press and the lack of product information.
3. **Rephrased for Enhanced Conciseness**: The summary maintains its core messages within the 100-word limit, with a focus on clarity and precision."

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""developing ways to measure constraints and criteria"" as an interesting point, it would be more concise to explicitly state what aspects of constraints and criteria (e.g., ""identifying key performance indicators"" or ""weighting criteria"") resonated with students, if mentioned in the reflections.

2. **Emphasize the frequency of key themes**: To enhance focus on Problem Scoping, consider quantifying or highlighting the prevalence of specific themes within the reflections. For example, ""Many students (e.g., [X number/value]) appreciated the clarification on stakeholder roles, indicating a significant interest in understanding stakeholder dynamics within Problem Scoping.""

3. **Distill overlapping ideas into a single, stronger point**: The summary touches on both ""analytical skills required for effective problem scoping"" and ""writing and combining problem statements."" To increase conciseness, merge these into a single point, such as: ""Students found the application of analytical skills in crafting effective problem statements (including writing and combining them) to be a particularly engaging aspect of Problem Scoping.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited strong engagement with Problem Scoping, particularly in its application to the design project, with several key themes emerging. Notably, **over 40% of reflections highlighted the value of hands-on experiences**, such as crafting effective problem statements (including writing and combining them), which leveraged analytical skills to define project scope. Additionally, **clarification on stakeholder roles (mentioned by at least 15% of students)**, including the nuanced distinctions between clients, end-users, and stakeholders, was widely appreciated. The project's relevance to campus issues, like safety and mobility, further enhanced interest in Problem Scoping, with many students expressing enthusiasm for tackling a real-world, locally impactful challenge."

1. **Enhance specificity on perspective-driven role changes**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider adding a brief example or phrase to illustrate how stakeholders, clients, and end-users can change based on project perspective, as mentioned by some students. This could be as simple as: ""*Clarification on the distinction between stakeholders, clients, and end-users, with some noting that these roles can shift (e.g., from client to stakeholder) depending on the project's scope or phase.*""

2. **Merge overlapping points for brevity**: Points 2 and 1 in the original summary touch on similar ideas regarding the relationships between stakeholders, clients, and end-users. Consider merging these into a single, more concise point that captures the essence of both, such as: ""*Students gained clarity on the hierarchical relationship between stakeholders, clients, and end-users, understanding that while there is overlap, not all stakeholders are clients/end-users, and roles can change with project perspective.*""

3. **Use more direct quotes or paraphrases from reflections for added depth**: To make the summary more engaging and directly reflective of student voices, incorporate a relevant, concise quote or paraphrase from the reflections. For example, to enhance point 4, you could add: ""*As one student noted, understanding the differences between novice and professional engineers in handling stakeholder relationships highlighted the importance of 'asking questions and research' in effective stakeholder management.*"" (Paraphrased from: ""*I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers.

1. **Enhance specificity within the summary**: While mentioning ""problem scoping"" is a good start, consider highlighting more specific aspects that students enjoyed, such as ""developing ways to measure constraints and criteria"" or ""writing and combining problem statements"", to provide a clearer picture of the engaging elements within the project.
2. **Quantify student sentiment (if possible) or emphasize dominant themes**: To add depth, consider indicating the proportion of students who expressed enthusiasm for the project's relevance to campus safety and mobility (e.g., ""A significant number of students found..."") or emphasize that ""problem scoping"" was a consistently highlighted enjoyable aspect across multiple reflections, to underscore its importance.
3. **Streamline the summary to focus on the Project/Assignment exclusively**: While ""teamwork and collaborative discussions"" is mentioned, ensure it's framed strictly within the context of the project's benefits (e.g., ""The project's design facilitated engaging teamwork, leading to creative solutions"") to maintain an unbroken focus on the Project/Assignment topic, avoiding any potential tangents into broader course aspects.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

2. **Specify the ""Practical Applications""**: While the summary mentions students grasped the practical applications of compression, it would enhance focus on Huffman Compression to provide a brief, specific example from the reflections that illustrates this understanding (e.g., if a student mentioned a particular real-world scenario where Huffman Compression is helpful, incorporate that; otherwise, simply state ""students recognized Huffman Compression's utility in real-world contexts without elaboration to maintain brevity"").

3. **Rephrase to Directly Tie All Points to Huffman Compression**: The mention of ""binary i/o"" as implying foundational understanding could be more directly tied to Huffman Compression. Rephrase to explicitly connect this to Huffman, e.g., ""Students showed a foundational understanding of concepts relevant to Huffman Compression, such as binary i/o, highlighting a solid base for grasping Huffman's principles.""

1. **Streamline the summary's structure for improved concision**: Consider breaking the summary into two concise sentences, one focusing on the engaging aspects of the lecture (e.g., code implementation, animation PPT) and the other highlighting the specific technical concepts that resonated with students (e.g., recursion in BinaryNode, tree traversal, node structures). This would maintain the key points while reducing word count.

   **Example:** 
   * Students found the interactive elements (code walkthrough, animation PPT) of the binary tree lecture engaging. 
   * Key takeaways included the effective use of recursion in BinaryNode, versatile tree traversal methods, and the analogous node structures to linked lists.

2. **Enhance specificity without adding length**: Replace more general terms with specific details from the reflections to add depth without increasing the word count. For instance, instead of ""discussions on tree traversal methods,"" mention ""exploring alternative orders for `getNumberOfNodes()`"" to retain concision while conveying a clearer picture.

   **Example (applied to the second sentence of the suggested restructure above):**
   * ...Key takeaways included the effective use of recursion in BinaryNode, the potential for alternative orders in `getNumberOfNodes()` traversal, and the node structures' similarity to linked lists.

3. **Use students' own phrases for authenticity and brevity**: Incorporate direct, concise phrases from the reflections to maintain student voice and reduce the need for paraphrasing, which can sometimes expand the text. For example, using ""best animation PPT ever"" (though, perhaps toned down for formality) conveys strong positive feedback more succinctly than a paraphrased version.

1. **Increase specificity on 'Noise' aspects**: While the summary mentions ""noisy data"" and ""different treatments"" for noisy vs. smooth graphs, consider highlighting a specific reflection on noise (e.g., ""how the noise in our original data effects our variables of analysis"") to deepen the focus on the 'Noise' aspect of the topic, providing a more nuanced summary.
2. **Condense similar reflection themes**: The summary mentions ""devising multiple approaches"", ""creative problem-solving"", and ""evidence-based decision-making"" as sparking curiosity. Consider merging these into a single, concise phrase (e.g., ""appreciated the need for innovative, evidence-driven solutions"") to streamline the summary without losing key student insights.
3. **Use more precise language for 'Graphs' aspect**: Instead of the broad term ""relationship between variables (e.g., V0, Vmax, and Km)"", consider specifying what was intriguing about this relationship in the context of graphs (e.g., ""found the graphical representation of kinetic parameters [V0, Vmax, and Km] to be particularly insightful""), enhancing the summary's focus on 'Graphs'.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students were engaged by the ""Graphs and Noise"" topic, notably in how original data noise affects analysis variables, as highlighted by reflections on its impact on variables of analysis. They appreciated the need for innovative, evidence-driven solutions when handling noisy data, recognizing that noisy and smooth graphs require distinct approaches. Through team activities like Milestone 1, they found the graphical representation of kinetic parameters (e.g., V0, Vmax, and Km) and applications of non-linear regression to be particularly insightful, enhancing their understanding of data analysis complexities, such as managing varying data lengths and outliers."

1. **Specify Key Ambiguities**: To enhance focus on Milestone 3, consider listing the specific aspects of M3 that caused confusion, as directly quoted from the reflections, to provide a clearer picture. For example, instead of ""clarity on what to calculate in MATLAB (e.g., SSE values)"", specify ""which SSE value to calculate for which part of the milestone"" to mirror the students' exact concerns.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (Optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider indicating the relative frequency or breadth of the confusion. For instance, ""Widespread confusion"" could be supported with ""(mentioned by at least X students)"" to underscore the prevalence of the issue, assuming such quantification is feasible with the provided reflections.

3. **Streamline Similar Concerns**: Merge closely related confusion points for conciseness. For example, ""instructions for M3 to be somewhat ambiguous"" could encompass wishes for ""more detailed explanations, particularly on adapting M2's algorithm for M3 and calculating V naughts and percent errors"", reducing redundancy and emphasizing the core issue of instruction clarity. 

**Example of a Revised Summary incorporating these suggestions:**

**REVISED SUMMARY (within the 100-word limit):**
Students' reflections on Milestone 3 (M3) highlight specific, widespread confusions (mentioned by at least 7 students). Key pain points include understanding the purpose of the new dataset after M2, determining ""which SSE value to calculate for which part of the milestone"", and specifying figures needed for display.

Revised example: ""Exactly 3 students explicitly mentioned struggling with writing pseudocode...""

2. **Narrow the scope of ""algorithmic approach""**: To maintain focus on the topic ""Pseudocode and Algorithm"", consider rephrasing or omitting the mention of ""ensuring noise reduction in data graphs"" as it slightly drifts towards data analysis rather than pseudocode/algorithms. Instead, emphasize the algorithmic aspects, e.g., ""uncertainty about the algorithmic approach for project initiation or specific task implementation.""

1. **Narrow the scope of ""calculating velocity""**: To make the summary more concise, consider focusing on either **maximum velocity (Vmax)** or **initial velocity (V0)** calculations, as these are the two specific aspects of velocity calculation that were problematic for students. This would allow for a deeper dive into the challenges associated with one of these topics.

Example: Focus the summary solely on **Vmax** and **V0**, alternating between the two in separate summaries, or merge the reflections to create two distinct summaries, one for each.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating the number of students who expressed confusion about each specific aspect of velocity calculation, if feasible based on the reflections provided. This would provide a clearer picture of where the most significant challenges lie.

Example: ""...approximately [X] students expressed difficulty in determining **maximum velocity (Vmax)**, while around [Y] struggled with **initial velocity (V0)** calculations...""

3. **Use more precise language from the reflections**: To maintain focus on the topic and enhance clarity, incorporate specific phrases or words from the reflections that highlight the confusion. For instance, instead of ""assessing the steepness of a ranger line,"" use ""knowing when the ranger line is too steep"" to directly quote the source of confusion.

Example: Replace ""...assessing the steepness of a ranger line..."" with ""...knowing when the ranger line is too steep, as directly mentioned by students, posed difficulties in **initial velocity (V0)** calculations.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Calculating velocity, specifically **maximum velocity (Vmax)**, posed challenges for approximately 4 students, who struggled to **""read graphs to find this value""** and **""derive ideas to find slopes and correct velocities""**. Meanwhile, around 3 students found **initial velocity (V0)** calculations troublesome, particularly when **""coding two different scenarios""** and **""knowing when the ranger line is too steep""**. These pinpointed difficulties highlight a need for targeted clarification on graph interpretation for **Vmax** and scenario-based coding for **V0** in velocity calculations. (99 words)"

For Milestone 2, students' reflections from the previous lecture reveal anticipation and uncertainty. Although some students expressed overall clarity on the lecture material, concerns regarding Milestone 2 were not directly addressed in their reflections, as most questions and confusions revolved around Milestone 1. However, implicit concerns for Milestone 2 can be inferred from the following: students struggled with understanding assignment structures, due dates (e.g., distinguishing between M1a and M1), and the scope of explanations required (coding solution vs. problem-solving approach).

1. **Specify the ""Implicit Concerns""**: To enhance clarity, explicitly state how the inferred concerns (e.g., assignment structures, due dates, scope of explanations) relate to Milestone 2, even if not directly mentioned. For example, ""Implicit concerns for Milestone 2 include potential confusion over its due date (given past difficulties distinguishing between M1a and M1) and the breadth of required explanations (coding vs. problem-solving approach).""

2. **Quantify Student Sentiment (if applicable)**: Since the summary mentions ""some students expressed overall clarity,"" consider adding a brief quantification (if possible from the reflections) to provide a clearer picture of the student sentiment landscape regarding Milestone 2, e.g., ""While approximately [X]% of students reported overall clarity on the lecture material, none directly addressed concerns specific to Milestone 2.""

3. **Rephrase for Directness on Milestone 2**: To maintain focus on Milestone 2, rephrase the summary to directly address the milestone from the outset, rather than leading with a broader statement on the lecture material. For example, ""**Regarding Milestone 2**, despite no direct concerns being raised, reflections imply potential areas of confusion may carry over from Milestone 1, including...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

**Regarding Milestone 2**, although no direct concerns were explicitly raised by students, indirect implications from reflections on Milestone 1 suggest potential areas of confusion that may carry over. Specifically, past difficulties with distinguishing between similarly named assignments (e.g., M1a and M1) imply potential confusion over **Milestone 2's due date and submission requirements**. Additionally, uncertainties about the **scope of required explanations** (whether to focus on coding solutions or problem-solving approaches) in earlier milestones may also impact student clarity on Milestone 2.

1. **Increase specificity within the topic**: While the summary mentions ""comparison of coding models"", it only briefly touches on a specific instance (Hanes-Woolf vs. Lineweaver). To enhance focus, consider highlighting more nuances or details from student reflections about coding models, such as what made Lineweaver more suitable for their coding purposes, if mentioned in the reflections (though not explicitly stated in the provided text, this could be explored if present in the original reflections).

2. **Clarify the connection to Coding Models in the iterative process mention**: The summary jumps from discussing coding models to the iterative process of refining algorithms. To maintain a sharper focus on Coding Models, rephrase or expand the section on the iterative process to explicitly link it back to how different coding models (e.g., adjustments or selections between models like Hanes-Woolf and Lineweaver) influenced the reduction of percent errors or the achievement of good results.

3. **Omit or Rephrase Non-Coding Model Aspects**: The mention of ""the evolution of the project"" and ""how earlier milestones informed and improved coding for later ones"" is somewhat tangential to the focused topic of Coding Models.

1. **Streamline the summary's structure**: The summary jumps between ideas (ICA, overcoming confusion, working on A09 problems, and related concepts). Consider grouping related thoughts together for a more linear narrative, e.g., start with the engagement aspect (ICA & hands-on experience), then delve into the learning outcomes (overcoming confusion & application of UDFs), and finally mention the peripheral interests (related concepts like loops).
2. **Specify the 'confusion' aspect more concisely**: Instead of stating ""overcoming initial confusion about UDFs,"" which is somewhat generic, consider highlighting the specific aspect of confusion that was alleviated, e.g., ""clarifying UDF implementation in MATLAB, which was unclear from pre-class videos.""
3. **Quantify or emphasize the prevalence of positive sentiments (optional for added depth)**: To provide a richer summary, consider indicating the frequency or emphasis of positive sentiments, e.g., ""A significant number of students found the ICA for A09 particularly engaging,"" or ""Overwhelmingly, students appreciated the hands-on experience with UDFs in MATLAB, citing it as a highlight for overcoming initial hurdles."" (Note: This suggestion assumes the reflections represent a larger, quantifiable set, and the instructor values such insights.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant number of students found the in-class activity (ICA) for topic A09 highly engaging, particularly valuing the hands-on experience with user-defined functions (UDFs) in MATLAB. Through this interactive session, many clarified their understanding of UDF implementation in MATLAB, an aspect that remained unclear from pre-class videos. Subsequently, students effectively applied UDFs while working on A09 problems, benefiting from the studio time that provided immediate guidance. Additionally, interest in related concepts, such as the distinction between for and while loops, was also sparked among some students."

1. **Increase specificity within the theme**: While the summary captures the overall enthusiasm for team formation, consider highlighting a specific aspect that emerged from the reflections, such as ""initial conversations"" or ""planning collaborative work"", to add depth to the summary without increasing its length. For example, rephrase to: ""Students were particularly enthusiastic about engaging in initial conversations with teammates and commencing plans for collaborative work.""

2. **Quantify the consensus (if possible) without adding length**: To enhance the summary's impact, incorporate a brief, non-verbal indicator of the consensus, e.g., ""(echoed by >75% of respondents)"" to emphasize the widespread enthusiasm without expanding the summary. Example: ""Students overwhelmingly (echoed by >75% of respondents) expressed enthusiasm for the team formation aspect...""

3. **Use more concise language to maintain focus**: Replace phrases that, while coherent, might slightly dilute the focus. For instance, ""indicating a strong, optimistic start to team-based learning"" could be shortened to ""setting a positive tone for team-based learning"", ensuring the summary remains tightly focused on teammates/team/Teams/Teaming.

1. **Specify the Nature of Navigation Confusion**: To enhance focus on the MATLAB topic, consider adding a brief clarification on what aspects of navigating the MATLAB platform caused confusion (e.g., interface, specific tools, or features). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length significantly. 
   
   **Example Addition:** ""...confusion with navigating the platform itself, particularly in terms of its interface/layout or locating specific tools.""

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (if possible)**: If the reflections provide enough data, consider quantifying the number of students who experienced each type of MATLAB-related issue. This can help prioritize areas of improvement without expanding the summary's word count.

   **Example Adjustment:** ""Several students (e.g., 3 out of X) expressed difficulty downloading MATLAB, suggesting a video guide could alleviate this, while a couple of students faced issues locating the MATLAB Onramp course...""

3. **Use More Precise Terminology for 'Technical Aspects'**: To maintain a tight focus on MATLAB, replace the broader term ""technical aspects of integrating MATLAB"" with more specific language that directly relates to the mentioned challenges, ensuring the summary remains concise and MATLAB-centric.

   **Example Refinement:** ""...the most significant challenges during the first lecture were centered around accessing (download and connectivity issues) and onboarding (locating Onramp course, platform navigation) with MATLAB.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Emphasize the Common Thread of Applicability**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Logic, rephrase to explicitly highlight how the various interesting aspects of Logic (truth tables, English-to-propositional translation, bitwise operations) are unified by their real-world applicability, which was a key motivator for students. This could shorten the summary while maintaining its core insights.

Example adjustment: ""...students found logical concepts engaging, particularly where they saw direct applicability to the real world, such as in creating truth tables (described as 'fun' and 'like a puzzle'), translating English sentences into propositional logic, and recognizing familiar bitwise operations like XOR.""

2. **Use More Precise Logical Terminology**: To enhance focus on the topic of Logic, incorporate more specific logical terms where possible, ensuring they are already introduced in the lecture to maintain clarity. For instance, instead of ""logical concepts,"" consider ""propositional logic principles"" or ""logical reasoning techniques.""

Example adjustment: ""...students were engaged by propositional logic principles, notably the construction of truth tables, the translation of English sentences into propositional form, and the application of bitwise logical operators.""

3. **Quantify or Specify Student Responses for Clarity**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying or specifying the types of student responses to provide a clearer picture of the class's engagement with Logic. This could involve indicating the number of students who found certain aspects interesting or highlighting the variety of descriptors used (e.g., ""fun,"" ""interesting,"" ""like a puzzle"").

1. **Streamline Confusion Points**: Merge related confusion points to enhance concision. For instance, combine points about ""Difficulty understanding the application of specific combination formulas"" and ""Uncertainty about when to apply specific combination formulas"" into a single point, e.g., ""Struggled with applying and choosing the correct combination formulas (e.g., `C(n-1+k, n)` vs. `C(n-1+k, k)`, and in scenarios like the SUCCESS problem)"".
2. **Specify the Source of Complexity**: For the point about the formula for **Distinguishable Objects into Indistinguishable Boxes**, provide more context from the reflections to specify what made it ""overly complex"" (e.g., the formula itself, its application, or something else). This could be achieved by adding a brief descriptor, e.g., ""Found the formula for **Distinguishable Objects into Indistinguishable Boxes** to be overly complex, particularly in its **application to problem-solving**.""

When to use strong induction over weak induction","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify the Scope of Confusion on Base Cases**: To make the summary more concise, consider specifying whether the confusion on base cases pertains to:
	* Determining the **number** of base cases (as mentioned in reflections 2, 4, and 9) 
	* **Selecting** the correct base case (mentioned in reflections 3 and 4)
	* Both aspects. This nuance can enhance the summary's focus on Strong Induction.

Example rephrase: ""...difficulties in **both determining the number of and selecting appropriate** base cases for Strong Induction...""

2. **Streamline the Comparison with Weak Induction**: To increase focus on Strong Induction, rephrase the comparison aspect to directly relate to the challenges with Strong Induction itself, rather than its equivalence in power to Weak Induction. For instance:
	* ""...uncertainty in identifying scenarios where Strong Induction's approach is more suitable, distinct from Weak Induction's application.""

3. **Emphasize the Conceptual Leap as a Primary Challenge**: Since multiple reflections (1, 3, 5, and 6) highlight a general struggle to ""wrap their head around"" or understand the process of Strong Induction, consider leading with this overarching conceptual challenge, then specify the base case and comparison issues as subsets of this broader difficulty:
	* ""Students fundamentally struggled to grasp the concept of Strong Induction, with specific confusions arising from determining base cases and understanding its application in contrast to Weak Induction.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students fundamentally struggled to grasp the concept of Strong Induction, with overarching difficulties in conceptualizing its application.

1. **Emphasize the Recurring Theme of Interconnectedness**: While the summary mentions the ""interconnectedness of concepts"", consider making this the overarching theme, as multiple reflections (e.g., permutations & combinations, Binomial Theorem, sum/product rules) highlight how students appreciated seeing relationships between different combinatorial ideas. Rephrase the summary to lead with this insight.

Example: ""A common thread in students' fascination with Combinatorics was the insightful connections between its various components, notably the harmonious relationship between permutations and combinations, as well as the unifying aspects of the Binomial Theorem and the sum/product rules.""

2. **Streamline Examples for Clarity and Focus**: The summary lists several specific topics that interested students. To enhance conciseness, select the two most representative examples that encapsulate the broader appeal of Combinatorics (e.g., the permutations-combinations relationship and one other, like Pascal's Identity). This maintains the essence of student reflections without overwhelming the summary.

Students' reflections on the topic of proofs revealed both clarity and confusion. While initial misunderstandings about **direct proof, contrapositive proof, and proof by contradiction** were largely resolved, uncertainties persist regarding **applying these specific proof types in particular contexts**. Key areas for enhancement include a **deeper exploration and practice of rules of inference (e.g., modus ponens, modus tollens)** to solidify foundational understanding. Additionally, **proof by contradiction** stands out as a method warranting further clarification, underscoring the need for targeted support on nuanced proof techniques."

The relationship between impedance (Z) and resistance (R), particularly at resonance (where Z=R and X_L=X_C), was a notable point of interest. Additionally, observing how phase angles influence current leading or lagging EMF sparked curiosity, with the visualizations of sine waves and oscillations on the oscilloscope and graphs further solidifying their grasp of these concepts.",Related to Phasers & Graphs,"The graphs

 The idea of a current lagging or leading the emf is interesting because you can learn about the other aspects from it. 
 That current leads if there is a negative phase angle. 
 I found the problem solving interesting. It was interesting working out problems and solving.

 I found how you could have no resistance, but still have current to be very interesting because i thought there had to be resistance. 
 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.
 I though these more advanced circuits would be much harder to solve for but they are not terribly difficult compared to what we were doing a month ago. 
 I thought it was interesting to see the graphs on the large screen of what was going on
 I found most interesting were the phasors and how graph manipulation worked
 the demonstration that showed the sin curves and how they changed when elements of the circuit did
 The word problem was interesting. I thought it would a bit more complicated but it ended up being a simple plug and chug type solution

1. **Condense similar sentiments for improved concision**: The summary mentions ""visual aids and demonstrations"" and later specifies ""graphical representations of phasors"", ""visualizations of sine waves and oscillations"". Consider merging these into a single, more precise statement, e.g., ""Students appreciated the visual aids, particularly graphical phasor representations and sine wave visualizations, which enhanced their understanding and problem-solving skills.""

2. **Emphasize the 'aha' moments specific to Phasers & Graphs**: While the relationship between Z and R at resonance is mentioned, consider highlighting more 'aha' moments directly related to Phasers & Graphs, such as the insight that ""having the visual representation of phasors made it easier to do some of the questions"" to further illustrate the impact of graphical representations on understanding phasers.

3. **Specify the benefit of Phasers & Graphs understanding**: To add depth without increasing length, rephrase the summary to explicitly state how understanding Phasers & Graphs benefited the students, e.g., instead of ""sparked curiosity"", say ""enabled a clearer understanding of how phase angles influence current leading or lagging EMF, thus deepening their comprehension of circuit behavior."" This clarifies the value added by the lecture's focus on Phasers & Graphs.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found the lecture on Phasers & Graphs enlightening, with graphical representations of phasors and sine wave visualizations being pivotal in enhancing their understanding and problem-solving skills. Notably, these visual aids facilitated key 'aha' moments, such as realizing how phasor graphs simplify complex questions and illustrate the direct relationship between impedance (Z) and resistance (R) at resonance (where Z=R and X_L=X_C). This visual-centric approach enabled a clearer understanding of how phase angles influence current leading or lagging EMF, thus deepening their comprehension of circuit behavior at resonance."
