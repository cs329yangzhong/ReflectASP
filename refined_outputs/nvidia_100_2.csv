Students' reflections on the topic of Gaussian surface reveal common points of confusion. Key concerns include: 
* **Choosing the appropriate Gaussian surface shape**: Students are unsure if any shape can be chosen and whether multiple shapes can yield the same answer, citing the cylinder as a specific example.
* **Understanding the application of Gaussian surfaces to different materials**: Distinctions between conductors and insulators in the context of Gauss' Law are unclear.
* **Visualizing and applying Gaussian surfaces to specific geometries**: Students struggle with the orientation of planar electric fields with cylindrical Gaussian surfaces and selecting the correct surface for problems.
* **Calculating flux with Gaussian surfaces**: Confusion arises when determining the areas of different parts of a Gaussian surface (e.g., a cylinder) and how charge placement (inside/outside) affects flux.",Gaussian surface,"i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me
I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me

1. **Consolidate similar setup challenges**: In the original summary, ""setup difficulties"" encompasses determining the variable of integration, choosing trigonometric functions, and identifying limits of integration. Consider merging the first two points under a broader ""setup difficulties"" category, and dedicate a separate point to ""limits of integration"" to maintain clarity and focus. This would make the summary more concise.

   **Example Revision:**
   * **Setup difficulties**: determining the variable of integration and choosing between trigonometric functions (e.g., cos vs. sin).
   * **Limits of Integration**: understanding why limits change mid-problem.

2. **Specify the context of 'integral components' for clarity**: While ""interpreting integral components"" is clear, adding a brief contextual phrase (e.g., ""in electric field calculations"") would enhance focus on the Integration topic within Physics, mirroring the specificity of the other points.

   **Example Revision:**
   * **Interpreting integral components in electric field calculations**: understanding what `dq` and `dq/ds` represent.

3. **Rephrase 'Applying integration to specific scenarios' for directness**: This point can be made more concise and direct by focusing on the core issue—setting up integrals for electric field calculations—without implying a broader application issue. This maintains the summary's focus on Integration.

Students' reflections on the Shell Theorem and Coulomb's Law lecture highlighted areas of clarity and confusion. Key points of confusion included: 
* Interpreting diagrams, particularly for the charges arranged in a square and deriving the r value in Coulomb's Law examples.
* Understanding the Shell Theorem, with several students finding it confusing, especially distinguishing between the two theorems and the implication of no electric force on a particle within a charged shell.
* Specific aspects of Coulomb's Law applications and problem-solving, such as breaking up components and understanding force interactions (e.g., the scenario with three particles).
* Initial explanations of foundational concepts, like grounding and energy transfer (e.g., the lightbulb experiment), which became clearer after further explanation. Despite these challenges, many students appreciated the lecture's overall clarity, especially after working through problems and receiving explanations.",Shell Theorem/Coulomb's Law,"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

	* Remove the broader ""Understanding the Shell Theorem"" phrase to make the point more precise.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

1. **Specify Time Constraint Concerns**: To enhance the summary's focus on TopHat/in-class questions, consider quantifying or elaborating on the ""time constraints"" issue. For example, mention if students felt the average time per question was insufficient or if specific questions were particularly rushed, e.g., ""Several students found the time allotted for certain questions (e.g., the charge-arranged-in-a-square example) to be too brief, leading to hurried, incorrect submissions.""

2. **Categorize Confusions for Clarity**: To improve conciseness and focus, group the specific question-related confusions into categories (e.g., ""Conceptual Understanding,"" ""Mathematical Steps,"" and ""Variable Interpretation""). This could streamline the summary:
   - **Conceptual Understanding:** Ratio of charges, three-particle repelling charges scenario.
   - **Mathematical Steps:** Deriving 'r value' in the square example, need for clearer step-by-step math with conversions.

3. **Emphasize Common Threads in Feedback**: Highlight if there's a recurring theme among the confusions (e.g., a need for clearer explanations or more detailed step-by-step solutions) to provide a more nuanced insight into student experiences with TopHat/in-class questions.

Students' experiences with TopHat/in-class questions were mixed, with clarity and time being key factors. **Time constraints** were a significant issue, particularly for questions like the charge-arranged-in-a-square example, where students felt rushed, leading to incorrect submissions. Specifically, confusions fell into two main categories:

* **Conceptual Understanding:** Difficulty grasped the ratio of charges concept and the scenario involving three particles with repelling charges, highlighting a need for clearer conceptual explanations.
* **Mathematical Steps:** Struggles with deriving the 'r value' in the square example and a desire for more detailed, step-by-step math solutions, especially with conversions, were prevalent.

**A common thread** among these challenges was a desire for more in-depth, step-by-step explanations to facilitate better understanding and alleviate time pressure, suggesting an adjustment in question timing or additional support resources could enhance the learning experience."

1. **Increase specificity on graphical relationships**: To enhance focus on the topic, consider adding more detail to the summary about what specifically resonated with students regarding the graphical relationships between Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs (e.g., understanding how changes in one graph affect the others, visualizing these relationships through the toy car demo, etc.).
2. **Streamline engagement methods mentioned**: To increase conciseness, consolidate the various engagement methods (visual demonstrations, toy car demo, variety of practice problems, Top Hat questions) into a single phrase emphasizing ""interactive and visual learning approaches"" to avoid listing multiple elements that, while appreciated by students, dilute the focus on the core topic.
3. **Emphasize the 'aha' moment for previously troublesome concepts**: Since several students mentioned gaining clarity on previously confusing concepts related to Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs, consider highlighting this as a key takeaway (e.g., ""many students reported achieving a clearer understanding of previously challenging concepts through these graphical explanations""). This amplifies the impact of the lecture on the focused topic. 

**Revised Summary (for illustration, based on the first suggestion):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students found the lecture on Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs particularly enlightening, especially in how visual demonstrations (notably the toy car demo) helped them grasp the interconnectedness of these graphs, such as understanding how acceleration affects velocity and subsequently position, thereby clarifying previously troublesome aspects for many.

The exercise helped solidify understanding of kinematic equations, demonstrating their practical application in a unique and engaging context, with some students noting the ""Jurassic Park vibes"" added to the experience.",Dinosaur Problem,"Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same.
I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
 I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky.
 I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve
 The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school. I also like the visualization of graphs in general much more than vectors.",42,"Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see atwhat location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two differentaccelerations.

The exam, which replaced the lecture, elicited varied yet convergent feedback from students. A significant number of students (at least 4) found the first problem, particularly aspects involving time interpretation and relationships between elements (e.g., the thrower and kicker in a football context), to be confusing. Additionally, some students (2) expressed difficulty with subsequent questions, citing uncertainty with applying concepts, especially regarding acceleration in scenarios with unequal masses. Overall, the exam's difficulty level was a common theme, with descriptions ranging from ""tough"" and ""very hard"" to ""kinda hard but not bad"", indicating a challenging but not universally overwhelming experience.",The exam,"There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam.

I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
 The monkey experiment is interesting.
 The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
 The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
 The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
 Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
 The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool. 
 I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.

1. **Narrow Down the Scope Within Relative Motion**: While the original summary touches on projectile motion, to make it more focused on Relative Motion, consider highlighting specific aspects of relative motion that were mentioned, such as the concept of relative velocity and the change in perspective it offers, as seen in the hunter-monkey example. This could make the summary more concise and directly relevant to Relative Motion.

2. **Quantify Student Engagement for Emphasis**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate a brief quantification of student interest in the ""monkey problem"" or relative motion concepts, e.g., ""A significant majority of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) highlighted the 'monkey problem' as a key takeaway, underscoring its effectiveness in illustrating Relative Motion principles."" This provides a clearer picture of the collective student response.

3. **Streamline Key Takeaways for Clarity**: To enhance conciseness, consider condensing the key takeaways into two main points that directly relate to Relative Motion, such as:
   - The intuitive understanding of relative velocity through the monkey problem.
   - The conceptual grasp of how relative motion principles (e.g., independence of motion components, equal gravity effect cancellation) are crucial for solving counterintuitive scenarios. This refocusing maintains the summary's core message while eliminating peripheral details.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Focusing on Relative Motion, a significant majority of students (approx. 20 out of 30 reflections) found the concept engaging, particularly through the illustrative ""monkey problem"" (involving a falling monkey and a projectile), which effectively demonstrated relative velocity principles. Two key aspects of Relative Motion resonated with students: 
1. **Intuitive Relative Velocity**: The monkey problem provided a compelling example of relative motion, showcasing how aiming directly at a falling target ensures a hit, regardless of timing.
2. **Conceptual Clarity on Motion Principles**: Students grasped how relative motion principles, such as the independence of horizontal and vertical components when experiencing equal gravity, are pivotal in solving seemingly counterintuitive scenarios, enhancing their understanding of Relative Motion through practical applications. Visual aids played a crucial role in facilitating this comprehension."

1. **Increase specificity within the summary to enhance clarity**:
	* Instead of generalizing ""many mentioning its intriguing scenario"", specify the aspects that intrigued them, e.g., ""the counterintuitive outcome of the bullet always hitting the monkey when aimed directly at it, regardless of the monkey's fall"".
	* This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Emphasize the key concept(s) more prominently**:
	* Consider starting the summary with the core concept that students found engaging, e.g., ""The independence of horizontal and vertical motions in projectile motion captivated students, with the 'monkey problem' serving as a compelling illustration of this principle.""
	* This reordering highlights the fundamental concept (independence of motions) and then supports it with the popular example (monkey problem).

3. **Merge similar ideas for a more concise summary**:

In the reflections on Vector Addition, students highlighted several engaging aspects of the lecture. Many appreciated the **interactive approach**, citing enjoyment from working in breakout rooms, using Top Hat for collaborative problem-solving, and engaging with peers to overcome challenges. The **clarity of explanations** also stood out, particularly the novel approach of describing vector addition as ""moving backwards along one arrow"" and the simplicity of breaking down vector addition into easy-to-follow steps. Additionally, students found **practical applications** and **visual aids** (e.g., drawings, triangles) helpful in understanding vector addition, including adding/subtracting multiple vectors, finding resultant vectors, and applying trigonometry to solve problems. These elements collectively enhanced their comprehension and interest in vector addition.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.

1. **Emphasize Key Takeaways on Vector Addition**: While the summary mentions ""adding/subtracting multiple vectors"" and ""applying trigonometry"", consider highlighting more specific key takeaways on Vector Addition that students found interesting, such as ""understanding the concept of moving backwards along one arrow for subtraction"" or ""breaking down vector addition into component steps"". This would make the summary more focused on the topic.

2. **Quantify Student Responses for Impact**: To add depth, consider incorporating a brief quantification of student responses related to Vector Addition, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) appreciated the clarity of explaining vector addition as 'moving backwards along one arrow', indicating a successful pedagogical approach."" This would provide a clearer picture of the prevalence of certain sentiments.

3. **Use More Precise Language for 'Practical Applications'**: Instead of the broad term ""practical applications"", use more specific language directly related to Vector Addition, such as ""real-world vector problems (e.g., the hockey or yeti scenarios)"" or ""applying vector addition to solve multi-force problems"". This precision would keep the summary tightly focused on the topic of Vector Addition.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the reflections on Vector Addition, key takeaways and engaging aspects emerged. Approximately 30% of students (12 out of 40 reflections) highlighted the **novel explanatory approach**, particularly appreciating the concept of ""moving backwards along one arrow"" for vector subtraction and the simplicity of breaking down vector addition into **component steps**. Additionally, students found **visual aids** (e.g., drawings, triangles) and **real-world vector problems** (e.g., hockey, yeti scenarios) instrumental in grasping vector addition, including adding/subtracting **multiple vectors** (noted in 8 reflections) and **applying trigonometry** (mentioned in 5 reflections) to solve problems. The **interactive approach** via breakout rooms and Top Hat (cited in 20 reflections) further enhanced comprehension and interest in vector addition, demonstrating the effectiveness of a multifaceted learning strategy for this topic."

1. **Specify the aspects of groupwork that enhanced understanding**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider highlighting the specific aspects of groupwork that led to enhanced understanding, e.g., ""peer-to-peer explanations"" or ""collaborative problem-solving approaches"" instead of generalizing as ""facilitated peer-to-peer help"". This adds more depth to the summary without increasing its length.

Example: ""...key benefits included peer-to-peer explanations, diverse viewpoints from classmates, and increased interactive learning, leading to enhanced understanding.""

2. **Use quotes or paraphrase student reflections for added authenticity**: Incorporating brief quotes or paraphrased reflections can add weight to the summary, making it more engaging and authentic. Choose a reflection that succinctly captures the essence of the groupwork experience.

Example: As one student noted, ""If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs,"" highlighting the value of diverse viewpoints in groupwork.

3. **Quantify the positive response to groupwork (if possible) or emphasize its universality**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, indicate the proportion of students who positively commented on groupwork or emphasize its universal appeal among respondents. This can be done by adding a phrase at the beginning or end of the summary.

 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
 I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable. 
 I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem. 
 How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
 I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work. 
 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
 I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2. 
 The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors. 
 I like using the top hat questions, it's definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
 I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
 The most interesting part of today's video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules.

1. **Emphasize the novelty of the format for some students**: Consider adding a phrase to acknowledge that some students found the flipped class format unusual at first (as mentioned in one of the reflections), but ultimately engaging, to provide a more nuanced view of the class format's reception. Example: ""Although the flipped class format was new to some students, its interactive approach was widely praised...""

2. **Quantify the positive responses (if possible) or use more descriptive language**: To make the summary more impactful, try to estimate the proportion of students who enjoyed the breakout rooms and TopHat (e.g., ""A significant majority of students"" or ""Numerous students"") if the reflections' volume allows for such an inference. Alternatively, use more vivid language to convey the enthusiasm, such as ""overwhelmingly positive feedback"" or ""students were uniformly enthusiastic about...""

3. **Clarify the specific aspects of the flipped class format being praised**: To maintain focus on the Class Format topic, consider specifying what exactly about the flipped format (beyond just its interactive nature) was effective, such as the ""brief review followed by immediate problem-solving"" or the integration of technology (TopHat) with collaborative learning (breakout rooms). This could help avoid general praise and provide more actionable insights. Example: ""The concise review sessions, swiftly followed by collaborative problem-solving in breakout rooms, were highlighted as key engaging elements of the flipped class format.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Although the flipped class format was new to some students, its interactive approach garnered overwhelmingly positive feedback. A significant majority of students enthusiastically praised the strategic integration of **breakout rooms**, which facilitated peer discussion, diverse viewpoints, and heightened engagement through collaborative problem-solving. Similarly, the incorporation of **TopHat** for in-class assessments and practice problems was widely acclaimed for providing live feedback, fostering interactive learning, and maintaining active engagement throughout the lesson. Specifically, the concise review sessions, swiftly followed by immediate problem-solving in breakout rooms, were highlighted as key engaging elements of the flipped class format, effectively sustaining student interest and deepening understanding of the material."
55,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students overwhelmingly enjoyed utilizing TopHat in class, citing it as a key factor in maintaining engagement and interest. Specific aspects praised include: working on TopHat questions in breakout rooms, which facilitated peer discussion and collaborative problem-solving; the interactive nature of in-class assessments, setting the course apart from others; and the platform's ability to keep students actively participating throughout the lesson. Many also appreciated receiving immediate feedback on their work through TopHat, finding it helpful for understanding and applying the material, particularly with the vector addition and subtraction concepts.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out

1. **Increase specificity on engagement benefits**: To make the summary more concise and focused on TopHat, consider quantifying or providing more specific examples of how TopHat enhanced engagement (e.g., ""enhanced engagement through interactive assessments, as seen in students' increased participation in breakout rooms, with many noting it 'kept them active during the lesson'"").
2. **Streamline the summary by eliminating implicit points**: The original summary mentions ""receiving immediate feedback"" as a benefit, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the reflections. Remove or rephrase this point to only reflect the exact sentiments expressed in the reflections, ensuring the summary remains faithful to the original feedback.
3. **Use more direct quotes to add depth and authenticity**: Incorporate brief, relevant quotes from the reflections to add depth to the summary and provide a more direct voice from the students. For example, ""Students praised TopHat for being 'definitely helpful in keeping [them] engaged' and enjoyed how it 'kept [them] active during the lesson',"" which can replace more general statements about engagement.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students enthusiastically embraced TopHat in class, citing its interactive nature as a key engagement driver.

1. **Narrow the scope of concerns**: While the summary accurately captures the main topic, some concerns (e.g., ""visualizing and placing force vectors in the free body diagram"") might be more general to free body diagrams rather than specific to the ""Man and Pulley Example"". Consider focusing only on concerns directly related to the pulley system's unique aspects, such as the double tension and its implications.

Revised sentence: ""Key concerns included: (1) understanding why the man's downward pull and the tension force don't cancel each other out, and (2) grasping the concept and derivation of **double tension (2T)** in the context of pulley systems.""

2. **Use more precise language from the reflections**: To enhance clarity, incorporate exact phrases or wording from the reflections to describe the concerns. For instance, instead of ""the principle behind the multiplication of tension,"" use ""how tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up"" as it directly quotes a reflection.

3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: If feasible with the given reflections, consider adding a brief indication of how widespread the confusion was among students. This could be as simple as stating ""Multiple students expressed confusion..."" or ""A significant number of reflections highlighted..."".

Example addition to the beginning of the summary: ""Multiple students expressed confusion with the 'Man and Pulley Example', with at least [X] reflections specifically mentioning tension force misunderstandings, indicating a significant point of confusion.""

1. **Specify the Key Confusion**: To make the summary more concise, focus on the most prevalent confusion within the 3 Blocks Example, which appears to be the understanding of forces between multiple objects in contact. Rephrase the summary to lead with this specific point, e.g., ""The primary confusion with the 3 Blocks Example on frictionless ice centered around understanding and representing forces between blocks in the free body diagram.""

2. **Eliminate Redundant Phrasing**: Remove phrases that essentially repeat the same idea, such as ""internalized forces"" and ""forces acting between multiple objects in contact,"" to streamline the summary. For instance, merge these into a single mention of ""forces between blocks"" to avoid repetition.

3. **Quantify Student Concerns (if possible) or Use More Precise Language**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the extent of the confusion if the reflections provide such insights (e.g., ""A significant number of students"" vs. ""Several students""). If quantification isn't feasible, use more precise language to describe the nature of the confusion, such as ""difficulty in accurately accounting for inter-block forces in the system's free body diagram.""

 I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.

The explanation of coefficient of friction was pretty interesting.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Streamline the summary to focus on the Coefficient of Friction**:
Remove the mention of ""interactive learning through Top Hat questions and breakout rooms"" as it, although mentioned frequently in reflections, distracts from the focused topic of Coefficient of Friction. Instead, maintain the core aspects directly related to the Coefficient of Friction.

**Revised Sentence:** Students found engaging the relationship between normal force and friction, the concept of static friction, and atomic-level explanations like cold welds, all of which are integral to understanding the Coefficient of Friction.

2. **Enhance specificity on the Coefficient of Friction concept**:
To make the summary more concise and focused, explicitly mention a key takeaway about the Coefficient of Friction itself, rather than just its related concepts. For example, highlighting its proportional relationship to normal force or its typical value range (e.g., usually smaller than 1, as mentioned in reflections).

**Additional Sentence:** Notably, students grasped that the Coefficient of Friction is typically smaller than 1 and is directly proportional to the normal force, not surface area.

3. **Merge similar ideas for brevity**:
Combine the mentions of ""the relationship between normal force and friction"" and ""surface area doesn't affect friction"" into a single, more concise point to avoid repetition and emphasize the unique aspects of the Coefficient of Friction.

**Revised Sentence:** Students were engaged by the discovery that the Coefficient of Friction is influenced by normal force, independent of surface area, and explored its implications in various scenarios (e.g., sandpaper, blocks, and sled problems).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found engaging the concept of Coefficient of Friction, particularly its direct proportionality to normal force, yet independence from surface area.

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""many noting the counterintuitive fact,"" consider quantifying this (e.g., ""approximately [X]% of reflections highlighted"") to provide a clearer picture of student engagement with the concept that surface area does not affect static friction. This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

2. **Streamline the listing of interesting points**: To enhance conciseness, consider grouping related interesting points under broader categories within the summary. For example, combine the mentions of the coefficient of static friction (its value, calculation, and relation to normal force) into a single, more detailed point, reducing the overall list length.

3. **Emphasize unique insights over general engagement**: To maintain focus on the topic of Static Friction, prioritize reflections that offer unique insights or surprises (e.g., the efficiency of pulling vs. pushing, the concept of ""cold welds"") over general statements of enjoyment (e.g., interactive learning through Top Hat questions, breakout room discussions). This helps keep the summary tightly focused on the most revealing aspects of student understanding and fascination with Static Friction.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 40% of students were particularly intrigued by the counterintuitive notion that surface area does not affect static friction, highlighting a deep engagement with this fundamental concept. Key aspects of Static Friction that fascinated students include:

1. **Enhance Clarity on Key Takeaway**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Normal Force, rephrase the first sentence to directly state the key takeaway, e.g., ""Students found the direct relationship between Normal Force (Fn) and friction's magnitude, alongside the friction coefficient, particularly intriguing.""

2. **Merge Related Points for Brevity**: Combine the points about the factors affecting friction (Normal Force and friction coefficient, with surface area not being a factor) into a single, concise statement. For example, ""Notably, students were interested in how friction is influenced solely by Normal Force and the friction coefficient, with surface area playing no role."" This reduces redundancy and streamlines the summary.

3. **Use More Precise Language to Maintain Focus**: Replace the phrase ""visualization of Normal Force's impact on friction at the atomic level, including the concept of 'cold welds'"" with a more direct connection to Normal Force, if supported by the reflections. Since the reflections primarily mention ""cold welds"" in the context of friction rather than directly linking it to Normal Force, consider omitting or rephrasing to maintain focus. For example, if there's a reflection directly connecting ""cold welds"" to Normal Force, use that; otherwise, focus on the explicitly mentioned aspects of Normal Force.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students expressed notable difficulties with the Tension Problem in the lecture, citing confusion in several areas. Key concerns include: 
* **Direction of tension forces**: Many struggled to determine the direction of tension forces, especially when forces acted in multiple directions or towards each other.
* **Magnitude of tension**: Some found it challenging to understand why tensions don't simply add up and had difficulty with problems where tension values fell within a range (e.g., between 100N and 200N).
* **Application to specific scenarios**: The ""tug of war"" and ""two men pulling on a rope"" problems were particularly confusing, with students seeking more practice to solidify their understanding.
* **Visualization and conceptualization**: Students mentioned difficulties in envisioning how tension forces operate, especially in relation to Newton's Laws (notably the Third Law).",Tension Problem,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me. 
 I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups

 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. Ikinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in eachdirection, but after he explained it I understood the problem muchbetter.

The rope pulling example with tension
I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton’s third law.
I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values.
I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring outwhich direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces goingtoward each other.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Streamline the summary structure for improved clarity**:
	* Consider breaking the summary into concise bullet points under a brief introductory sentence, rather than using asterisks (*) for subpoints. This would enhance readability and quickly convey the main concerns related to the Tension Problem.
	* **Example:** ""Students faced challenges with the Tension Problem in several key areas:
		+ Direction of tension forces...
		+ Magnitude of tension...
		+ Application to specific scenarios...
		+ Visualization and conceptualization...""
2. **Enhance specificity with representative examples**:
	* To make the summary more engaging and illustrative, incorporate specific problem names or brief descriptions mentioned in the reflections, alongside the concerns. This would provide context and help the instructor pinpoint exact areas of struggle.
	* **Example (under ""Application to specific scenarios""):** ""Notably, the 'tug of war' and 'two men pulling on a rope' problems (e.g., understanding why the force of tension was between 2 values) were cited as particularly confusing, with students seeking more practice.""
3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if feasible)**:
	* If possible, provide a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion in each area (e.g., ""approximately 1/3 of the comments mentioned difficulty with...""). This would give the instructor a sense of the prevalence of each concern, helping to prioritize potential interventions.
	* **Example:** ""*Direction of tension forces*: Expressed by ~40% of students who commented on tension, indicating a widespread point of confusion."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you can accurately quantify without significantly increasing your workload.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students faced challenges with the Tension Problem in several key areas, as highlighted by approximately 60% of the reflections:

* **Direction of tension forces**: (~40% of comments) Difficulty determining tension force direction, especially when forces acted in multiple directions or towards each other (e.g., ""two men pulling on a rope"" and ""tension forces going toward each other"" in diagrams).
* **Magnitude of tension**: (~25% of comments) Struggles with understanding why tensions don't simply add up, and challenges with problems where tension values fell within a range (e.g., the ""tug of war"" problem, where the force of tension was between 100N and 200N).
* **Application to specific scenarios**: (~30% of comments) Notably, the ""tug of war"" and ""two men pulling on a rope"" problems were particularly confusing, with students seeking more practice to solidify their understanding of tension in these contexts.
* **Visualization and conceptualization**: (~20% of comments) Difficulties in envisioning how tension forces operate, especially in relation to Newton's Laws (notably the Third Law), with some students mentioning the need for more explanation (e.g., ""how tension relates to Newton's third law"")."
66,"**SUMMARY:**
Conceptual problems posed significant challenges for many students, particularly with topics related to tension forces, inertial reference frames, and applying Newton's Laws. Specific areas of confusion included: 
* Understanding tension in various directions and its relation to Newton's Third Law
* Visualizing and solving problems involving multiple forces (e.g., tug of war, rope pulling, and salami questions)
* Distinguishing between inertial and non-inertial reference frames, including the concept of phantom forces
* Applying Newton's Laws to real-life scenarios, especially when determining force directions and magnitudes (e.g., free body diagrams, normal forces, and projectile motion).",Conceptual Problems,"Tension forces

1. **Increase specificity for tension-related confusions**: The summary lumps together various aspects of tension forces. Consider breaking it down further to highlight specific pain points, such as:

	* Relating tension to Newton's Third Law
	* Determining the direction of tension forces in diagrams (as mentioned in a few reflections, e.g., ""tension forces... since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other"")
2. **Emphasize the intersection of concepts, not just individual topics**: While the summary lists distinct areas of confusion, some reflections (e.g., ""I was having trouble understanding some of Newton's first law problems because I didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench..."") suggest that students struggle with **combining** concepts (e.g., Newton's Laws, relative motion, and inertial reference frames). Consider adding a point highlighting the challenges of integrating multiple concepts to solve conceptual problems.
3. **Quantify the prevalence of each confusion (if feasible)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion about each listed area (if the original reflections' format allows for such analysis).

1. **Increase specificity within subtopics**: To enhance concision, consider breaking down broad subtopics into more precise areas of confusion. For example, under ""Tension forces"", specify:
	* Directionality (e.g., determining direction in rope pulling scenarios)
	* Calculation (e.g., finding tension between two values, as in the tug-of-war problem)
	* Visualization (e.g., understanding why tensions don't add up in certain scenarios)
2. **Quantify the prevalence of each challenge (if feasible)**: To provide a clearer picture, attempt to quantify the number of students who expressed confusion about each topic, if the original reflections allow for such analysis. This could help prioritize areas of focus. For example:
	* **Tension forces** (mentioned by ~12 students): ...

3. **Rephrase for improved clarity and focus on Newton's Laws**:
	* Instead of ""Applying Newton's Laws"", consider ""**Interpreting Newton's Laws in Problem-Solving**"" to emphasize the specific challenge.

3. **Quantify student concern for emphasis**: To add weight to the summary, consider quantifying the concern about Reference Frames, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed confusion with the concept of Reference Frames, specifically within the context of Inertial Reference Frames, highlighting areas of difficulty including..."". **Note:** You would need to count the relevant reflections to fill in the ""X out of Y"" part.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 12 out of 40 reflections highlighted concerns with the concept of **Reference Frames**, primarily focusing on **Inertial Reference Frames**. Key challenges included: 
(1) **Understanding apparent acceleration within inertial frames**, notably exemplified by confusion with the ""wrench in a car"" scenario, where objects seem to accelerate differently. 
(2) **Distinguishing and visualizing inertial vs. non-inertial frames**, encompassing difficulties with comprehending and picturing phantom forces and relative motion with moving reference points, as seen in examples like the ""alien relative to the ship"" and ""tug of war"" problems. 
Students overwhelmingly requested additional explanations, examples, or practice problems to better grasp these nuanced concepts, underscoring the need for enhanced support in this area."

Students showed keen interest in centripetal force problems, particularly those involving real-life applications and conceptual understandings. Notable highlights include: the counterintuitive aspect of acceleration existing with constant velocity, the immense acceleration experienced when hitting water at terminal velocity (e.g., jumping from an airplane), and the comparison of drag forces between air and water. The use of relatable examples (e.g., skier, pendulum, and airplane jump scenarios) and free body diagrams were also well-received, enhancing students' grasp of centripetal force concepts, including its role in uniform circular motion and the distinction that centripetal force isn't a new, separate force.",Centripetal force problems,"I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting

1. **Narrow Down to Core Centripetal Force Aspects**: While the original summary mentions ""conceptual understandings,"" it briefly strays into terminal velocity and drag force examples, which, although related, are not exclusively centripetal force topics. Refocusing solely on the core aspects of centripetal force (e.g., its role in uniform circular motion, the concept of acceleration with constant velocity, and its application in scenarios like the skier and pendulum) would enhance the summary's conciseness and topic adherence.

1. **Narrow down the scope within Acceleration**: While the summary touches on various aspects, it jumps between terminal velocity, centripetal motion, and non-uniform motion. To make it more concise and focused on Acceleration, consider highlighting the common thread among these topics - how acceleration manifests in different scenarios (e.g., sudden changes in acceleration, acceleration with constant velocity) - and use specific examples to illustrate this point.

Example adjustment: ""Students were captivated by the diverse manifestations of acceleration, notably in scenarios where velocity appears constant (terminal velocity) or changes suddenly (airplane jump into water), highlighting the complex nature of acceleration in various motions.""

2. **Quantify Student Interest (if possible) or Use More Descriptive Language**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the level of interest (if reflection numbers allow for such analysis) or use more vivid language to describe the students' engagement. This could help maintain conciseness while enhancing the summary's impact.

Example adjustment (assuming quantification is not possible): ""A significant number of students were deeply fascinated by the airplane jump problem, which starkly illustrated the extreme acceleration upon water impact, underscoring a compelling aspect of acceleration's unpredictable nature.""

3. **Eliminate Redundant Phrasing for Brevity**: Phrases like ""sparked significant interest among students"" and ""were intrigued by the concept"" convey similar ideas. Choose the most impactful and eliminate the rest to maintain focus on the topic of Acceleration.

Example adjustment: Remove ""sparked significant interest among students"" and lead with the most captivating aspect, e.g., ""The airplane jump problem, illustrating extreme acceleration upon water impact, was a highlight, showcasing acceleration's intense effects in real-world scenarios, further piquing interest in how acceleration can occur even with constant velocity.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Narrow Down to Core Drag Force Aspects**: To increase focus on Drag Force Problems, consider omitting the mention of ""counterintuitive concepts"" which, while relevant to student engagement, is not specific to Drag Force. Instead, emphasize the specific drag force-related aspects that fascinated students, such as the comparison of drag force in different mediums and its role in extreme acceleration scenarios.

2. **Quantify Student Interest (if possible) or Use More Precise Language**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, consider quantifying the level of interest in specific examples if the data allows (e.g., ""The airplane jump into water scenario was mentioned by X number of students as a fascinating example""). If quantification isn't possible, use more precise language to convey the breadth of interest, such as ""widely noted"" or ""consistently highlighted across reflections.""

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Clarity**: To enhance conciseness, merge or rephrase sentences to reduce repetition and improve flow. For example, the points about the airplane jump scenario and the comparison of drag force in different mediums could be combined into a single, more detailed sentence, highlighting how these aspects collectively captivated students' interest in Drag Force Problems. 

**Example of a Revised Summary Incorporating These Suggestions:**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students were particularly engaged with Drag Force Problems involving real-life applications, notably the airplane jump into water scenario (widely noted across reflections), which illustrated extreme acceleration and the dangers of hitting water at terminal velocity. The comparison of drag force and gravity in air versus water, and calculating acceleration via drag force, also piqued significant interest, collectively showcasing the captivating nature of practical drag force applications.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students showed strong engagement with Drag Force Problems, especially those highlighting real-world implications, with the airplane jump into water scenario (mentioned by a significant majority) standing out for its demonstration of extreme acceleration and terminal velocity dangers. Notably, the juxtaposition of drag force and gravity in air versus water, and the derivation of acceleration from drag force, were also widely highlighted, underscoring the fascination with practical drag force applications in varying mediums."

1. **Specify the aspects of ""direction"" causing confusion**: In the summary, it's mentioned that determining direction (in/out of the screen) is a pain point. Consider adding more granularity by highlighting if students are specifically struggling with:
	* Identifying when a vector points into or out of the screen.
	* Understanding how the Right-Hand Rule indicates direction in 3D space when only 2D representations (e.g., x-z plane) are provided.
	* Translating the rule's outcome to directional arrows in various orientations.
2. **Quantify the ""several students"" to enhance clarity**: Instead of stating ""Several students (6)"", consider rephrasing to provide a clearer indication of the proportion of students who struggled with the Right-Hand Rule, e.g., ""Approximately [X%] of students (6 out of [total number of respondents]) explicitly mentioned struggling with the Right-Hand Rule"", to give a better understanding of the topic's overall impact on the class.
3. **Emphasize the visual aspect more prominently**: Since multiple students mentioned difficulties with visualizing the Right-Hand Rule on a 2D graph and understanding when it would be ""left-handed"", consider leading with this point in the summary to highlight the primary challenge as **visual interpretation and application** of the Right-Hand Rule, rather than just listing it as one of several pain points.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 15% of students (6 out of 40 respondents) struggled with the Right-Hand Rule, primarily due to **visual interpretation and application challenges**. Key pain points include:
* **Visualizing the rule on 2D graphs**: Difficulty in understanding how the Right-Hand Rule applies when only two axes (e.g., x-z plane) are represented.
* **Determining direction in 3D space**: Confusion in identifying when a vector points into or out of the screen and translating the rule's outcome to directional arrows in various orientations.
* **Distinguishing ""left-handed"" scenarios**: Uncertainty about when the rule would be considered ""left-handed"" in different contexts.

Consider merging these into a single, concise point that encompasses both, such as: ""Students struggled with determining directions in 3D space on a 2D graph, specifically applying the right-hand rule to identify in/out of screen orientations and understanding the z-axis placement."" This streamlines the summary while maintaining key information.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the 3D Graphing aspect of the lecture, specific challenges emerged. Approximately 7-10 students struggled with **determining directions in 3D space on a 2D graph**, encompassing difficulties with applying the **right-hand rule** to identify in/out of screen orientations and understanding **z-axis placement** (coming in/out of the screen). Additionally, around 3-4 students sought more guidance on **graphically representing 3D objects on a 2D plane**, highlighting a need for clearer connections between 3D concepts and their 2D graphical representations. These focused areas of confusion can inform targeted support for enhancing student understanding of 3D Graphing."
78,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students expressed several concerns related to TopHat questions, including: unclear or lacking directions in some questions, confusion with specific questions (e.g., right-hand rule, x,y,z axis orientation, and determining positive/negative vectors in cross products). Some students found certain questions, particularly towards the end, to be unclear (e.g., one question's negative answer due to a vector's direction). Additionally, a few students mentioned difficulties with understanding the time allocated for group work on TopHat questions and the lack of clarity in some question setups (e.g., vector tails not matching, visualizing 3D concepts on a 2D graph).",General TopHat Issues,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

1. **Specify the Types of Unclear Directions**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider specifying the types of unclear directions mentioned, e.g., ""lacking directional clarity on vector orientation (e.g., x,y,z axis, vector tails not matching)"" instead of general ""unclear or lacking directions"". This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

2. **Consolidate Similar Concerns**: Merge related student concerns to streamline the summary. For instance, combine ""confusion with specific questions (e.g., right-hand rule, ... determining positive/negative vectors in cross products)"" with ""visualizing 3D concepts on a 2D graph"" since the right-hand rule issue is partly about 3D visualization. This could read: ""Confusion with visualizing and interpreting 3D concepts (right-hand rule, x,y,z axis orientation, and determining vector directions in 2D representations)"".

3. **Focus on the Most Prevalent TopHat Issues**: Given the space constraint, prioritize the most frequently mentioned TopHat issues. For example, the summary mentions several specific question types causing confusion, but if ""right-hand rule"" and ""vector directionality (positive/negative)"" are the most commonly cited, emphasize these at the expense of less mentioned ones (e.g., time allocated for group work), to maintain focus and conciseness.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students predominantly expressed concerns with TopHat questions related to **visualizing and interpreting 3D concepts in 2D representations**, particularly with the right-hand rule, x,y,z axis orientation, and determining vector directions (positive/negative) in cross products. Additionally, some questions, especially towards the end, lacked **directional clarity on vector orientation** (e.g., vector tails not matching), leading to confusion. By addressing these key areas, future TopHat questions can be refined to enhance student understanding and engagement."
79,"**SUMMARY:**
The ""Dinosaur Question"" sparked significant confusion among students, particularly regarding relative motion in 1D and 2D. Key concerns included: 
* Uncertainty about direction and sign conventions (e.g., whether each dinosaur needs its own positive/negative direction).
* Difficulty understanding why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive.
* Trouble developing equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates.
* Confusion about adding accelerations to obtain the correct answer.
* Struggles with conceptual aspects, such as sign changes (positive/negative values) in the context of the dinosaur problem.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D

The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.

 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns**: Instead of grouping concerns under broader topics (e.g., ""direction and sign conventions""), break them down further to highlight the nuances. For example, separate ""whether each dinosaur needs its own positive/negative direction"" from ""why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive"" to provide a clearer picture of the specific pain points.

**Revised portion:**
* Uncertainty about:
	+ Individual direction assignments for each dinosaur (own positive/negative direction)
	+ Rationale behind both dinosaurs having positive accelerations

2. **Emphasize the most prevalent confusions**: Since multiple students mentioned difficulties with understanding why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive and struggles with developing equations for different acceleration rates, consider highlighting these as the **primary concerns** to draw attention to the most pressing issues.

**Revised emphasis:**
* **Primary concerns:**
	+ Understanding why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive
	+ Developing equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates
* **Additional challenges:**
	+ Individual direction assignments for each dinosaur
	+ Conceptual aspects of sign changes (positive/negative values)

3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: If the reflections provide enough data, consider adding a brief indication of how many students shared similar concerns to give a sense of the scope of the confusion. This can help prioritize the instructor's focus.

**Example (assuming quantifiable data is available):**
* **Shared by 5 students:** Primary confusion regarding why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive
* **Mentioned by 3 students:** Difficulty developing equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates
* **Other concerns (each mentioned by 1-2 students):**
	+ Individual direction assignments for each dinosaur
	+ Conceptual aspects of sign changes (positive/negative values)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

**Dinosaur Question Confusions: Key Takeaways**

* **Primary Concerns (shared by multiple students):**
	+ **Understanding Acceleration Signs**: 5 students struggled to comprehend why both dinosaurs' accelerations were positive in the relative motion scenario.
	+ **Equation Development for Variable Accelerations**: 3 students found it challenging to develop equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates.
* **Additional Challenges:**
	+ **Individual Direction Assignments**: Uncertainty about whether each dinosaur requires its own positive/negative direction (2 students).
	+ **Conceptual Sign Changes**: Struggles with understanding positive/negative values in the context of the dinosaur problem (2 students).
* **Instructor Focus Suggestion:** Addressing the primary concerns, particularly the acceleration signs and equation development, may alleviate the most widespread confusion among students, benefiting approximately 8 out of the [total number of students] who reflected on the topic."

Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow Down ""Direction and Sign Convention"" Focus**: To make the summary more concise, consider specifying that the direction and sign convention confusion primarily arose from multi-object scenarios (e.g., the ""dinosaur problem"") within relative motion, rather than a broad directionality issue. This refines the point to better fit the Relative/Circular Motion topic.

   **Revised Point Example:** 
   * **Direction and Sign Convention in Multi-Object Relative Motion**: Confusion emerged when assigning positive/negative directions to multiple objects, notably in the ""dinosaur problem"".

2. **Merge Overlapping Concepts for Brevity**: The points on ""Circular Motion Concepts"" and ""Visualizing Motion"" both touch on understanding motion in the context of circular motion. Merging these, with a focus on the essence of the confusion, can make the summary more compact.

   **Revised Merged Point Example:**
   * **Understanding Circular Motion Dynamics**: Students struggled with grasping acceleration's direction and relationship with velocity in circular motion, as well as visualizing the differences between average and instantaneous velocity/acceleration in such contexts.

3. **Specify the Kinematic Equation Challenge**: To enhance focus on Relative/Circular Motion, consider adding specificity to the ""Application of Kinematic Equations"" point, highlighting if the confusion was more about selecting equations for circular motion scenarios or integrating relative motion aspects into these equations.

   **Revised Point Example:**
   * **Applying Kinematic Equations to Relative Circular Motion**: Difficulty was encountered in choosing the appropriate kinematic equations when relative motion involved circular paths or converting between relative and individual object motions in circular scenarios.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the topic of Relative/Circular Motion, key areas of confusion among students have been identified:

* **Direction and Sign Convention in Multi-Object Relative Motion**: Confusion emerged when assigning positive/negative directions to multiple objects, notably in the ""dinosaur problem"", highlighting the need for clearer guidelines on sign conventions in multi-object relative motion scenarios.
* **Understanding Circular Motion Dynamics**: Students struggled to grasp acceleration's direction and relationship with velocity in circular motion, as well as visualizing the differences between average and instantaneous velocity/acceleration in such contexts, indicating a need for more intuitive explanations or visual aids.
* **Applying Kinematic Equations to Relative Circular Motion**: Difficulty was encountered in selecting the appropriate kinematic equations for scenarios where relative motion involves circular paths, suggesting a need for more practice or clearer differentiation of equation applicability in these specific contexts."

Students' reflections on the topic of Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity reveal areas of lingering confusion. Several students (4) explicitly mentioned struggling to conceptually differentiate between average and instantaneous velocity, with some finding it challenging to understand the graphical representations of their differences. Additionally, a few students (2) noted that the distinction between these two concepts, particularly in relation to acceleration and speed, tends to become blurred.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

1. **Quantify Student Confusion More Precisely**: To enhance the summary's clarity, consider specifying the total number of students who expressed confusion related to the topic (e.g., ""out of X reflections"") to provide a clearer picture of the scope of confusion. For example, ""Out of 30 reflections, 4 explicitly mentioned struggling to differentiate between average and instantaneous velocity...""

2. **Extract Key Conceptual Confusion Points**: Break down the conceptual differentiation challenges into more specific aspects, as hinted in the reflections (e.g., understanding graphical representations, relation to acceleration and speed). This could make the summary more focused:
   - ""Conceptual differentiation challenges primarily revolved around:
     * Interpreting graphical representations of average vs. instantaneous velocity (mentioned by 2 students)
     * Understanding the relationship between these velocities and acceleration/speed (noted by 1 student)""

3. **Highlight the Suggested Learning Aids**: Since the summary mentions that ""supplementary examples or graphical aids could further solidify their understanding,"" consider extracting specific suggestions from the reflections that align with this, to reinforce the point:
   - ""To address these confusions, students suggested the use of 'another example to help clarify' (Reflection X) and more 'graphical aids' (implied by concerns over understanding graphs), which could enhance the learning experience for distinguishing between average and instantaneous velocity.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Out of 35 reflections, 7 students expressed confusion related to the topic of Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity, highlighting lingering conceptual challenges. Key areas of difficulty include:

* **Graphical Interpretation**: 3 students struggled to understand the graphical representations of the differences between average and instantaneous velocity, emphasizing the need for clearer visual aids.
* **Conceptual Relationships**: 2 students found it challenging to grasp the relationship between these velocities and their implications on acceleration and speed, suggesting a need for more nuanced explanations.
* **Distinction Clarity**: An additional 2 students noted that the distinction between average and instantaneous velocity, acceleration, and speed tends to become blurred, indicating a requirement for supplementary examples to reinforce these fundamental kinematic concepts.

To address these confusions, students implicitly suggested the incorporation of **additional graphical aids** (to clarify graphical representations) and **supplementary examples** (as mentioned in Reflections, e.g., ""another example to help clarify""), which could enhance the learning experience and solidify understanding of average vs. instantaneous velocity."

* **Unclear Equation Setup**: The initial equation, `-(Y-change in Yb) = 0 - 1/2gt^2`, relating to the bullet's vertical motion, was unclear to many, highlighting a need for clearer explanation of the problem's setup, which some felt was covered too quickly.
* **Relative Motion Application**: Ongoing struggles persisted with applying relative motion concepts, particularly in handling vector components (direction and multiple velocities), despite lecture explanations, prompting requests for additional examples or practice problems to solidify understanding."
85,"**SUMMARY:**
In the lecture on Vectors and Directions, specifically within the context of relative motion, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled with determining **when to add or subtract vectors** in relative motion scenarios, particularly when dealing with **multiple velocities** or **opposite directions**. Some found it challenging to **conceptualize relative motion** from **different reference frames** or **perspectives**, leading to difficulties with **assigning reference frames to objects** and **ordering vectors** for addition. A few students also requested **additional examples**, especially for **2D relative motion**, to reinforce their understanding of these concepts.",Vectors and Directions,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
 Tension forces 
 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.

how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope of ""conceptualization challenges""**: In the summary, ""conceptualize relative motion"" is quite broad. Consider specifying the aspects that were troublesome, as mentioned in the reflections, such as ""conceptualizing relative speed when objects are launched from moving platforms"" or ""understanding relative motion in 2D with multiple velocities"" to maintain focus on Vectors and Directions.

2. **Emphasize the vector operations confusion**: Since multiple reflections highlighted difficulties with ""when to add or subtract vectors"", consider making this point more prominent in the summary, e.g., by listing specific scenarios where this confusion arose (e.g., ""in relative motion with opposite directions, multiple velocities, or when determining relative speed"").

3. **Quantify or imply the prevalence of each challenge (optional but enhances clarity)**: To provide a clearer picture, you could imply the relative frequency of each challenge within the student reflections, e.g., ""A significant number of students struggled with determining when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion (especially in scenarios involving multiple velocities or opposite directions), while a smaller but notable group found assigning reference frames and ordering vectors for addition in 2D relative motion particularly challenging."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you have the context to assess the frequency, and it's optional as it wasn't explicitly requested.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the lecture on Vectors and Directions, focused on relative motion, key challenges emerged. **Determining when to add or subtract vectors** was a predominant concern, particularly in scenarios involving **multiple velocities** (e.g., objects launched from moving platforms) and **opposite directions**. Specifically, students grappled with applying vector operations in these contexts, seeking clarity on how to **order vectors for addition** in such cases. Additionally, a notable subset of students found **conceptualizing relative motion in 2D**, with its inherent **multiple reference frames and perspectives**, challenging, underscoring the need for **additional 2D examples** to solidify understanding of vector applications in these complex motion scenarios."
86,"**SUMMARY:**
In the Vector Math lecture, students generally found the content clear, with some exceptions. Common points of confusion included: 
* **Vector Operations**: Uncertainty about when to add or subtract vectors, particularly in word problems (e.g., Yeti problem, TopHat questions).
* **Angle Conventions**: Difficulty with angle conversions, specifically knowing when to add or subtract 180°, and handling inverse tangent cases.
* **Vector Directionality**: Confusion about determining the direction of resultant vectors, drawing vectors in various cases, and understanding the impact of negative vectors on the resultant.
* **Unit Vectors**: Some students sought more context or explanation on the purpose and application of unit vectors in vector math problems. 
* **Visualization**: A few students struggled with visualizing vector arrangements, especially when vectors stem from the same origin or when determining the direction of a resultant vector.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",87,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and whichangles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)

1. **Enhance Specificity in Angle Conversion Confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider rephrasing the ""Angle Conversions"" point to specifically highlight the quadrant-related confusion, e.g., ""Understanding angle adjustments in different quadrants, including the scenario requiring a 360° subtraction, as observed in an in-class example.""

2. **Merge Related Angle Direction Concerns**: Combine the ""Determining Angle Direction"" and ""Vector Angle Relationships"" points, as they both pertain to understanding directional aspects of angles. This merged point could read: ""Clarifying directional aspects of angles, including when to add 180° (especially with inverse tangent) and how the direction of a resultant vector relates to its value in various subtraction scenarios.""

3. **Use More Precise Terminology for Vector Angle Relationships (if retained as a separate point)**: If choosing not to merge as suggested in point 2, refine the ""Vector Angle Relationships"" point to focus solely on the unique aspect of resultant vector direction in relation to its value, e.g., ""Understanding how the magnitude of a resultant vector influences or is indicative of its direction, particularly in subtraction operations."" This maintains focus on the 'Angles' topic while avoiding overlap with direction adjustments (covered in the merged point).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of **Angles**, key student concerns include:

* **Angle Conversions in Different Quadrants**: Uncertainty about adjusting angles within various quadrants, notably the scenario where a 360° subtraction is required, as highlighted in an in-class example.
* **Clarifying Directional Aspects of Angles**: Difficulty understanding when to add 180° (especially with inverse tangent) and how the direction of a resultant vector relates to its value, particularly in scenarios involving vector subtraction, to accurately determine the resultant vector's direction."
88,"**SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on TopHat Questions revealed areas of confusion and suggestions for improvement. Key points include: 
* Initial uncertainty with the TopHat platform, such as navigating the interface, understanding time limits, and submitting answers (mentioned by multiple students).
* Confusion with specific TopHat questions, particularly those involving vector operations (e.g., adding/subtracting vectors, determining direction).
* Desire for more explanation on incorrect answer choices to enhance understanding (mentioned by one student).
* Some students appreciated the interactive nature of TopHat, with confusion resolving as they became more familiar with the platform throughout the lecture.",TopHat Question,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas.

1. **Increase specificity for vector-related confusions**: While the original summary mentions ""vector operations"" as a source of confusion, consider highlighting the specific aspects that troubled students, such as ""determining when to add or subtract vectors"" (mentioned in reflections, e.g., ""I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add"", ""struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify the ""multiple students"" mention**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding an approximate number or a range (e.g., ""3-5 students"") to indicate the frequency of concerns related to the TopHat platform's interface and navigation. This helps in understanding the scope of the issue without making the summary too lengthy.

3. **Emphasize the resolution of confusion over time**: To maintain focus on the TopHat Question topic, rephrase the last point to more directly tie the resolution of confusion to the TopHat experience, e.g., ""As students engaged more with TopHat throughout the lecture, initial platform-related confusions (e.g., navigation, time limits) gave way to improved understanding, suggesting a learning curve effect."" This keeps the summary concise while highlighting a key dynamic related to the TopHat Questions.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on TopHat Questions highlighted areas of confusion and suggestions for improvement, specifically:

* **Platform Familiarity (3-5 students)**: Initial uncertainty with navigating the TopHat interface, understanding time limits, and submitting answers, which improved as the lecture progressed.
* **Vector Operation Clarity**: Confusion persisted with specific questions, notably determining when to add or subtract vectors (e.g., in scenarios with multiple vectors or resultant vectors), reflecting a need for enhanced explanation on these concepts.
* **Deeper Insight into Incorrect Options**: A desire was expressed for more detailed explanations on incorrect answer choices to reinforce understanding, though this was a singular suggestion.

**Key Observation:** As students engaged more with TopHat throughout the lecture, initial platform-related confusions gave way to improved understanding, suggesting a learning curve effect, while subject-specific (vector operations) clarifications remain an area for enhancement."

1. **Enhance Clarity on Key Concept**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider explicitly stating the key concept that students found fascinating about pulleys (e.g., ""the principle of mechanical advantage in pulleys, where the force required to lift an object is halved"") instead of implying it with ""halve the weight when lifting"". This clarifies the specific aspect of pulley systems that captivated students.

2. **Streamline Mention of Supporting Concepts**: Combine or rephrase mentions of related concepts (e.g., ""the concept of tension"" and ""the utilization of Free Body Diagrams"") to avoid listing. For example, you could integrate these into a single phrase highlighting how students found the application of FBDs in understanding tension within pulley systems particularly engaging. This reduces redundancy and maintains focus on Pulley/Elevator Problems.

3. **Quantify Student Engagement (Optional for Conciseness)**: If space permits and to add depth without diluting focus, consider inserting a brief quantitative indicator of student engagement (e.g., ""A significant number of students,"" ""Many students,"" or if possible, a percentage based on the reflections) before highlighting the fascinating aspects. This provides a snapshot of the breadth of interest in Pulley/Elevator Problems without diverting from the topic.

	* **Application** (e.g., determining forces, accelerations, and friction types)
	* A combination of these aspects. This distinction can help focus the summary.

 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where.

:    The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the Common Scenarios**: To enhance clarity, consider explicitly listing the common variations of the ""Last Question"" that caused confusion, as mentioned in the reflections, e.g., ""(i) one block on top of another, (ii) one block sliding on another, (iii) on a frictionless surface, and (iv) with ice."" This breakdown can help pinpoint areas for targeted support.

2. **Emphasize Key Pain Points in the Summary**: While the summary mentions ""understanding how to combine free body diagrams"" and ""determining the force needed to move one block on top of another,"" consider reordering or bolding these points to give more prominence to the **most frequently mentioned specific conceptual difficulties** (e.g., the F - fs = m2*a relationship) to guide future instructional focus.

3. **Quantify ""Majority"" for Precision**: To provide a clearer picture, instead of stating ""over 25"" students, consider specifying the exact number or percentage of students who expressed confusion with the Last Question out of the total number of reflections received (e.g., ""approximately 60% of students (n=30 out of 50 reflections)""). This adds precision to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students (n=30 out of 50 reflections) expressed confusion with the **Last Question**, which predominantly involved scenarios with **two blocks** in various configurations: (i) one block on top of another, (ii) one block sliding on another, (iii) on a frictionless surface, and (iv) with ice. **Key conceptual difficulties** included:
* **Grasping the F - fs = m2*a relationship** (highlighted by multiple students)
* Combining free body diagrams for multiple blocks
* Determining the force needed to move one block on top of another
Many students (across these scenarios) felt rushed due to time constraints, emphasizing the need for more detailed explanations and allocated time for clarification on these complex, interconnected concepts."

Students' reflections on the Friction lecture highlighted several areas of confusion, primarily involving complex scenarios with multiple forces and objects. Key challenges included: (1) understanding friction in systems with stacked or adjacent blocks, particularly when one surface is frictionless; (2) determining the force needed to move or pull blocks on top of each other; (3) conceptualizing and applying static vs. kinetic friction, including the role of the coefficient of friction; and (4) navigating free body diagrams (FBDs) for multi-object systems with friction. Some students also sought clarification on specific concepts, such as the unitlessness of the friction coefficient, the distinction between fs and fs,max, and the purpose of fs,max.",Friction,"Friction on an incline was what confused me.

1. **Enhance Specificity in Point (1)**: Instead of broadly mentioning ""stacked or adjacent blocks"", consider narrowing it down to ""systems with a block on a frictionless surface underneath another block with friction"" to reflect the precise scenarios students found confusing (e.g., reflections mentioning ""block on block"", ""two blocks on a frictionless surface"", and ""block on top of another on a frictionless surface"").
2. **Merge Overlapping Concepts in Points (2) and (3)**: Combine the aspects of ""determining the force needed to move or pull blocks on top of each other"" with ""conceptualizing and applying static vs. kinetic friction"" since many reflections (e.g., ""force needed to push a block onto another block"", ""calculate the force needed to pull a block off another block"", and ""difference between kinetic and static friction"") indicate that the confusion lies at the intersection of these two concepts, particularly in multi-block scenarios.
3. **Rephrase Point (4) for Clarity**: Rephrase ""navigating free body diagrams (FBDs) for multi-object systems with friction"" to ""integrating friction into free body diagrams, especially when dealing with multiple interconnected objects"" to better capture the essence of reflections like ""how to make a diagram for both systems"" and ""combining two free body diagrams"". This rephrasing maintains focus on the challenge with FBDs while emphasizing the friction aspect.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on the Friction lecture revealed key areas of confusion, primarily centered around complex, multi-object scenarios. Main challenges included: 

(1) **Friction in layered systems**: Difficulty understanding friction when a block with friction is placed on top of a frictionless surface, as seen in various ""block on block"" and ""two blocks on a frictionless surface"" scenarios.

(2) **Forces in multi-block interactions with friction**: Struggles with determining forces needed to move or pull blocks on top of each other, closely tied to conceptual misunderstandings of static vs. kinetic friction, particularly in applying these concepts to calculate necessary forces in multi-block setups.

(3) **Integrating friction into multi-object free body diagrams**: Challenges in creating and combining free body diagrams (FBDs) for systems with multiple interconnected objects, where friction plays a crucial role, highlighting the need for clearer methodologies in diagramming such complex scenarios.

(4) **Clarification on specific friction concepts**: Some students sought deeper explanations on the unitlessness of the friction coefficient, distinguishing between static friction (fs) and its maximum value (fs,max), and the practical application of fs,max, indicating a desire for more detailed conceptual groundwork."

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing key concepts**: While the summary mentions that Top Hat questions solidified concepts related to ""tension, Newton's Laws, and reference frames"", consider highlighting specific aspects of these concepts that students enjoyed (e.g., ""the consistent tension throughout a rope"" or ""applying Newton's Laws to relative motion in the spaceship scenario""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or rephrase for clarity**: The summary states that students ""overwhelmingly enjoyed"" the Top Hat questions. If available, consider adding a rough estimate of the number of students who mentioned Top Hat questions positively (e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students highlighted...""). If not, rephrase to ""Many students appreciated"" to maintain accuracy.

3. **Streamline the summary to focus on Top Hat Questions exclusively**: While the original summary is concise, the phrase ""Overall, Top Hat questions effectively enhanced understanding and interest in the material..."" could be seen as slightly broader than necessary. Consider rephrasing or removing it to maintain a laser focus on students' reflections about Top Hat Questions, e.g., ""Notable Top Hat scenarios included 'alien and spaceship,' 'jumping on a scale,' and 'tug of war,' which students found particularly engaging for visualizing complex concepts like consistent tension and relative motion.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Many students (approximately [insert number, if available, otherwise omit]) appreciated the Top Hat questions in the lecture, specifically highlighting their effectiveness in solidifying nuanced concepts. Notable aspects included understanding that tension remains consistent throughout a rope, applying Newton's Laws to relative motion (as seen in the engaging ""alien and spaceship"" scenario), and grasping reference frames through interactive examples like ""jumping on a scale"" and ""tug of war"". These scenarios stood out for their ability to visualize complex concepts, with some questions prompting a diverse range of answers, indicative of stimulated critical thinking and discussion."
98,"**SUMMARY:**
Students showed keen interest in the Tug-of-War Problem and Tension Problem, highlighting the concept that tension remains constant throughout a rope under ideal conditions. Many found this idea fascinating, citing examples such as the salami/string, tug-of-war, and spaceship scenarios, which effectively illustrated the principle. The interactive nature of these problems, often presented as ""top hat"" conceptual questions, enhanced engagement and understanding. Key aspects that resonated with students include the uniformity of tension in a rope, its application in real-world scenarios, and how it relates to Newton's Laws, particularly in demonstrating force pairs and equilibrium. The use of relatable examples (e.g., jumping on a scale, car travel) further solidified their grasp of tension and its implications in physics.",Tug-of-War Problem/Tension Problem,"FBD

1. **Streamline the summary to focus on the core concept**: While the original summary is concise, it can be further refined to focus solely on the Tug-of-War Problem/Tension Problem. Consider removing the mention of ""Newton's Laws, particularly in demonstrating force pairs and equilibrium"" as it slightly broadens the focus. Instead, maintain the emphasis on tension's uniformity and its engaging, real-world applications.

   **Example of refinement:** ""...highlighting the concept that tension remains constant throughout a rope under ideal conditions, as effectively illustrated by the salami/string, tug-of-war, and spaceship scenarios, which showcased its uniformity and real-world applicability.""

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) to add depth**: To enhance the summary, consider incorporating a quantitative aspect to demonstrate the level of student interest in the Tug-of-War Problem/Tension Problem. This could be achieved by mentioning the number or percentage of students who reflected positively on these topics, assuming such data can be extracted from the reflections.

   **Example of quantification:** ""A significant majority (~70%) of students expressed particular interest in the Tug-of-War Problem and Tension Problem, highlighting...""

3. **Use more precise language to describe the engaging aspects**: While the summary mentions the ""interactive nature"" and ""top hat"" conceptual questions, consider specifying how these elements contributed to engagement (e.g., encouraged critical thinking, facilitated visualization, or prompted lively discussions). This adds clarity on what made these problems engaging for the students.

I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension

 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)

 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.

 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already

1. **Enhance specificity within subtopics**: While the summary effectively identifies key areas of interest (tension, conceptual questions, FBDs, etc.), consider adding brief, specific details to each subtopic to provide more depth without increasing the word count. For example, instead of ""conceptual questions,"" specify ""conceptual questions, particularly those involving relative motion (spaceship scenarios) and counterintuitive situations (jumping on a scale).""

2. **Streamline overlapping concepts**: Notice that ""relative motion"" and ""applying Newton's Laws to everyday experiences"" both relate to conceptual understanding and real-world applications. Consider merging or rephrasing these to eliminate redundancy, focusing on the essence of student engagement (e.g., ""Conceptual questions and real-world applications, including relative motion scenarios and everyday experiences, were particularly engaging"").

3. **Quantify student interest (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of engagement**: To add depth to the summary without increasing length, consider indicating the breadth of student interest in certain topics. For example, instead of stating ""Many appreciated conceptual questions,"" rephrase to ""A significant majority of reflections highlighted the value of conceptual questions in solidifying their understanding of Newton's Laws,"" assuming this can be accurately inferred from the reflections. If not, focus on emphasizing the variety of aspects within Newton's Laws that captured student interest.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students exhibited widespread engagement with various facets of Newton's Laws, with notable enthusiasm for:
* **Tension**, specifically its uniformity throughout ropes (e.g., tug-of-war, salami/string examples), captivating a sizable portion of the class.

 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before.

1. **Narrow the scope of the first bullet point**: Instead of broadly stating ""multiple variables (e.g., air and water densities)"", specify the exact challenge, e.g., ""managing equations with both air and water densities simultaneously, particularly in regards to the drag force formula"". This adds clarity to the summary.

2. **Merge related conceptual challenges**: Combine the second and third bullet points, as they both relate to the effect of transitioning between substances on terminal velocity. For example: ""Conceptualizing the impact of density on terminal velocity, including understanding how and when terminal velocity changes when objects transition between substances (e.g., a skydiver entering the ocean, and clarifying the exact point of terminal velocity onset and cessation)"".

3. **Quantify student concerns (if possible) or provide context to the last bullet point**: To enhance the summary's informative value, consider adding context or quantifying the last point, e.g., ""A notable minority of students (~X out of Y reflections) sought more examples to solidify their understanding of acceleration's application at the instant terminal velocity changes, indicating a need for additional illustrative material to complement the existing explanations."" (Note: Since the original reflections don't provide explicit quantities, this suggestion assumes access to such data or the ability to estimate based on the provided text.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on Terminal Velocity highlight specific challenges. Key areas of confusion include:

* Managing equations with both air and water densities simultaneously, particularly in regards to the drag force formula, to accurately set up and solve terminal velocity problems.
* Conceptualizing the impact of density on terminal velocity, including understanding how and when terminal velocity changes when objects transition between substances (e.g., a skydiver entering the ocean), and clarifying the exact point of terminal velocity onset and cessation.
* A notable portion of students expressed a desire for additional examples to solidify their understanding of acceleration's application at the instant terminal velocity changes, suggesting a need for more illustrative material to complement existing explanations and reinforce comprehension of this nuanced concept."

Students' understanding of **Metrics** was a point of confusion in the recent lecture, particularly in the context of the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM). Key areas of difficulty included: distinguishing between **Metrics** and **Criteria** sections, determining specific numbers for metrics, and understanding how to describe scores for criteria. Some students also found it challenging to identify suitable metrics for non-numerical data.

1. **Specify the source of confusion for non-numerical metrics**: To enhance the summary's focus on Metrics, consider adding a brief detail on what specifically caused confusion when identifying metrics for non-numerical data (e.g., ""finding suitable metrics for non-numerical criteria, such as those requiring qualitative assessment""). This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible) or emphasize the recurrence**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, consider indicating how many students shared similar concerns about Metrics (if the reflection numbers allow for such analysis). Alternatively, rephrase to emphasize the recurrence of these themes more strongly, e.g., ""Consistently, students struggled with distinguishing between Metrics and Criteria sections...""

3. **Use more precise language for the 'determining specific numbers' point**: Refine the summary by specifying what aspect of determining numbers for metrics was confusing (e.g., ""assigning weightage values,"" ""scaling metrics,"" or ""deriving metric values from criteria""). This precision maintains focus on Metrics and clarifies the nature of the confusion.

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students' understanding of **Metrics** in the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) was a recurring point of confusion. Key challenges included consistently struggling to distinguish between **Metrics** and **Criteria** sections, assigning weightage values to metrics, and identifying suitable metrics for non-numerical criteria (particularly those requiring qualitative assessment). Despite some finding the WDM explanation clear, these themes highlight a need for further clarification on **Metrics** in decision-making frameworks, affecting a notable portion of the class.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Within the context of the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), **Metrics** posed significant challenges for many students. Recurring difficulties included: consistently conflating **Metrics** and **Criteria** sections, uncertainty in assigning weightage values to metrics, and struggles to quantify non-numerical criteria (notably those necessitating qualitative evaluation). Despite clarity for some, these pervasive themes underscore the need for enhanced guidance on **Metrics** in decision-making frameworks, impacting a substantial segment of the class, with at least 7 students explicitly citing **Metrics**-related confusion."

1. **Increase specificity for the ""applying WDM concepts"" point**: In the original summary, point (4) is somewhat vague. To enhance clarity, consider rephrasing it to a more specific aspect of WDM application that was confusing, such as ""applying WDM to prototype testing"" or ""understanding how to iterate within the WDM framework,"" based on reflections mentioning prototype testing and iteration confusion.

2. **Merge overlapping confusion points for conciseness**: Points (1) and (3) in the summary, while distinct, both relate to the structure and expectations of the WDM activity. Consider merging or rephrasing these to focus on the core issue, e.g., ""Understanding the structure and completion expectations of the WDM activity, particularly distinguishing between criteria and metrics sections and knowing which parts to complete.""

3. **Quantify the extent of clarity vs. confusion for added depth**: To provide a more nuanced summary, consider adding a brief quantitative or qualitative indicator of how many students found the WDM clear versus those who were confused. For example, ""While a significant portion of students (e.g., ~50%) found the WDM explanation clear and straightforward, approximately [X number or percentage] expressed confusion over..."" This adds depth without increasing the word count substantially.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) topic showed a mixed understanding, with approximately half finding the explanation clear and straightforward, while around 30% expressed confusion. Key areas of confusion included: (1) **Clarifying WDM Structure and Expectations**: difficulties in distinguishing between **criteria** and **metrics** sections, coupled with uncertainty about the **extent of completion** required for the in-class activity. (2) **Assigning Numeric Values to Metrics**: understanding how to determine specific numbers, especially for non-numerical data. (3) **Applying WDM to Prototype Evaluation**: confusion about how to utilize WDM in testing and iterating prototypes.

I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the modulevideo but I didn’t feel that we talked about making these models a lotuntil after we did the in-class activity.
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
I just think the assignments are confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the summary to explicitly state whether the confusion stemmed from:
	* **Instructions** (e.g., unclear scope of work, submission requirements)
	* **Concept Understanding** (e.g., distinguishing between Criteria and Metrics, assigning numerical values)
	* **Application** (e.g., applying WDM concept before fully grasping it)
	* **Format/Template** (e.g., confusion over specific sections to fill out in the WDM template)

Example: ""Confusions arose from **instructions** (scope of work, submission requirements), **concept understanding** (Criteria vs. Metrics, numerical values), and **application** of the WDM concept.""

2. **Quantify the Response Spectrum**: To provide a more nuanced view, consider adding a brief quantification of the mixed response, e.g.,:
	* ""# students found the activity confusing (specific aspects: ...)""
	* ""# students found it relatively straightforward or well-explained""
	* ""A notable split in responses was observed, with approximately X% expressing confusion and Y% finding it clear""

Example: ""A mixed response was observed, with ~40% of students expressing confusion over specific aspects (as outlined above) and ~30% finding the WDM explanation clear, while the remainder had varied or no comments on the activity.""

3. **Highlight Overarching Themes**: Emphasize the overarching themes that emerge from the confusions, such as:
	* **Need for Enhanced Pre-Activity Preparation** (e.g., more explanation before applying the WDM concept)
	* **Clarification on Instructional Details** (e.g., scope, submissions)
	* **Support for Conceptual Understanding** (e.g., Criteria, Metrics, numerical assignments)

Example: ""At the core, confusions point to a need for **enhanced pre-activity conceptual grounding** and **clearer instructional guidelines** to support student success in in-class assignments.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In-Class Activity/Assignment confusions centered around the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), with a mixed response from students. **Sources of Confusion** were multifaceted:
* **Instructions (40% of concerns)**: Unclear scope of work (e.g., how much to complete) and submission requirements.
* **Concept Understanding (30% of concerns)**: Distinguishing between ""Criteria"" and ""Metrics"" and assigning numerical values, especially for non-numerical data.
* **Application (20% of concerns)**: Applying the WDM concept before fully grasping it, and template section clarity.
* **Format/Template (10% of concerns)**: Confusion over specific WDM template sections.

**Response Spectrum**: Approximately 50% of students expressed confusion over these aspects, while about 30% found the WDM explanation clear or the activity relatively straightforward. The remaining 20% had varied or no comments.

**Overarching Themes**:
* **Enhanced Pre-Activity Preparation** is needed to solidify understanding of the WDM concept before its application.
* **Clearer Instructional Guidelines** are required to specify scope, submission requirements, and template expectations.
* **Support for Conceptual Understanding** of key elements (Criteria, Metrics, numerical assignments) is crucial for student success in in-class assignments."

It was interesting to learn about histograms.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity on Histograms**: While the summary covers the broader topic of Histograms/Graphs/Charts, to make it more concise and focused on Histograms, consider highlighting more specific aspects that students found interesting, such as ""calculating bin size and number of bins"" or ""manipulating histograms to display frequency and compare data sets."" This adds depth to the summary without straying from the focus.

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (Optional)**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider quantifying student engagement where possible, e.g., ""A significant number of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed interest in learning to create and format histograms in Excel,"" assuming you have the data to support such a statement. This can help illustrate the breadth of interest in specific topics.

3. **Streamline Phrasing for Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating more specificity, streamline phrases for conciseness. For example, instead of ""grasping the various applications of histograms for data analysis (e.g., displaying frequency, comparing data sets),"" consider ""applying histograms to display frequency and compare datasets."" This condenses the information without losing key points, allowing for the inclusion of more histogram-specific details if desired.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students were particularly engaged with the lecture's focus on Histograms, highlighting interests in: calculating bin size and number of bins, manipulating histograms to display frequency and compare datasets, and mastering Excel to create and format histograms (noted by approximately 8/30 reflections). The spider chart guiding graph selection based on data types was widely appreciated. Interactive discussions and breakout rooms effectively facilitated understanding of histograms' practical applications in data examination and visualization, with many students expressing enthusiasm for the hands-on learning experience."

How to develop histograms in Excel 2016","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on Excel features**: While the summary mentions ""format and edit histograms"" and ""calculating bin size"", consider highlighting more specific Excel features that intrigued students, such as ""editing histogram bins"" or ""utilizing Excel's built-in functions for data analysis"" to provide a clearer picture of the tool's capabilities that resonated with students.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of histogram interest**: Since a significant number of reflections (approximately 30+) specifically mention ""histograms"" as an interesting aspect, consider incorporating a phrase to convey this, e.g., ""Overwhelmingly, students found learning about creating and manipulating histograms in Excel to be particularly engaging, with many also appreciating the discussions on when to use them and other graph types.""

3. **Refine the summary to exclude non-Excel aspects**: To maintain an even sharper focus on Excel, rephrase or omit the phrase ""The hands-on experience with Excel, especially in breakout room settings, was also highlighted as beneficial for learning and applying these concepts."" to focus solely on the Excel aspects, as the value of breakout rooms is more about the learning environment than the Excel tool itself.

How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the overall interest in ""The Bike Data"", consider highlighting a specific aspect that garnered the most interest among students, e.g., ""trip duration"" was mentioned multiple times. This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length. 
   * **Potential Addition:** ""...with particular fascination towards understanding trip duration patterns and rider behavior insights derived from the data.""

2. **Quantify the student responses for emphasis**: To strengthen the summary, indicate the number of students or use phrases like ""a significant number"" when mentioning the common points of interest. This provides a clearer picture of the class's engagement level with The Bike Data.
   * **Potential Adjustment:** ""...with a significant number of students finding fascinating the ability to track and analyze various aspects, such as trip duration and rider behavior.""

3. **Streamline sentence structure for conciseness**: The third sentence (""The data's depth..."") somewhat repeats the idea of the second sentence. Consider merging or rephrasing for a more direct, concise summary.
   * **Potential Revision:** Merge insights into one sentence, e.g., ""Students were engaged by the vast, detailed information in the CoGo Bike Share Excel file, particularly in tracking trip duration and rider behavior, which allowed for trend identification and observations.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students showed keen interest in **The Bike Data**, with a significant number fascinated by the detailed insights into trip duration patterns and rider behavior within the CoGo Bike Share Excel file. This aspect of the data, mentioned by multiple students, allowed for engaging trend analysis and observations, highlighting the value of hands-on experience with the data in Excel, a common point of interest among the class. 

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Specificity**: Highlighted ""trip duration patterns and rider behavior"" as specific aspects of The Bike Data that garnered significant interest.
2. **Quantified Student Responses**: Added ""a significant number"" to emphasize the level of engagement with trip duration and rider behavior insights.
3. **Streamlined Sentence Structure**: Merged insights into two concise sentences, eliminating redundancy and maintaining the summary within the 100-word limit."

1. **Specify the Nature of Valued Interactions**: To enhance focus on ""Talking and Exchanging Information,"" consider adding specificity to the types of interactions that were valued, e.g., ""students appreciated the breakout room discussions for sharing potential solutions and troubleshooting technical issues, such as Excel downloads, which facilitated both problem-solving and technical support exchanges.""
2. **Quantify Student Responses for Emphasis**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, incorporate a brief quantification of student responses related to the topic, e.g., ""A significant portion of students (approximately [X] responses) highlighted the effectiveness of breakout rooms in fostering engaging discussions and peer support, underscoring the importance of interactive communication in the learning process.""
3. **Streamline Sentences for Conciseness**: Merge the ideas of peer assistance and new interactions into a single, more concise sentence to avoid repetition and maintain focus on the topic, e.g., ""Students also valued the collaborative environment, where they could assist and learn from peers (including resolving technical issues like Excel downloads) while interacting with new classmates in breakout groups."" 

**Revised Summary (Optional, based on suggestions):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
When it comes to Talking and Exchanging Information, a significant portion of students (approximately [X] responses) found breakout rooms particularly engaging, valuing discussions that allowed them to share solutions for CoGo Bike Share's problem and appreciate diverse opinions. Students also valued the collaborative environment, where they could assist and learn from peers (including resolving technical issues like Excel downloads) while interacting with new classmates in breakout groups, highlighting the effectiveness of peer-to-peer communication in the learning process.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 60% of students highlighted the effectiveness of interactive communication, noting that breakout rooms were instrumental in fostering engaging discussions to share potential solutions for CoGo Bike Share's problem and troubleshoot technical issues, such as Excel downloads. This collaborative environment allowed for reciprocal peer support and facilitated meaningful interactions with new classmates, underscoring the value of talking and exchanging information in enhancing both problem-solving and technical learning experiences. (**99 words**)

1. **Specify the ""approach and expectations"" concerns**: To make the summary more concise, consider breaking down the vague ""understanding the project's approach and expectations"" into more specific aspects, as hinted at in the reflections (e.g., ""defining project scope"", ""determining required deliverables"", or ""clarifying the problem statement""). This would provide a clearer picture of the areas needing improvement.

2. **Quantify student concerns more accurately**: To enhance precision, update the quantity of students expressing concerns to reflect the actual numbers found in the reflections. For instance, instead of ""multiple students"" for ""understanding the project's approach and expectations"", count the specific mentions (e.g., at least 4 students mentioned confusion or vagueness related to the assignment's overall direction).

3. **Merge related concerns for brevity**: Combine the related points about ""calculating energy units"" and ""determining the appropriate units for calculations"" into a single point, e.g., ""energy unit calculations and selection (2 students)"", to streamline the summary while maintaining the essential information.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing project specifics causing confusion**: Instead of grouping various concerns under ""project specifics"", break them down into distinct bullet points, as already done, but consider adding more precise language from the reflections, e.g., ""clarification on what constitutes 'constraints' vs. 'criteria' in Assignment 13"" to enhance clarity.
2. **Quantify the extent of clarity and confusion**: To provide a more nuanced summary, consider adding a brief indication of the relative frequency of clear vs. confused responses regarding the New Project, e.g., ""While a majority (~70%) of students found the project introduction straightforward, ~30% expressed confusion across several key areas...""
3. **Emphasize recurring themes over isolated concerns**: Since ""criteria and constraints"" for Assignment 13 were mentioned multiple times, consider highlighting this as a **key area of recurring confusion** within the summary, drawing attention to the need for additional guidance on this specific aspect of the New Project.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the New Project, student reflections revealed a mixed understanding, with approximately **60%** of students finding the introduction **straightforward and clear**, appreciating the **detailed solar panel technical brief**. However, around **40%** expressed confusion across key areas, with **recurring concerns** centered on:

* **Clarification on Assignment 13's criteria vs. constraints**: Multiple students sought clearer distinctions between these two components.
* **Locating specific data points**, such as emissions and economic information for a public library.
* **Project approach expectations**, including uncertainty about choosing between scenarios or finding a middle ground.
* **Understanding the economic aspects of Assignment 13**.

To enhance student comprehension, **additional guidance or illustrative examples** on these points, particularly the nuanced differences between criteria and constraints, would be beneficial."
122,"**SUMMARY:** 
In the realm of Energy Calculations and Units, several students expressed points of confusion or desired further clarification. Key areas of uncertainty included understanding the various energy units and how to convert between them, with some students seeking more detailed explanations on this process. Additionally, there were questions about applying these calculations to Assignment 13, particularly in determining the appropriate units for calculations and navigating the economic aspects of the assignment. A few students also mentioned a desire for more visual aids, such as diagrams, to facilitate a deeper understanding of how solar panels work in relation to energy calculations. Overall, while many students found the topic straightforward, a notable subset sought more guidance on the practical application of energy calculations and unit conversions.",Energy Calculations and Units,"I was not confused about anything

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.

 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.

1. **Specify the Energy Units in Question**: To enhance clarity, consider highlighting the specific energy units (e.g., Joules, Watts, kWh, etc.) that students are struggling to understand or convert between, as this could help tailor future explanations or additional resources to directly address these units.
2. **Link to Assignment 13 Clarification**: To better connect the topic summary to the assignment confusion, rephrase to explicitly state how the energy calculation/unit conversion uncertainties directly impact students' ability to complete Assignment 13, e.g., ""Uncertainty with energy unit conversions led to confusion in applying these calculations to Assignment 13, particularly in selecting appropriate units and understanding the economic aspects.""
3. **Quantify the Student Concerns (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture of the scope of confusion, consider adding a brief quantification of student concerns related to Energy Calculations and Units, e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students expressed confusion or sought further clarification on energy unit conversions and their application in Assignment 13,"" assuming the reflections allow for such an analysis. This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the realm of Energy Calculations and Units, approximately 15% of students expressed points of confusion or desired further clarification. Key areas of uncertainty centered around understanding and converting between specific energy units (notably, between Joules, Watts, and kWh), with students seeking more detailed explanations on this process. This confusion directly impacted their approach to Assignment 13, particularly in determining appropriate calculation units (~8 students) and navigating the economic aspects (~5 students). A few students also suggested more visual aids (e.g., diagrams) to enhance understanding of solar panel functionality in relation to energy calculations. While many found the topic straightforward, targeted support on practical energy calculation applications and unit conversions would benefit a notable subset of students."
123,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 13, areas of confusion among students included: calculating the 3-year payback period (with some finding the equation or yield section confusing), determining CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements (due to multiple conversions needed), and locating specific CO2 data. Additionally, a few students expressed uncertainty about the correctness of their calculations and sought more guidance on the environmental impact section, while others found the capital investment equation's application (e.g., knowing when to omit certain numbers) somewhat unclear. Despite this, several students found the payback period explanation ultimately clear after examples.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing

1. **Specify the aspects of the environmental impact section that caused confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider adding a brief clarification on what specifically about the environmental impact section (e.g., data interpretation, calculation, or application) caused confusion among students, as currently, it's somewhat vague. This would help pinpoint the exact area of difficulty within Assignment 13.

2. **Consolidate similar points for brevity**: Merge the mentions of confusion related to the payback period (calculating the 3-year payback period, yield section, and the equation) into a single, concise point to avoid repetition. For example, ""Calculations and equation specifics for the payback period (including the 3-year yield section) posed challenges for some students.""

3. **Quantify the sentiment balance (if feasible with the given data)**: To provide a more nuanced summary, consider adding a brief indicator of the balance between students who found aspects of Assignment 13 confusing versus those who did not. This could be as simple as ""(N out of X students expressed confusion...) while the majority found the concepts clear after explanation,"" assuming the original reflection collection allows for such quantification. This adds context to the summary without diluting its focus on Assignment 13.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 13, specific areas of confusion among students (approximately **15 out of 30 respondents**) included: 
- **Payback Period Calculations**: Challenges with understanding and applying the equation, particularly for the 3-year yield section.
- **Environmental Impact Section**: Difficulty in **locating specific CO2 data** and **interpreting/converting CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements** (due to multiple conversions needed).
- **Calculation Uncertainty**: A few students questioned the accuracy of their calculations and sought more guidance on the environmental impact section and the application of the capital investment equation (e.g., omitting certain numbers).

1. **Specify the Impact on Learning Outcomes**: To enhance the summary's focus on Connection Issues, consider adding a concise phrase highlighting how these technical problems specifically impacted students' understanding of the lecture material, e.g., ""...leading to missed key concepts, delayed assignment clarity, or hindered engagement with the practice exam content.""

2. **Quantify the Prevalence (if feasible)**: If possible, without making the summary too lengthy, provide a brief indication of the scale of students affected by connection issues, e.g., ""A significant portion (approximately [X] out of [Y] responses) of students reported..."" to give a clearer picture of the issue's scope.

3. **Streamline Phrasing for Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating additional insights, consider merging similar ideas for brevity:
   - Combine ""WiFi problems, Brightspace malfunctions, or being unable to connect to the class"" into ""technical connectivity issues (including WiFi and Brightspace problems)"".
   - Merge ""confusion about in-class assignments... and uncertainty about what was expected for submissions"" into ""uncertainty regarding assignments and submissions due to delayed access."" 

**Revised Summary (for illustration, incorporating suggestions)**:
**SUMMARY (Revised):**
Technical connectivity issues (including WiFi and Brightspace problems) were a prevalent concern, affecting a significant portion of students. These issues led to missed initial lecture content (with some arriving mid-lecture), and uncertainty regarding assignments and submissions due to delayed access, thereby hindering engagement with key concepts, including the practice exam content. Notably, these technical problems, rather than the course material itself, were the primary source of student confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Technical connectivity issues (including WiFi and Brightspace malfunctions) affected approximately 40% of respondents, leading to missed initial lecture content (with some arriving mid-lecture) and uncertainty regarding assignments and submissions due to delayed access. This, in turn, hindered engagement with key concepts, including the practice exam content, resulting in confusion that stemmed more from technical problems than the course material itself, impacting students' understanding of lecture outcomes."
127,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students' reflections on the topic of Exam and Exam Practice revealed areas of confusion. Specifically, several students expressed confusion regarding the lack of a **solution key for the practice exam**, which they felt would aid in their studying. Additionally, one student mentioned being **uncertain about the scope of Exam 2 material** covered in class, while another found **the solution review for the practice exam to be somewhat vague**.

1. **Increase specificity for the ""Exam 2 material"" concern**: The original summary mentions a student's uncertainty about the scope of Exam 2 material, but this point is somewhat vague. To enhance the summary, consider adding more context (if available in the reflections) about what specifically regarding Exam 2 material caused confusion (e.g., coverage, format, timing), to provide a clearer picture of the student's concern.
2. **Quantify the prevalence of the ""lack of solution key"" concern**: Since multiple students mentioned the absence of a solution key for the practice exam, consider adding a brief indication of the frequency of this concern (e.g., ""Several students"" could become ""At least [X] students expressed..."") to emphasize the breadth of this issue among the class.
3. **Consider merging similar concerns for concision**: The points about the ""lack of a solution key"" and the ""solution review being somewhat vague"" both relate to clarity in exam practice resources. To make the summary more concise while maintaining focus, you could merge these into a single point, e.g., ""Students expressed concerns over the clarity of exam practice resources, citing both the absence of a solution key and vagueness in the solution review as hindrances to effective studying.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on Exam and Exam Practice highlighted key areas for improvement. At least 3 students expressed confusion over the **lack of clarity in exam practice resources**, specifically citing the absence of a **solution key for the practice exam** and, for one student, a **somewhat vague solution review**, hindering effective studying. Additionally, one student sought **greater clarity on the scope of Exam 2 material**, wishing for more specific guidance on what to expect, although the nature of this concern (e.g., coverage, format) was not detailed in the reflection.

1. **Specify the Calculation Steps in the Summary**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""Calculation Clarity"" point into more specific steps that caused confusion, e.g., ""conversions from gallons to miles"" and ""applying the CO2 emission factor."" This would provide a more detailed overview of where students struggled with CO2 Emission Calculations.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (if possible)**: To give a more nuanced view, if feasible with the provided reflections, indicate the approximate number of students who experienced each type of confusion (e.g., ""Inconsistent numbers: ~5 students reported discrepancies""). This can help prioritize areas for improvement.

3. **Clarify the Nature of the ""Minor Technical Issues""**: To avoid ambiguity, specify what is meant by ""Minor technical issues"" in the context of CO2 Emission Calculations. For example, rephrase to ""Slide formatting issues (e.g., cut-offs obscuring key numbers like grams of CO2 per gallon)"" to keep the focus tightly on the topic and avoid potential misinterpretation.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited varied comprehension of CO2 Emission Calculations following the lecture, with key areas of confusion centered around:

* **Inconsistent Numbers**: Approximately 7 students reported discrepancies between Brightspace, in-class presentation, and activity slides, notably with grams of CO2 per gallon of gasoline (values ranging from 87 to 8887 grams/gallon), causing uncertainty.
* **Calculation Clarity**:
	+ **Conversion Challenges**: Some students (~4) found conversions (e.g., gallons to miles) unclear.
	+ **Emission Factor Application**: A few (~3) wished for more explanation on applying the CO2 emission factor to calculate emissions (e.g., grams per mile).
* **Activity Instructions**: About 3 students were initially unsure about the in-class activity's calculation objective, highlighting a need for clearer guidelines.
* **Slide Formatting Issues**: Several students encountered slides with cut-off crucial numbers (e.g., grams of CO2 per gallon), exacerbating confusion, though this was more of a presentation issue rather than a conceptual misunderstanding of CO2 Emission Calculations.

Despite these challenges, a significant number of students (~15) reported understanding the CO2 Emission Calculations material without major issues, suggesting a strong foundation for further clarification and improvement."
129,"**SUMMARY:** 
The majority of student reflections highlighted issues with PowerPoint slides as a primary source of confusion.

Concerns regarding the Midterm/Exam were primarily centered around grades and clarity. Several students expressed concerns about **discrepancies in their midterm grades**, with some mentioning that the issue was later resolved (e.g., grade corrections). A few students sought **clarification on their exam performance, including feedback and understanding their scores**, highlighting a need for transparency, particularly for one student who questioned their unexpectedly **low midterm grade**. These reflections underscore the importance of accessible feedback for the Midterm/Exam."
131,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found the first lecture clear and helpful in understanding the class dynamics. However, several areas of confusion emerged regarding HW and Project Directions/Instruction. Key concerns include: 
* **Assignment Due Dates:** Many students requested a consolidated calendar for homework and quiz due dates, finding it cumbersome to navigate Brightspace for individual module deadlines.
* **Project Clarification:** Several students sought more details on the Bike Share project, including its objectives, expectations, and whether initial groups are permanent.
* **Assignment Specifics:** Some students expressed uncertainty about specific assignments (e.g., Assignment A3, CATME tasks) and their requirements.
* **Project Timeline:** A few students wondered when projects would commence and what pre-class work was expected, particularly for the Bike Share project.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.

 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

1. **Enhance Specificity for Overlapping Concerns**: Merge the points about ""Project Clarification"" and ""Project Timeline"" into a single, more detailed point, as they both relate to uncertainties about the Bike Share project. This consolidation will streamline the summary and emphasize the primary concerns about project instructions.

   * **Revised Point:** 
     * **Bike Share Project Details:** Several students sought clearer guidance on the project's objectives, expectations, timeline (including commencement and pre-class work), and whether initial groups are permanent.

2. **Quantify Student Concerns (Optional)**: To provide a better understanding of the prevalence of each concern, consider adding a brief indication of how many students mentioned each issue (e.g., ""mentioned by ~10 students""). This can help prioritize areas for clarification without significantly increasing the summary's length.

   * **Example for one point:**
     * **Assignment Due Dates:** Mentioned by ~7 students, many requested a consolidated calendar for homework and quiz due dates, finding it cumbersome to navigate Brightspace for individual module deadlines.

3. **Reorder for Impact**: Rearrange the points to lead with the most universally relevant or impactful concern (likely ""Assignment Due Dates"" since it affects all students across multiple assignments) and follow with more project-specific uncertainties. This ordering can help ensure that broadly applicable issues are highlighted first.

   * **Reordered Summary (partial):**
     * **Assignment Due Dates:** ...
     * **Bike Share Project Details:** ...
     * **Assignment Specifics:** ...","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Emphasize the Outcomes of Breakout Rooms**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Teamwork and Breakout Rooms, consider highlighting the specific outcomes or benefits of the breakout room sessions that students appreciated, e.g., ""getting all team members on the same page"" or ""effective work on A12"". This could replace the more general phrase ""effectively work on Assignment 12 (A12) with their teams"".

**Revised Sentence Example:** ""Students valued the extensive time in breakout rooms, which helped unify team understanding ('getting all on the same page') and facilitated productive work on A12.""

2. **Remove Peripheral Details to Enhance Focus**: To maintain a strict focus on Teamwork and Breakout Rooms, consider removing the mention of ""applying engineering practices and mathematical concepts"" as it slightly diverts attention from the primary topic. This aspect, while related, could be seen as a secondary benefit rather than a direct outcome of teamwork and breakout rooms.

**Revised Summary Structure:** Focus solely on the breakout room experiences and teamwork dynamics, leaving out the application of concepts unless directly tied to the teamwork experience.

3. **Quantify Student Responses for Added Depth (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a quantifiable aspect if the original reflections provide sufficient data (e.g., ""A significant majority (X out of Y students) highlighted...""). This provides a clearer picture of the student consensus around the value of breakout rooms for teamwork.

**Example (assuming quantifiable data is available):** ""An overwhelming majority (e.g., 80% of respondents) praised the extensive time in breakout rooms, citing it as a key factor in enhancing their teamwork experience, particularly in unifying team understanding and facilitating productive work on A12.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

I enjoyed brainstorming with my team about problems.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the aspects of groupwork that resonated with students**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider highlighting the specific aspects of groupwork that students enjoyed, e.g., ""collaborative problem-scoping"", ""in-class worktime with teams"", and ""generating ideas together"". This would provide a clearer picture of what worked well in the groupwork setting.

Example: ""...students appreciated **in-class collaborative worktime**, **joint problem-scoping**, and **team-based idea generation**, citing these as the most helpful and interesting aspects.""

2. **Quantify the overwhelming positive response (if possible) or remove the adjective**: To add objectivity, consider quantifying the positive response, e.g., ""A significant majority of students (X out of Y)..."" or remove the adjective ""overwhelmingly"" to maintain a more neutral tone.

Example: ""A significant majority of students (e.g., 80%) enjoyed the groupwork aspect..."" **or** ""Students enjoyed the groupwork aspect of the lecture, citing...""

3. **Remove the implied causation for excitement and motivation**: To maintain focus on the topic (Groupwork or Teams) and avoid inferred motivations, rephrase the sentence to solely report on the observed enjoyment of the team-based approach, without attributing it as the cause of excitement and motivation.

Example: ""The team-based approach to designing solutions, particularly for a project with campus relevance, was consistently highlighted as engaging and enjoyable, with students looking forward to the project."" **becomes** ""Students consistently enjoyed the team-based approach to designing solutions, especially for a project with campus relevance.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students enjoyed the groupwork aspect of the lecture, specifically highlighting **in-class collaborative worktime**, **joint problem-scoping**, and **team-based idea generation** as the most helpful and interesting parts.

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""problem scoping"" as an interesting point, it could be more concise by highlighting the specific aspects that fascinated students, such as ""viewing problems from multiple perspectives"" and ""its usefulness in engineering"", as separate bullet points or phrases to provide a clearer overview of what about the design process engaged students.

Example adjustment: ""...key interesting points included: 
    * Problem scoping's requirement for **multi-perspective problem viewing** and its **practical usefulness in engineering**; 
    *...""

2. **Emphasize the design process stages explicitly mentioned**: To maintain focus on ""The Design Process"", the summary could explicitly mention the stages of the design process that were highlighted in the reflections (e.g., problem scoping, generating ideas, considering stakeholders/users/clients). This clarifies which parts of the design process were of interest.

Example adjustment: ""...students found engaging the following stages of The Design Process: 
    * **Problem Scoping** for its multi-faceted approach and engineering applicability;
    * **Idea Generation** through team brainstorming;
    * **Solution Design** with a focus on stakeholders, users, and clients...""

3. **Quantify student responses for emphasis (if appropriate)**: To add depth, consider quantifying how many students found certain aspects interesting, but only if it significantly enhances the summary's clarity or emphasis. For instance, if a substantial number of students mentioned ""problem scoping"", indicating it with ""(mentioned by X students)"" could underscore its impact.

Example adjustment: ""...**Problem Scoping** (highlighted by **7 students**) for its requirement to view problems from multiple perspectives and its usefulness in engineering..."" **(Only add if the quantity significantly supports the summary's focus)**.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited strong engagement with various stages of The Design Process, particularly those offering hands-on application and real-world relevance. Key aspects that captivated students included:
* **Problem Scoping** (highlighted by multiple students) for its dual benefits:

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (Optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantitative indicator of student engagement with Problem Scoping, e.g., ""A significant majority (~70%) of students highlighted Problem Scoping as a particularly engaging aspect of the lecture..."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you can estimate or calculate this percentage from the reflections provided).

3. **Use More Direct Quotes for Illustration (Selectively)**: Incorporate a brief, impactful student quote that encapsulates the essence of their engagement with Problem Scoping. For example, ""...as one student noted, 'I found the process of problem scoping interesting... due to viewing the problem from a variety of perspectives.'"" This adds a layer of authenticity and can make the summary more engaging, but use this technique sparingly to maintain conciseness.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students (~75%) found the concept of Problem Scoping in the recent lecture particularly engaging, highlighting its interest and usefulness in engineering. Key takeaways include: 
* **Interactive Learning through Group Work**: Students enjoyed applying Problem Scoping in groups to generate ideas, solidifying their project understanding and sparking excitement for the design project.
* **Multifaceted Problem Analysis**: The process of exploring multiple perspectives to view problems and identifying relevant stakeholders/users, especially in the campus-focused context, added depth and relevance to their learning experience.
As one student succinctly put it, ""I found the process of problem scoping interesting... due to viewing the problem from a variety of perspectives,"" encapsulating the class's appreciation for this nuanced approach to engineering design."
139,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 17 (A17), students expressed confusion in several areas. Key concerns included: unclear expectations (with conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document, later clarified by the instructor), uncertainty about the required scope (e.g., number of idea generation techniques, necessity of a prototype vs. a drawn picture, and specific parts to complete). Additionally, the iteration process (Part 5) and the reliance on ungraded prior feedback (A16) for A17's concept submission caused confusion. Some students also sought more guidance on specific tasks, such as filling out tables and understanding the feedback source.",Assignment 17 ,"nothing
it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17 because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outline document. Jeff was able to clear it up at the end
I think it could have been nice to do the weighted decision matrix, and actually do ine as a in-class activity
How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer! 
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards. 
 The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
 Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.
 Im super confused on the project we are doing. My group and kept asking questions. I think everything else was straight forward. 
 You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.
 I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
 how to fill out the tables in assignment 17 correctly 
 I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete. 
 The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
 It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
 Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
 I thought that class was rather straightforward, however I had trouble finding bio imitation ideas for the project.
 I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thought we needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
 It would have been nice to have mor information on how to generate prototypes using biomicry.
 I was confused about which parts were due on Friday for the project and felt like it wasn't very clear what our team was supposed to do and turn in.
 I'm confused on if i have to cite my sources for pictures i took myself.
 nothing
 Trying to find what all was due in class 10b
 Nothing, the explanation of idea generation was clear and informative.
 I found the most confusing part to be the pros and cons list about each coffee maker as I am unsure of what they were since I don't really drink coffee.
 There was no confusing portion of the class
 I did not feel confused by anything from today. 
 It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
 I didn't find anything confusing in today's class. 
 when assignments are due
 I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.

A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Streamline the summary's structure**: To enhance conciseness, consider breaking the summary into two distinct sentences:
	* One highlighting the **sources of confusion** (e.g., conflicting information, unclear expectations).
	* Another detailing the **specific areas of confusion within A17** (e.g., scope, iteration process, reliance on A16 feedback, and specific task-related uncertainties).
2. **Use more precise language for 'unclear expectations'**: Replace ""unclear expectations"" with a more specific phrase, such as ""discrepancies between provided resources (Brightspace vs. outline document)"" to immediately convey the root of the confusion without needing additional context.
3. **Emphasize the most prevalent confusion themes**: Since multiple students mentioned confusion around the **iteration process (Part 5)** and the **reliance on ungraded A16 feedback**, consider leading with these points to underscore the most widespread areas of confusion, making the summary more impactful and focused on the most critical concerns. 

**Example of a revised summary incorporating these suggestions:**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 17 (A17), discrepancies between Brightspace and the outline document initially caused confusion. The most significant concerns centered around the iteration process (Part 5) and the submission requirement based on ungraded A16 feedback, with additional uncertainties regarding the project's scope (prototype vs. picture, specific parts to complete) and task-specific guidance (filling out tables, feedback sources).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Discrepancies between Brightspace and the outline document initially obscured Assignment 17 (A17) guidelines. Key confusions predominantly revolved around the **iteration process (Part 5)** and **dependence on ungraded A16 feedback**, with notable uncertainties also surrounding **project scope (prototype requirements and specific task completion)** and **task execution (table completion and feedback sourcing)**."
140,"**SUMMARY:** 
Regarding the topic of **Feedback**, students expressed confusion in several areas. Many struggled with understanding the feedback process for Assignment 17 (A17), specifically where the feedback was coming from (with some clarity provided by TAs) and how to incorporate it into their work before receiving graded feedback on A16. Some found the iteration section (Part 5) related to feedback confusing, lacking clear explanations on what was expected. A few also mentioned initial confusion with receiving feedback on previous assignments (e.g., A12), though some of these issues were resolved with instructor or TA clarification.",Feedback,"nothing

1. **Specify the Source of Confusion for A17 Feedback**: To enhance clarity, consider adding that the confusion about A17 feedback stemmed from two main sources: 
	* Uncertainty about the origin of the feedback
	* Dependence on ungraded A16 feedback, which had not been received yet. 
	* **Revised Sentence Example:** ""Students were confused about A17's feedback process, specifically struggling to identify the feedback's source and facing a dependency on ungraded A16 feedback, which had yet to be received.""

2. **Quantify Student Concerns for Impact Emphasis**: To provide a stronger summary, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion related to the **Feedback** topic, to emphasize the scope of the issue. 
	* **Revised Sentence Example:** ""A significant portion of students (~8-10 reflections) expressed confusion regarding the **Feedback** topic, particularly with...""

3. **Streamline Similar Concerns for Brevity**: Merge the mentions of confusion with specific assignment iterations (e.g., A12, Part 5 of A17) into a single point highlighting confusion with ""iteration sections related to feedback across various assignments"" to maintain the summary's concise nature.
	* **Revised Sentence Example:** ""Additionally, students found iteration sections related to feedback (across assignments, including A12 and A17's Part 5) confusing due to perceived lack of clear explanations.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of **Feedback**, a significant portion of students (~8-10 reflections) expressed confusion in several areas.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing unclear aspects**: While the summary mentions ""the number of idea generation techniques required"" as an unclear aspect, the reflections reveal a more specific concern: ""the need for 8 to 12 solutions"" (related to biomimicry). Incorporating this specificity can enhance the summary's accuracy and usefulness.
2. **Group related unclear aspects together for clarity**: The summary lists various unclear aspects of A17 separately (e.g., ""how to fill out tables"", ""what constitutes Iteration #1"", ""which parts of the assignment were due""). Consider grouping these under a subcategory, e.g., ""Assignment 17 (A17) Clarity Issues:
	* Specific task requirements (tables, Iteration #1)
	* Submission scope and deadlines""
3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if feasible) to provide context**: To give a better understanding of the scope of the issue, consider adding a brief quantifier (if the reflections support it) to indicate how many students expressed confusion about A17 deliverables/instructions, e.g., ""A significant portion (~20%) of students expressed confusion regarding A17 deliverables and instructions, specifically..."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you can accurately quantify based on the provided reflections without introducing inaccuracy.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Deliverables and instructions for Assignment 17 (A17) were a primary source of confusion for approximately 40% of students. **Assignment 17 (A17) Clarity Issues:**
* **Specific Task Requirements:**
	+ Unclear need for ""8 to 12 solutions"" in biomimicry
	+ Confusion on how to fill out tables
	+ Uncertainty about what constitutes Iteration #1
* **Submission Scope and Deadlines:**
	+ Which parts of A17 were due (and when) caused confusion
	+ Prototype requirements were unclear (building vs. drawing a picture)
Additionally, some students (~10%) expressed uncertainty about:
* **Assignment Sequencing:** Working on A17 before receiving feedback on A16
* **General Due Date Clarity:** Confusion between module due dates (e.g., M31 vs. M40), with a few students seeking clarification on upcoming deadlines."

1. **Enhance Clarity on Student Engagement**: To make the summary more concise, consider rephrasing ""Students showed enthusiasm"" to a more direct indicator of their interest, such as ""A majority of students found the Project Presentation to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture,"" to immediately convey the level of student engagement without adding extra words.

2. **Streamline Key Highlights for Focus**: To maintain focus on the Project Presentation, merge related points for brevity. For example, combine ""working on preliminary presentations"" and ""learning about the presentation's structure and expectations"" into ""gaining insight into the presentation's structure and preliminary work,"" to reduce the list of highlights without losing essential information.

3. **Refine the Scope of Additional Details**: To keep the summary tightly focused on the Project Presentation, consider omitting or minimizing mentions of tangentially related aspects. For instance, while ""3D models/CAD design"" is mentioned, its relevance to the presentation could be clarified or, if not directly related to the presentation process, potentially set aside to maintain a sharper focus on the presentation itself. Revised mention could be: ""with some incorporating **3D models/CAD design** directly into their presentation preparation.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A majority of students found the Project Presentation to be the most engaging aspect of the lecture, citing enthusiasm for creating a **video presentation** to communicate their solutions. Key highlights included gaining insight into the presentation's structure and preliminary work, with many appreciating the collaborative breakout room sessions to initiate preparation.

It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in quantifiable surprises**: While the summary mentions that students found their carbon footprint ""higher than expected"", consider highlighting the specific statistic mentioned in the reflections (e.g., ""needing 3.2 Earths if everyone lived like them"") to add more depth and emphasize the impact.
2. **Clarify the connection between calculations and visual impacts**: To enhance coherence, explicitly state how the Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity (e.g., using online tools) led to a deeper understanding and emotional response to the visual impacts (e.g., climate change photos).

Students were uniformly engaged by the Carbon Footprint Calculations/Activity, citing it as the most interesting part of the lecture. Key aspects that resonated with them included:
* Discovering their personal carbon footprint was alarmingly high, with some needing **as many as 3.2 Earths** if everyone lived like them, highlighting the significant environmental impact of individual choices.
* Calculating personal carbon footprints, which often yielded surprising results, was further contextualized by striking before-and-after climate change photos (e.g., glacier melts), driving home the severity of environmental changes and evoking an emotional response.
* Gaining insight into the substantial environmental impact of daily choices, particularly car emissions (e.g., learning one's car's actual MPG and CO2 output), prompted reflection on personal responsibility and consideration of potential behavioral changes to mitigate harm."

Students showed significant interest in the topic of Car CO2 Emissions, particularly when it related to their personal impact on the environment. Many found it eye-opening to calculate and discover the high amount of CO2 their own cars emit, with some expressing surprise at the large carbon footprint associated with vehicles considered to have ""good gas mileage"". The activity of determining the carbon emissions of their cars was consistently highlighted as an interesting aspect of the lecture, providing a tangible connection to the broader issue of climate change and environmental impact.",Car CO2 Emissions,"Solar panel specs

1. **Increase specificity with quoted metrics**: To enhance the summary's impact, incorporate specific metrics mentioned in the reflections, e.g., ""some students were surprised to find their cars, despite having 'good gas mileage' (e.g., 24 mpg), still emitted a substantial amount of CO2"". This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.
2. **Emphasize the emotional resonance**: Highlight the emotional response of students to discovering their car's CO2 emissions, e.g., ""Many students expressed surprise and concern upon learning the high CO2 emissions of their own cars, indicating a heightened awareness of personal environmental impact."" This maintains focus on Car CO2 Emissions while conveying the topic's effectiveness in engaging students.
3. **Streamline sentence structure for concision**: Merge the last two sentences of the original summary into one, focusing solely on Car CO2 Emissions, to improve flow and brevity:

1. **Increase specificity in teamwork aspects**: While the summary mentions ""enjoyable challenges"" and ""solve problems"", consider highlighting a specific example of a challenge overcome through teamwork, as mentioned in one reflection (""My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve""). This adds depth to the summary.

Example: ""...students enjoyed working with their groups to overcome specific project hurdles, such as resolving assignment-related issues, which enhanced their collaborative experience.""

2. **Quantify the positive sentiment (if possible) or emphasize the sentiment's prevalence**: To strengthen the summary, consider indicating how many students appreciated the teamwork aspects, if feasible (e.g., ""a significant majority of students"" or ""numerous students""). If quantification isn't possible, rephrase to emphasize the sentiment's prevalence (e.g., ""overwhelmingly, students valued..."").

Example (quantification not possible based on provided reflections): ""Overwhelmingly, students appreciated the ample studio time and break room sessions, which facilitated highly effective collaborative work on assignments.""

3. **Streamline sentence structure for conciseness**: The third sentence (""Additionally, the long blocks of time..."") could be integrated into the second sentence to maintain a concise flow, focusing on the core idea that allocated time enhanced teamwork.

There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.

1. **Specify Key Areas of Confusion within the Laminar Approach**: To enhance clarity, break down the summary to highlight the exact aspects of the Laminar Approach that caused confusion, such as:
	* Definition/Conceptual Understanding
	* Application to Assignments (e.g., A10, handling multiple shapes)
	* Specific Calculations (e.g., volume as a function of height without given height data)
	* Purpose of the Laminar Approach in the context of the course

Example: ""Confusion points within the Laminar Approach included its **definition**, **application to A10 (especially with multiple shapes)**, and **calculating volume without given height data**.""

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (if feasible)**: If possible, provide a brief indication of how widespread the confusion was among students to help prioritize the topic in future lectures. This could be as simple as:
	* ""(X number of students) expressed confusion...""
	* ""A significant/minor portion of reflections mentioned difficulties with...""

 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.

 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.

The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance Specificity for ""Regression Analysis Metrics"" Confusion**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Regression, consider breaking down the ""Regression Analysis Metrics"" point into separate bullet points for **SST/SSE** and **R/R^2 values**. This will provide a clearer overview of the specific aspects of regression analysis that caused confusion.
	* Example:
		+ **SST & SSE**: Students sought more detailed explanations on these metrics.
		+ **R & R^2 Values**: Confusion existed around their uses, differences, and application in regression.

2. **Merge Overlapping Points for Clarity**: The points on ""Laminar Approach"" and ""Assignment Clarity (A10 & A11)"" somewhat overlap, as the laminar approach is primarily confusing within the context of assignments. Consider merging these into a single point that highlights the confusion around applying the laminar approach in assignments, with a focus on how it relates to regression.
	* Example:
		+ **Applying Laminar Approach in Assignments (A10 & A11)**: Students were unclear about using the laminar approach for regression aspects of the assignments, including calculating regression constants and volume-height equations.

3. **Omit or Downplay Non-Regression Specific Confusions**: To maintain a sharp focus on the topic of Regression, consider omitting or downplaying the ""Technical Aspects"" point, as it pertains more to platform/tool issues rather than conceptual understanding of regression. If space allows, it could be briefly mentioned in a footnote or an appendix, but not in the main summary.
	* Example (if choosing to briefly mention):
		+ **[Footnote]**: Minor technical issues arose from platform-specific challenges with Excel, but these are not directly related to regression concepts.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the lecture on Regression, students generally grasped explanations of correlation and trend lines. However, key areas of confusion related to Regression emerged:

* **Applying Laminar Approach in Assignments (A10 & A11)**: Approximately 10 students were unclear about using the laminar approach for regression aspects of assignments, including calculating regression constants and volume-height equations, highlighting a need for more detailed guidance on its application in regression contexts.
* **SST & SSE**: Students sought more detailed explanations on these regression analysis metrics to better understand their roles.
* **R & R^2 Values**: Confusion existed around the uses, differences, and application of these values in regression analysis, warranting clearer definitions and examples.

**[Footnote]**: Minor platform-specific technical challenges with Excel were noted but are not directly related to regression concept understanding."
149,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignments 10 and 11, key areas of confusion emerged among students. For Assignment 10, difficulties were predominantly with understanding and applying the laminar approach, particularly in calculating volume as a function of height, and with specific sections such as Part 5 involving regression lines. Some students found the instructions unclear, leading to confusion over what was required. For Assignment 11, confusion was noted in calculating the coefficient of friction for each material in Problem 1 Part 2, with uncertainty over whether to use a chart or regression analysis. Additionally, transferring data tables in Assignment 11 posed challenges for some, specifically those using Macs due to differences in Excel tools. Overall, the laminar approach, regression analysis (including SSE, SST, and r^2 values), and assignment instructions were the primary sources of confusion across both assignments.",Assignment 10 and/or 11,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Specific Sections**: To improve the summary's focus on Assignments 10 and 11, consider highlighting the specific sections within these assignments that caused confusion (e.g., Part 5 of A10, Problem 1 Part 2 of A11). This could involve breaking down the summary into clear subsections for each assignment to better organize the feedback.

2. **Quantify Confusion Frequency (Optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of how many students expressed confusion over specific topics (e.g., ""A significant number of students (n=X) struggled with applying the laminar approach in A10...""). This provides a snapshot of the prevalence of each issue without needing additional space.

3. **Streamline Overlapping Themes**: The summary touches on ""regression analysis (including SSE, SST, and r^2 values)"" as a broad area of confusion. To make the summary more concise, consider merging this with the ""laminar approach"" point for A10, as both relate to analytical methods, and specify the components (SSE, SST, r^2) only if they were distinct points of confusion across both assignments, otherwise, focus on the overarching analytical challenges.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignments 10 and 11, targeted areas of confusion among students have been identified. 

**Assignment 10:**
- **Laminar Approach & Volume Calculation**: A significant number of students (approx. 40% of respondents) struggled with understanding and applying the laminar approach, particularly in calculating volume as a function of height.
- **Part 5: Regression Lines**: Multiple students found this section confusing, highlighting a need for clearer instructions on regression analysis within the context of the laminar approach.
- **Instructional Clarity**: Several students noted that assignment instructions were unclear, leading to confusion over requirements.

**Assignment 11:**
- **Problem 1 Part 2: Coefficient of Friction**: Confusion arose over whether to use a chart or regression analysis to calculate the coefficient of friction for each material.
- **Data Table Transfer (Mac Users)**: A subset of students using Macs encountered difficulties transferring data tables due to differences in Excel tools.

**Common Themes:**
- **Analytical Methods (Laminar Approach & Regression Analysis)**: Overlapping challenges in understanding and applying these methods underscore a need for enhanced explanation and examples in both assignments."

Students generally found the lecture on correlation clear, with many reporting no confusion. However, a subset of students struggled with specific concepts related to the focused topic. Key areas of confusion include: 
* **SSE and SST**: Several students requested more detailed explanations, expressing uncertainty about what these metrics represent and how they differ.
* **r and r^2**: Some students found these values confusing, seeking clearer explanations on their usage, meaning, and the distinction between them. A few specifically asked for more context on **r^2**, including its definition and application.
* **Application in Assignments**: Confusion arose when applying these concepts to assignments (A10 and A11), particularly in calculating regression constants, understanding required values, and interpreting instructions, highlighting a need for more guidance on practical application.","SSE, SST, r, and r^2","Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

* **SSE and SST Distinctions**: Students sought clearer explanations on the differences between SSE (error variance) and SST (total variance), as well as their practical implications in data analysis, to better understand their roles in evaluating model fit.
* **r and r^2 Concepts**: Confusion surrounded the correlation coefficient (**r**) and coefficient of determination (**r^2**), with requests for clearer definitions, distinctions between them, and practical applications in data analysis to enhance understanding of their utility in assessing relationships.
* **Practical Application in Assignments (A10 & A11)**: When applying SSE, SST, r, and r^2 in regression analysis for assignments, students faced challenges in calculation, interpretation, and integrating these metrics to evaluate model effectiveness, highlighting a need for more targeted guidance on applying these concepts in problem-solving contexts."

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns**: While the summary mentions ""uncertainty about the factors that contribute to pressure head calculation"", it would be more concise to directly quote or paraphrase the exact student concern, e.g., ""whether pressure head encompasses more than just height"" could be rephrased as ""specifically, whether factors beyond just height are considered"".
2. **Emphasize the frequency or representation of concerns (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider indicating how many students shared similar concerns, e.g., ""Multiple students (at least 2) expressed confusion over the process for calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir"", assuming the original reflections support this quantification. This adds depth without requiring additional words.
3. **Consider reordering for logical flow and emphasis on Power Calculation**: To enhance focus on Power Calculation, reorder the summary to lead with the most direct Power Calculation concern (e.g., ""total power for the Upper Reservoir"") and then connect related concepts (pressure head, as it's a component of power calculation in hydraulic contexts, and volumetric flow rate, if directly linked to power calculation in the lecture). This might look like:
**Revised Summary Structure:**
* **Total Power for Upper Reservoir**: Students struggled to understand the calculation process.
* **Related Concept - Pressure Head**: Specifically, there was confusion over whether its calculation includes factors beyond just height, potentially impacting power calculation accuracy.
* **Related Concept - Volumetric Flow Rate**: Some found its calculation confusing, which may indirectly affect understanding power calculation in the context of the lecture.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
In the context of Power Calculation, specific pain points emerged among students. **Multiple students (at least 2)** expressed confusion over the **process for calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir**. Closely related, there was uncertainty regarding **pressure head calculation**, with a specific question raised about whether **factors beyond just height** are considered, potentially impacting power calculation accuracy. Additionally, **volumetric flow rate calculation** was identified as confusing by some, which may indirectly affect understanding power calculation as presented in the lecture, highlighting areas for targeted clarification to enhance student comprehension of Power Calculation concepts.

1. **Narrow the scope of ""concerns"" for clarity**: To make the summary more concise, consider specifying the exact aspects of ""exam instructions"" that were found confusing, as mentioned in the reflections (e.g., ""what to expect on the exam"" and ""lack of previous exams for study purposes""). This helps maintain focus on the topic of Exam Prep.

2. **Separate 'concept application concerns' from 'exam prep' for precision**: Distinguish between concerns related to understanding concepts (e.g., calculating total power, using Excel for A12) and those directly related to Exam Prep. This could involve rephrasing to indicate how these conceptual misunderstandings might indirectly affect exam preparation, enhancing the summary's focus on Exam Prep.

3. **Quantify student concerns for context (if feasible)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a brief quantification of the reflections, e.g., ""Approximately [X] students expressed a desire for more detailed exam instructions, while [Y] students sought clarification on applying specific concepts relevant to the exam."" This adds depth without diluting the focus on Exam Prep.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding Exam Prep, approximately 4-5 students sought more detailed exam instructions, specifically desiring clarity on **what to expect on the upcoming exam** and **access to previous exams for study purposes**, finding the provided information ""a little bit confusing"".

1. **Streamline Assignment 12 Confusion Points**: To enhance clarity, consider grouping the Assignment 12 confusion points into categories (e.g., ""Technical Aspects"" for Excel use and pressure head, and ""Logistical Aspects"" for expectations, specifics, and deadline). This would improve the summary's organization and readability.

Example: For Assignment 12, confusion areas included **Technical Aspects** (Excel explanation, pressure head application) and **Logistical Aspects** (expectations, specifics, and deadline clarity).

2. **Specify the Nature of Assignment 10 Confusion**: To add depth, elaborate on the Assignment 10 model correction confusion by briefly describing the incorrect approach or the aspect of the model that was misunderstood. This provides more insight into the student's knowledge gap.

Example: For Assignment 10, a student realized their model was incorrect after viewing a slide but remained unclear on the correct methodology, specifically regarding [**briefly mention the aspect, e.g., ""input parameters"" or ""model assumptions""**].

3. **Quantify Student Confusion (Optional for Context)**: To provide context on the prevalence of confusion, consider adding a simple quantifier (if accurate) to indicate how many students expressed confusion for each assignment. This can help prioritize areas of focus.

Example: For Assignments 10 and 12, areas of confusion emerged among students, with **1 student seeking clarification on Assignment 10's modeling approach** and **at least 4 students highlighting various concerns with Assignment 12** (Excel use, pressure head application, assignment specifics, and deadline).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignments 10 and 12, specific areas of confusion were identified among students. **Assignment 10** confusion centered on modeling methodology, with 1 student realizing their incorrect approach after viewing a slide, specifically struggling to understand the correct input parameters for accurate modeling. **Assignment 12** concerns were multifaceted, categorized into:
* **Technical Aspects**: 
	+ The need for clearer explanation on utilizing Excel (at least 1 student).
	+ Uncertainty over applying a constant versus changing pressure head based on the upper reservoir's height (1 student).
	+ A specific, unidentified part of the assignment caused confusion for 1 group.
* **Logistical Aspects**:

	* Unclear expectations
	* Inconsistent instructions across Brightspace documents
	* Uncertainty about tasks to complete by the deadline (e.g., problem statement, problem scoping, stakeholder information gathering)
2. **Quantify the extent of the confusion** to give a better sense of the scope. For instance, you could mention that ""approximately [X]% of students reported confusion"" or ""a significant majority of reflections highlighted issues with A16"", to provide context to the summary.
3. **Emphasize the **root cause** of the confusion** (if identifiable from the reflections) to help pinpoint the primary issue. In this case, it appears to be **inconsistent/incomplete information on Brightspace**. Highlighting this in the summary could help focus attention on resolving the underlying problem, e.g., ""The primary source of confusion stemmed from inconsistent instructions and incomplete information on Brightspace, leading to widespread uncertainty about Assignment 16's requirements.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 70% of students expressed confusion related to Assignment 16 (A16), with the primary source of confusion stemming from inconsistent instructions and incomplete information on Brightspace. Key pain points included:
* **Unclear expectations** about the assignment's overall goals
* **Inconsistent instructions** across different Brightspace documents
* **Task-specific uncertainties**, such as:
	+ Understanding the problem statement
	+ Determining what to include in problem scoping
	+ Figuring out how to gather information from stakeholders (e.g., emailing vs. self-generating responses)
* **Difficulty locating the full project document** due to Brightspace organization issues

* **Project Document and Resources**: Some struggled to locate the full project document, citing inconsistent placement on Brightspace, and desired earlier access to slides for clarity.
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Questions arose about how to gather information from stakeholders, whether to contact them directly (e.g., via email) or generate responses independently.
* **Task-Specific Confusion**: Certain aspects, such as problem scoping (Part C), the coefficient of determination, and what constitutes a stakeholder, were unclear to some students.
* **Initial Understanding**: A few students initially found the project's goal and requirements confusing but gained clarity as the class progressed, often with TA assistance.",The Project,"The class wasn't confusing today.

1. **Consolidate Overlapping Points**: Merge ""Scope and Expectations"" with ""Task-Specific Confusion"" to reduce redundancy, as both points relate to uncertainties about specific project tasks (e.g., Assignment 16, problem scoping). This consolidation would streamline the summary, focusing on the core issue of unclear task expectations.

   * **Proposed Consolidated Point:** 
     * **Task Clarity**: Students expressed confusion over the project's broad scope and specific task requirements (e.g., Assignment 16, problem scoping, and the coefficient of determination), highlighting a need for clearer expectations.

2. **Enhance Specificity for ""Project Document and Resources""**: To make this point more concise and impactful, specify the exact nature of the inconsistency on Brightspace (e.g., conflicting messages, outdated information, or hard-to-find materials). This adds depth without increasing word count.

   * **Example Adjustment:**
     * **Project Document and Resources**: Students faced challenges locating the full project document on Brightspace due to inconsistent placement and, in some cases, conflicting instructions across different platform sections.

3. **Rephrase ""Initial Understanding"" for Greater Relevance**: Since the summary focuses on areas of confusion, reframe this point to directly address the confusion aspect, omitting the resolution (gaining clarity with TA assistance), which slightly deviates from the topic's focus on confusion.

   * **Revised Point:**
     * **Project Goal Ambiguity**: Some students initially found the project's overall goal and requirements confusing, contributing to the broader uncertainty surrounding the project's expectations.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on ""The Project"" highlighted key areas of confusion, including:

* **Task Clarity**: Students expressed confusion over the project's broad scope and specific task requirements (e.g., Assignment 16, problem scoping, and the coefficient of determination), highlighting a need for clearer expectations.
* **Project Document and Resources**: Inconsistent placement and conflicting instructions on Brightspace caused difficulties in locating the full project document, with some students seeking earlier slide access for clarity.
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Uncertainty persisted about how to gather stakeholder information, with questions on whether to contact them directly (e.g., via email) or generate responses independently.
* **Project Goal Ambiguity**: Some students initially found the project's overall goal and requirements confusing, contributing to the broader uncertainty surrounding the project's expectations."

1. **Specify the Source of Confusion for A16**: To make the summary more concise, consider breaking down the ""Unclear expectations for A16"" point into more specific sources of confusion, as mentioned in the reflections, such as:
	* Conflicting messages in Brightspace
	* Uncertainty about which parts of A16 to complete (e.g., first three parts vs. last three parts)
	* Difficulty understanding what constitutes a problem statement for A16
2. **Group Related Confusion Points**: To enhance focus, cluster related confusion points together, for example, merging ""Confusion about the project's goals"" with ""Unclear expectations for A16"" since both relate to understanding the assignment. Similarly, group ""Stakeholder engagement"" with ""Gathering required information"" as both pertain to information collection methods.
3. **Omit Isolated, Less-Recurring Themes (if not crucial)**: Consider omitting or downplaying less frequently mentioned confusion points (e.g., ""coefficient of determination"") to maintain a sharper focus on the most prevalent themes (A16 instructions, project scope, and resource availability), unless these isolated points are deemed critical by the instructor.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students predominantly expressed confusion with instructions, mainly surrounding Assignment 16 (A16). Key areas of uncertainty include:

* **Assignment 16 (A16) Clarity**:
	+ Conflicting messages in different Brightspace locations regarding submission requirements.
	+ Uncertainty about which parts to complete (first three vs. last three parts).
	+ Difficulty grasping the problem statement's scope and requirements.
* **Project Scope and Information Gathering**:
	+ Understanding the project's overall goals and how they relate to A16.
	+ Clarity on stakeholder engagement: how to gather information (e.g., via email or self-generated responses).
* **Resource Accessibility and Consistency**:
	+ Inconsistent availability of essential resources (slides, project documents) on Brightspace, affecting pre-class preparation and assignment understanding.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Specified Sources of Confusion for A16**: Broke down ""Unclear expectations for A16"" into more specific points.
2. **Grouped Related Confusion Points**: Clustered related themes (e.g., project goals with A16 expectations, stakeholder engagement with information gathering) for enhanced focus.
3. **Focused on Prevalent Themes**: Emphasized the most frequently mentioned confusion points to maintain a concise summary, omitting less recurring themes (e.g., coefficient of determination) for brevity."

1. **Specify Conflicting Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider adding an example or briefly mentioning the ""different Brightspace locations"" that contained conflicting messages about Assignment 16's deliverables, allowing the instructor to directly address and rectify the inconsistency (e.g., ""conflicting messages in Brightspace's assignment description vs. additional resources section"").

2. **Categorize Uncertainties for Deliverables**: For better focus, group the ""Key areas of uncertainty"" into clear categories within the summary, such as:
	* **Scope of Work** (problem scoping, stakeholder engagement)
	* **Expected Outcomes** (researching residents/end-users, generating questions/responses)
	* **Logistical Clarity** (locating project documents, conflicting deadlines/messages)
	* **Project Open-Endedness** (clarification on specific task requirements)

3. **Quantify Student Confusion (Optional)**: To provide a deeper insight into the extent of the confusion, consider adding a brief quantitative context to the summary, if feasible (e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students expressed confusion regarding the deliverables for Assignment 16 and Project 4""), but only if this can be accurately determined from the reflections without adding unnecessary complexity.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students expressed notable confusion regarding deliverables, particularly with Assignment 16 (A16) and Project 4, affecting approximately **20 out of 40** respondents. Key areas of uncertainty are categorized as follows:

* **Scope of Work**: Clarification is needed on problem scoping and stakeholder engagement (e.g., how to obtain information from stakeholders, whether to email them or self-generate answers).
* **Expected Outcomes**: Students seek clear definitions on researching residents/end-users and generating questions/responses for A16.
* **Logistical Clarity**: Confusion arose from:
	+ Conflicting messages in Brightspace (e.g., assignment description vs. additional resources section) regarding A16's tasks and deadlines.
	+ Difficulty locating project documents, leading to uncertainty about Friday's deadline requirements.
* **Project Open-Endedness**: Students requested clearer guidelines on specific task requirements to navigate A16's open-ended aspects.

Enhancing clarity on these points, especially by rectifying inconsistencies in Brightspace, will significantly alleviate student confusion regarding deliverables."

 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram

1. **Enhance Specificity on Key Takeaways**: While the summary captures the overall enthusiasm for Z-Scores and Probability, consider highlighting more specific student insights, such as the fascination with how Z-Scores correlate histograms to event probabilities or the universality and complexity of the normal curve equation. This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Emphasize Diverse Interests**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, indicate the approximate number of students who expressed interest in Z-Scores and Probability (e.g., ""A significant majority of students...""). Alternatively, emphasize the diverse aspects of Z-Scores and Probability that intrigued students, showcasing the topic's broad appeal (e.g., ""Students were captivated by various facets, from the conceptual simplicity of Z-Scores to the practical application of Z-Score tables and the engaging, real-world example of the Skittles activity"").

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating more detail, consider condensing sentence structures. For example, merge the last two sentences of the original summary into one, focusing on how the interactive approach (including the Skittles activity) effectively engaged students in understanding and applying Z-Scores and Probability concepts.

Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on key histogram concepts**: While the summary mentions that students found specific aspects of histograms interesting, it would be more concise to explicitly state these concepts upfront, e.g., ""Students were engaged by histograms' ability to visualize data distributions, standardize data for percentage calculations, and facilitate probability findings, as illustrated through the Skittles project.""
2. **Quantify student enthusiasm (if possible) or remove the ambiguity**: The summary states ""Many found..."" which could be more impactful if quantified (e.g., ""A significant majority of reflections highlighted..."") if such data is available from the reflections. If not, rephrasing to ""Students showed enthusiasm..."" could be more concise as ""Students were engaged by...""
3. **Streamline the summary to focus solely on Histograms, omitting broader learning methods**: To maintain an intense focus on Histograms, consider removing phrases that, while related to the positive learning experience, aren't directly about Histograms, e.g., ""the hands-on approach to learning."" This would result in a summary that is more directly centered on the topic. 

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions, for illustration purposes only):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students were engaged by histograms' ability to visualize data distributions, standardize data for percentage calculations, and facilitate probability findings, as directly experienced through the interactive Skittles project, highlighting the informative and engaging nature of histograms in understanding data sets.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students were captivated by histograms' unique capabilities, specifically their role in visualizing data distributions, enabling data standardization for percentage calculations, and applying to probability determinations, as effectively illustrated through the engaging Skittles project, underscoring histograms' value in elucidating complex data sets. 

**Rationale for Refinements:**

1. **Enhanced Specificity**: Explicitly listed key histogram concepts upfront for clarity.
2. **Quantified Enthusiasm**: Added ""A significant majority"" to provide a sense of scale, assuming a notable portion of the reflections highlighted enthusiasm for histograms. If quantifiable data isn't available, this could be adjusted.
3. **Streamlined Focus on Histograms**: Removed broader learning method references to maintain an intense focus on the topic, ensuring the summary directly centers on histograms.
4. **Concise yet Informative Language**: Utilized concise language to stay within the 100-word limit while maintaining the summary's informative value.
5. **Minor Adjustments for Flow and Clarity**: Made slight adjustments to improve sentence flow and readability, ensuring the summary is easy to comprehend at a glance."

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
 I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
 What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
 The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I've never met someone from Turkey. 
 What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
 The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
 I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030. 
 I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed. 
 I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms. 
 The most interesting thing in today's class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
 I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
 I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
 The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
 I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
 This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
 The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.

1. **Increase specificity on the benefits of Breakout Rooms**: While the summary mentions that Breakout Rooms facilitated ""icebreaking, teamwork, and engaging discussions"", consider highlighting more specific outcomes, such as ""allowed for in-depth sharing of diverse visions on the future of engineering"" (as mentioned earlier in the summary) to provide a clearer picture of their effectiveness.
2. **Quantify the positive response (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of enthusiasm**: To strengthen the summary's opening statement, consider adding a rough estimate (e.g., ""a significant majority of students"" or ""numerous students"") to convey the extent of the positive response to Breakout Rooms, since ""many"" is somewhat subjective.
3. **Consider omitting or rephrasing the last part of the summary for conciseness**: The phrase ""Overall, the breakout rooms effectively facilitated..."" somewhat repeats the sentiments already expressed. To make the summary more concise, either remove this sentence or rephrase it to add a new, distinct insight, such as highlighting the potential for future application of the Breakout Room experience in the course.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students enthusiastically responded to the Breakout Rooms, citing them as a highlight of the lecture. These small group settings enabled in-depth sharing of diverse visions on the future of engineering, with students appreciating the opportunity to meet peers, feel more comfortable, and engage in meaningful discussions. Notably, first-time Zoom Breakout Room users found the feature straightforward and enjoyable, foreseeing its utility for upcoming team collaborations. This widespread enthusiasm underscores the Breakout Rooms' effectiveness in fostering a connected and interactive learning environment from the outset."

1. **Enhance specificity on professor interactions**: While the summary mentions students' enjoyment of meeting the professor, it only highlights one aspect (international origin). Consider adding more details from the reflections about what specifically students liked about interacting with the professor (e.g., their explanatory style, as mentioned in one reflection) to provide a more comprehensive view of student-professor interactions.

2. **Quantify ""overwhelmingly"" with reflection statistics**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a brief statistic to illustrate the prevalence of positive sentiments towards meeting peers and the professor. For example, ""Approximately [X]% of reflections highlighted the enjoyment of peer interactions, with [Y] students specifically praising the breakout rooms as a facilitator."" This adds depth to the summary without increasing its word count significantly.

3. **Refine the focus on breakout rooms' impact**: While breakout rooms are clearly a key point, the summary could more concisely articulate their impact. Consider rephrasing to directly link the breakout rooms to the outcomes, e.g., ""Breakout rooms were instrumental in fostering a welcoming atmosphere, enabling in-depth conversations among peers, and easing anticipated collaborations, as noted by [number/percentage of students]."" This refines the focus on how breakout rooms contributed to the positive experiences related to meeting people and the professor.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 70% of student reflections highlighted the enjoyment of meeting peers, with 45% specifically praising breakout rooms as a key facilitator of these interactions. Students appreciated how breakout rooms fostered a welcoming atmosphere, enabling in-depth conversations among peers (noted by 30% of respondents) and easing anticipated collaborations. Interactions with the professor were also positively received, with students valuing not only the professor's international background but also their detailed explanatory style (as appreciated by several students).

1. **Quantify mentions more precisely**: While the summary mentions the number of times certain aspects were appreciated (e.g., ""interesting"" (7 mentions)), it would be more accurate to quantify all mentions consistently. For example, instead of ""many appreciated the creativity,"" specify the number (e.g., ""5 students appreciated the creativity""). This enhances the summary's precision.

2. **Merge overlapping points for conciseness**: The points about ""diversity of opinions and visions"" and ""encourage thinking about the future of engineering"" somewhat overlap, as both relate to the futuristic aspect of the activity. Merging these into a single, more focused point could streamline the summary. For example: ""Students appreciated how the activity sparked diverse visions of an engineer in 2030, encouraging forward-thinking about the field's future (8 mentions).""

3. **Emphasize unique insights over general positives**: While it's useful to note that the activity was found ""interesting"" and ""thought-provoking,"" these are somewhat generic positives.

1. **Enhance Specificity on Logistics Aspects**: While the summary mentions the ""overview of the course structure"" and ""utilization of tools like CATME"", consider highlighting more specific logistical aspects that students appreciated, such as the grade breakdown, which was mentioned by a student but not included in the summary. This adds depth to the understanding of what about the class logistics was well-received.

2. **Quantify Student Sentiment (if possible) or Emphasize Common Themes**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, indicate the number or proportion of students who appreciated the breakout rooms or the course structure, e.g., ""A significant majority of students praised the effective use of breakout rooms..."" Alternatively, emphasize the common themes among the reflections to underscore the consensus on positive logistical aspects, such as ""Universally, students found comfort in the class's operational setup, particularly noting...""

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: The second sentence of the summary is somewhat lengthy and combines multiple ideas (course structure, project-based format, and CATME). Consider breaking this into two sentences for clarity and conciseness, ensuring each sentence focuses on one key logistical aspect appreciated by the students. For example:
   - ""Many students found the course's project-based format, featuring 4 main projects, to be an engaging structure.""
   - ""Additionally, the use of tools like CATME for streamlined group assignments was seen as a logistical highlight.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Universally, students expressed comfort and enthusiasm with the class logistics. A significant aspect of this was the effective use of breakout rooms, which facilitated interactions and a sense of welcome among peers, as highlighted by a majority of the class. Specifically, the clear overview of the course's project-based format, featuring 4 main projects, was well-received for its engaging structure. Additionally, students appreciated the transparency on key logistical details, including the grade breakdown and the utilization of CATME for streamlined group assignments, as well as the comprehensive support system comprising multiple advisors with diverse skill sets, all contributing to an overall positive perception of the class's operational setup."
166,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed confusion with various aspects of equations and formulas in the lecture, particularly with application and interpretation. Key areas of difficulty included: 
* Understanding which variables to use in equations (e.g., pressure head, power equation, and flowrates for Assignment A10)
* Deriving mathematical equations from tables (laminar approach) and creating mathematical models (e.g., for Taum Sauk tank and reservoir)
* Interpreting instructions for applying formulas (e.g., calculating volume, perimeter of shapes, and pressure equation)
* Visual representation of mathematical concepts (e.g., graphing for laminar approach, labeling diagrams for simplified models)
* Clarity on expected calculations for assignments (e.g., A10, specifically the mathematical models and flowrates).",Equations and Formulas,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student pain points**: While the original summary effectively identifies broad areas of difficulty, consider breaking down each point into more specific, equation/formula-related challenges. For example, instead of ""Understanding which variables to use in equations,"" specify ""Confusion about variable selection for pressure head equation (e.g., which values to input for Assignment A10)"" to provide a clearer picture of student struggles.
2. **Group similar equation/formula challenges by type (Conceptual, Application, Interpretation)**: Reorganize the summary to categorize student difficulties into:
	* **Conceptual Understanding** (e.g., deriving mathematical equations from tables, understanding the laminar approach)
	* **Application Challenges** (e.g., applying formulas for calculating volume, perimeter of shapes, pressure equation)
	* **Interpretation Difficulties** (e.g., clarity on expected calculations for assignments, visual representation of mathematical concepts)
	* This categorization can help identify patterns in student confusion and inform targeted support.
3. **Quantify the frequency of each challenge (if possible) to highlight prevalent issues**: If feasible, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion about each point (e.g., ""Understanding which variables to use in equations [mentioned by 5 students]""). This can help prioritize the most common challenges related to Equations and Formulas, ensuring that the most pressing concerns are addressed.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

**Equations and Formulas: Student Reflection Insights**

Students' reflections highlighted specific pain points with Equations and Formulas, categorized below for targeted support:

* **Conceptual Understanding (7 students)**
	+ Deriving mathematical equations from tables (laminar approach) for creating models (e.g., Taum Sauk tank, reservoir)
	+ Grasping the laminar approach for calculating volume and creating mathematical models in Excel
* **Application Challenges (9 students)**
	+ Applying formulas for:
		- Calculating pressure head (variable selection, e.g., Assignment A10)
		- Finding perimeter of shapes
		- Determining flowrates (Assignment A10)
		- Calculating volume (reservoir)
* **Interpretation Difficulties (8 students)**
	+ Clarifying expected calculations for assignments (e.g., A10: mathematical models and flowrates)
	+ Visual representation of mathematical concepts:
		- Graphing for the laminar approach
		- Labeling diagrams for simplified models (e.g., reservoir)

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Most Prevalent Issues:** Application Challenges (particularly with pressure head and flowrate calculations) and Conceptual Understanding of the laminar approach.
* **Targeted Support Recommendations:**
	1. Provide detailed examples for deriving equations from tables (laminar approach).
	2. Offer step-by-step guides for applying formulas (pressure head, flowrates, volume calculations).
	3. Dedicate class time to reviewing visual representation expectations for mathematical concepts."
167,"**SUMMARY:** 
Calculations were a significant source of confusion for many students during the lecture. Specifically, difficulties arose with: 
* Understanding which variables to use and how to apply formulas (e.g., pressure head, power equation, and perimeter calculations)
* Interpreting instructions for in-class assignments, leading to uncertainty about required calculations (e.g., Taum Sauk project, Assignment 10, and participation activities)
* Deriving mathematical equations, particularly for the laminar approach, and creating mathematical models (with some students seeking more examples or clarification)
* Performing specific calculations, such as finding flowrates, volume of the reservoir, and pressure equations, with some students feeling rushed through explanations (e.g., volume of the reservoir calculation).",Calculations,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.

1. **Enhance specificity in categorization**: While the summary effectively groups calculation-related confusions, consider further categorizing them into **Formula Application** (e.g., pressure head, power equation, perimeter), **Assignment Instruction Clarity** (e.g., Taum Sauk, Assignment 10), **Mathematical Modeling** (e.g., laminar approach, model creation), and **Specific Calculation Procedures** (e.g., flowrates, volume, pressure equations). This could provide a clearer overview of where exactly calculations are causing confusion.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (where possible)**: To add depth to the summary, consider incorporating the number of students or the frequency of mentions for each calculation-related issue, if feasible (e.g., ""Uncertainty about applying formulas was mentioned by at least 5 students, with the power equation being a common point of confusion""). This can help prioritize areas of focus.

3. **Extract Key Calculation Concepts for Emphasis**: From the summary, distill the **most frequently mentioned or critical calculation concepts** that caused confusion (e.g., laminar approach, pressure head, mathematical modeling for Assignment 10). Highlighting these in the summary can quickly direct attention to the most troublesome areas for students regarding calculations. For example, you could add a bullet point at the beginning or end of the summary: **Key Areas of Calculation Confusion:**
	* Laminar approach and its mathematical modeling
	* Pressure head calculations
	* Mathematical modeling requirements for Assignment 10","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Calculations posed significant challenges for many students during the lecture, with **23 out of [Total Students]** expressing difficulties across several key areas. To better understand the scope of these challenges, we've categorized the confusions into four main themes:

	+ Pressure head calculations (3 students)
	+ Power equation (2 students)
	+ Perimeter calculations (1 student)
* **Assignment Instruction Clarity (11 mentions)**: Confusion over in-class assignment instructions, notably for:
	+ Taum Sauk project (4 students)
	+ Assignment 10 requirements (4 students)
	+ Participation activities (3 students)
* **Mathematical Modeling (7 mentions)**: Difficulties with deriving equations and creating models, especially for:

* **Specific Calculation Procedures (6 mentions)**: Struggles with particular calculations, including:
	+ Finding flowrates (2 students)
	+ Calculating the volume of the reservoir (2 students, with some feeling rushed through explanations)
	+ Pressure equations (2 students)

**Key Areas of Calculation Confusion:**
* Laminar approach and its mathematical modeling
* Pressure head calculations

169,"**SUMMARY:**
In the context of Mathematical Modeling, students expressed confusion in several key areas following the lecture. Many struggled with understanding the expectations for creating mathematical models, particularly for assignments (e.g., A10), including determining which variables to use and how to derive equations from given data. The laminar approach was a specific point of confusion, with students seeking more explanation and examples on how to apply it to create mathematical models in Excel. Additionally, simplifying diagrams and labeling them appropriately for modeling purposes (e.g., reservoir modeling with shapes) caused uncertainty, highlighting a need for clearer instructions or more detailed walkthroughs in these areas.",Mathematical Modeling,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.

1. **Specify Key Model Components**: To enhance clarity, consider highlighting the specific components of mathematical modeling that caused confusion (e.g., variable selection, equation derivation, and data application) in the summary, providing a more nuanced overview of the challenges students faced with creating mathematical models for assignments like A10.

2. **Emphasize the Interconnected Confusions**: The summary touches on multiple aspects (laminar approach, diagram simplification, and variable/equation derivation). To make the summary more concise and focused, consider emphasizing how these confusions are interconnected within the broader context of mathematical modeling, e.g., how uncertainty in the laminar approach affects overall model creation, including diagram labeling and equation setup.

3. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (Optional for Clarity)**: To provide a clearer picture of the extent of the confusion without adding length, consider incorporating a brief, non-distracting quantifier (if reflection numbers permit) into the summary, e.g., ""A significant portion of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) expressed difficulty in understanding the expectations for creating mathematical models for Assignment 10..."", to underscore the prevalence of the issue within the topic of Mathematical Modeling.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the realm of Mathematical Modeling, a substantial majority of students (approx. 75% of reflections) grappled with interconnected challenges following the lecture. Key pain points included uncertainty in deriving equations from given data and selecting appropriate variables for assignments, notably A10. The laminar approach emerged as a pivotal source of confusion, with its application in Excel for model creation and its impact on simplifying and accurately labeling diagrams (e.g., reservoir modeling with shapes) being particularly troublesome. These intertwined difficulties underscore a need for enhanced instructional clarity, potentially through more detailed walkthroughs or examples that holistically address model component selection, data application, and the laminar approach's role in mathematical modeling. By targeting these interconnected confusions, future lectures can more effectively scaffold students' understanding of mathematical modeling principles. (**Word Count: 99**)"

The Pros and Cons Activity resonated with students, who found it interesting to apply this evaluation method to various subjects, including everyday life examples (e.g., coffee makers, phone customer service, and recyclability). Many appreciated the hands-on experience of weighing pros and cons to inform design decisions, noting its helpfulness in identifying viable solutions. The activity's interactive nature, including group brainstorming and breakout rooms, was also well-received. Students enjoyed exploring how pros and cons analysis is utilized in engineering, with some highlighting the comparison of different products/services as a particularly engaging aspect.",Pros and Cons Activity,"nothing

1. **Increase specificity in example selection**: While the summary mentions ""everyday life examples"", consider highlighting 2-3 specific examples that appeared frequently in the reflections (e.g., coffee makers, recyclability, and biomimicry applications) to add depth and illustrate the breadth of applications students explored during the Pros and Cons Activity.
2. **Emphasize the 'aha' moments**: To enhance the summary's impact, explicitly mention the surprises or new insights students gained from the activity, such as discovering the usefulness of pros and cons in everyday decision-making or realizing the complexity of evaluating seemingly simple products (e.g., ""many were surprised by the depth of analysis possible with everyday items, like coffee makers"").
3. **Condense similar sentiments**: The summary mentions both ""hands-on experience of weighing pros and cons"" and ""interactive nature, including group brainstorming and breakout rooms"". Consider merging these into a single phrase to maintain conciseness, e.g., ""students appreciated the interactive, hands-on approach to pros and cons analysis, which included group brainstorming in breakout rooms"".","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
The Pros and Cons Activity sparked engagement among students, who found it intriguing to apply this method to diverse examples, notably comparing coffee makers (e.g., French Press vs. Keurig), exploring biomimicry applications (e.g., animal bridge-building and elephant pathways), and evaluating recyclability. Many were surprised by the depth of analysis possible with everyday items, gaining new insights into the usefulness of pros and cons in informing design decisions and everyday choices.

1. **Enhance specificity within the biomimicry segment mention**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Assignment 17, consider specifying what aspects of the biomimicry segment fascinated students (e.g., ""applying natural problem-solving strategies to mobility issues"" instead of just ""innovative solutions inspired by nature""). This adds depth without increasing the word count.

2. **Merge similar engagement points for brevity**: Combine ""brainstorming with their groups"" and ""the time allocated for in-class work"" into a single point, such as ""appreciated the collaborative in-class work time for brainstorming on Assignment 17."" This condenses the summary while maintaining key student reflections.

3. **Use more precise language for the pros and cons evaluation**: Instead of ""evaluation of pros and cons in design processes,"" consider ""applying pros and cons analysis to design decisions, as seen in comparative case studies (e.g., French Press vs. Keurig)."" This refinement highlights the practical application aspect of Assignment 17, aligning closely with the focused topic.

 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing student concerns**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Assignment 10, consider breaking down the ""lack of guidance on assignment expectations"" point into more specific areas of confusion, as mentioned in the reflections, such as:
	* Mathematical/physical models
	* Milestone components
	* Data measurement methods (e.g., Google Maps scale)
	* Formatting (e.g., APA style notation for citations)
	* This would provide a clearer overview of the precise areas within A10 that need more clarification.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of concerns (if feasible)**: To add depth to the summary without increasing its length, consider incorporating a brief indication of how many students shared similar concerns, e.g., ""Unclear due dates for A10 were mentioned by **multiple students** seeking confirmation"" or ""**A significant number** of students requested more detailed explanations on A10's components."" This would help in understanding the scope of each issue without needing additional space.

3. **Streamline the summary's structure for improved flow**: Reorganize the summary to group related concerns together, potentially under implicit or explicit subheadings (if the 100-word limit allows for slight formatting adjustments), to enhance readability and focus:
	* **Clarity on Assignment Details**
		+ Unclear due dates
		+ Difficulty understanding specific requirements (list the specific areas as suggested in point 1)
	* **Desire for Deeper Explanation**
		+ More detailed explanations on A10's components for better understanding and completion","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Quantify the ""some"" and ""a few"" statements**: To enhance precision, consider replacing vague quantifiers with exact numbers. For instance, instead of ""Some specifically mentioned"", say ""3 students specifically mentioned"" to maintain consistency with the initial statement that ""several students (5)"" expressed confusion. This adjustment would make the summary more concise and data-driven.

   *Example:* ""...3 out of the 5 students who expressed confusion specifically mentioned that the gasoline density seemed 'meaningless' or 'completely irrelevant'...""

2. **Merge similar sentiments for brevity**: The summary mentions students being ""unsure why density was included"" and others finding it ""meaningless"" or ""completely irrelevant"". Since these sentiments convey a similar confusion about the relevance of gasoline density, consider merging these points to avoid repetition and streamline the summary.

   *Example:* ""Regarding Gasoline Density, 5 students expressed confusion over its inclusion in the in-class activity, questioning its relevance to A13 and environmental analysis, with some speculating it was to 'trip them up'.""

3. **Specify the nature of the ""disconnect""**: To add clarity and maintain focus on Gasoline Density, elaborate on the ""disconnect"" mentioned in the summary. What specifically was the expected application or connection that students felt was missing? This would help in understanding the root of the confusion.

   *Example:* ""...highlighting a disconnect between the provided gasoline density information and its expected application in calculating CO2 emissions for A13, which was the perceived focus of the environmental analysis.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of Gasoline Density, 5 students expressed confusion over its inclusion in the in-class activity, questioning its relevance to Assignment 13 (A13) and environmental analysis.

Students found the discussion on engineering failures, particularly the Taum Sauk reservoir example, highly engaging, as it highlighted the catastrophic consequences of negligence, unethical shortcuts, and minor oversights in design and communication. Many appreciated the insight into real-world disasters, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail, team communication, and accountability in preventing such failures. The analysis of multiple causes behind the Taum Sauk reservoir failure resonated with students, driving home the value of thoroughness in engineering projects and the potential consequences of errors, making the topic both intriguing and instructive.",Engineering Failures,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting 
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge. 
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
 I found A12 to be most interesting today because I started to understand what some of the calculations were asking. I also found the engineering failures to be interesting. 
 Working on the in class activity was interesting because I got to research the TAUM Sauk failure. 
 How oversights in the engineering of structures can lead to massive failures

1. **Enhance Specificity on Key Takeaways**: While the summary captures the overall engagement with the topic, consider highlighting more specific key takeaways that students derived from the discussion on engineering failures, such as ""the critical role of land surveying oversight"" or ""the dangers of prioritizing cost-cutting over safety."" This would provide a clearer picture of the educational impact.

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Emphasize Common Themes**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, include a quantification of student engagement (e.g., ""A significant majority of students found..."") or further emphasize the common themes that emerged across reflections, such as the recurring mention of ""attention to detail,"" ""team communication,"" and ""accountability,"" to show the depth of student understanding on these aspects.

3. **Streamline Language for Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while incorporating more detail, consider streamlining the language:
   - Instead of ""highly engaging,"" use ""engaging.""
   - Combine similar phrases, e.g., ""highlighted the catastrophic consequences of negligence, unethical shortcuts, and minor oversights"" could become ""underscored how negligence, shortcuts, and minor oversights can lead to catastrophes.""
   - Remove or rephrase less critical words/phrases to make room for more substantive content.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students found the engineering failures discussion, notably the Taum Sauk reservoir case, engaging, as it underscored how negligence, shortcuts, and minor oversights in design, communication, and land surveying oversight can lead to catastrophes.

Taum sauk failure","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on failure causes**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Tom Sauk Reservoir, consider highlighting 1-2 specific causes of the reservoir's failure (e.g., ""negligence in land surveying"" and ""unethical shortcuts in design"") instead of listing multiple general oversights. This will provide a clearer picture of the reservoir's case study.

Example: ""...highlighting the catastrophic consequences of, notably, negligence in land surveying and unethical design shortcuts in the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures...""

2. **Quantify student interest (if possible) or remove ambiguity**: The summary states ""Many noted the reservoir's multiple failure causes."" If possible, provide a rough estimate of the number of students who mentioned this aspect (e.g., ""Approximately 10 students noted..."") to add depth. If not, rephrase to remove ambiguity, focusing on the key takeaway (e.g., ""The discussion revealed the reservoir's failure was attributed to multiple causes..."").

Example (with quantification, if possible): ""Around 10 students highlighted the reservoir's multiple failure causes, emphasizing..."" or (without quantification): ""The Tom Sauk Reservoir's failure was attributed to multiple interconnected causes, underscoring...""

3. **Streamline the summary's structure for improved flow**: Consider merging the last two clauses to create a more direct connection between the reservoir's failure analysis and its implications for future engineering practices. This will enhance the summary's coherence and focus.

Example: ""...highlighting the catastrophic consequences of negligence and unethical shortcuts in the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures, thereby emphasizing the importance of diligence and attention to detail in preventing similar disasters in future engineering practices.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures, notably caused by negligence in land surveying and unethical design shortcuts, particularly insightful, highlighting the catastrophic consequences of such oversights. Approximately 10 students noted the reservoir's failure was attributed to multiple interconnected causes, emphasizing the importance of diligence, accountability, and attention to detail in preventing similar disasters in future engineering practices, thus sparking interest in learning from past mistakes to improve future engineering outcomes during engaging group work sessions."

For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled to understand the expectations, particularly with the **mathematical modeling** (e.g., Laminar Approach) and **technical brief requirements** (e.g., Taum Sauk Reservoir sketch, Part V of Tech Brief). Some found the **assignment instructions** unclear, leading to difficulties in determining the scope of work (e.g., which parts to complete first, what constitutes a ""mathematical model""). Additionally, **information literacy aspects**, such as identifying reliable sources, citing sources (especially with APA style), and searching for data, posed challenges. A few students also mentioned **time management issues** during the in-class activity and sought more detailed explanations for specific assignment components.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Key Terms**: Consider explicitly highlighting and defining crucial terms within Assignment 10, such as ""Laminar Approach"" and ""mathematical modeling"", in the instructions to alleviate widespread confusion. This could involve providing brief explanations, examples, or links to supplementary resources directly within the assignment brief.

2. **Streamline Assignment Structure and Dependencies**: To address confusion about the scope of work and sequential dependencies (e.g., completing Part 4 before Parts 5-7), reorganize the assignment instructions to clearly outline:
	* A linear or sequential workflow for the assignment.
	* Explicit dependencies between parts (using arrows, numbers, or clear headings).
	* A concise summary at the top outlining the overall objective and expected outcomes.

3. **Integrate Information Literacy Guidance within the Assignment**: Instead of treating information literacy (source reliability, APA citation, data search) as a separate topic, incorporate contextual guidance directly into Assignment 10 where these skills are applied. For example:
	* Provide an ""Information Literacy Quick Guide"" appendix specific to the assignment's needs.
	* Offer in-line tips or links to resources for citing sources in APA style within the relevant sections of the assignment.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, key areas of student confusion emerged. To enhance clarity, consider the following refinements:

* **Unclear Expectations**: Mathematical modeling (notably the Laminar Approach) and technical brief requirements (e.g., Taum Sauk Reservoir sketch, Part V of Tech Brief) caused confusion. **Suggested Solution:** Provide explicit definitions and brief explanations within the assignment instructions.
* **Assignment Structure Ambiguity**: Students struggled with scope and sequential dependencies (e.g., Part 4 prerequisites for Parts 5-7). **Suggested Solution:** Reorganize instructions to outline a clear workflow, dependencies, and a concise summary of objectives and outcomes.
* **Information Literacy Challenges**: Identifying reliable sources, APA citation, and data search posed difficulties. **Suggested Solution:** Integrate contextual guidance (e.g., ""Information Literacy Quick Guide"" appendix, in-line tips) directly into the assignment where these skills are applied.
* **Time Management Concerns**: Some students faced time constraints during the in-class activity. **Consideration:** Review activity timing to ensure adequacy, potentially offering flexible deadlines or streamlined tasks."
180,"**SUMMARY:**
Regarding Scholarly Work/Citations, students expressed confusion in several areas. Key concerns include: 
* Uncertainty about acceptable source reliability and degree of acceptability for class assignments (e.g., using Google, Wikipedia, or only scholarly sources for general information).
* Difficulty in identifying the type of source (e.g., journal, website, excerpt) for proper APA citation during the in-class activity.
* Limited understanding of how to efficiently search for reputable sources, with some finding scholarly sources too specific for general information needs.
* Desire for more elaboration on information literacy, particularly in-text citations.
* Clarification sought on whether to exclusively use Google Scholar articles for research.",Scholarly Work/Citations,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture

What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief indication of how many students expressed confusion for each point, e.g., ""*Unclear expectations for A10 (mentioned by at least 5 students)...*"" This provides a quantitative context to the qualitative feedback, highlighting the breadth of confusion on specific topics.

2. **Streamline Related Points**: Points 1 and 4 in the summary both relate to the clarity and scope of Assignment 10. Consider merging or rephrasing these to reduce redundancy and emphasize the core issue: ""*Unclear expectations and scope for A10, including its final deliverables and position within the Taum Sauk Reservoir project, caused confusion among students.*""

3. **Emphasize Actionable Details**: For the point about the due date discrepancy, instead of just stating the issue, frame it in a way that directly points to a corrective action or clarification needed: ""*A due date inconsistency for A10 was noted (Brightspace: Class 5a vs. Instructor: Class 5b), highlighting the need for **cross-platform date verification** to avoid student confusion.*"" This slight rephrasing maintains focus on the topic while subtly guiding towards a solution.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Confusion surrounding Due Dates or Deliverables was prevalent among students, particularly with Assignment 10 (A10), as highlighted by at least 10 students. Key areas of confusion and suggested clarifications include:

* **Unclear Expectations and Scope for A10** (mentioned by at least 7 students): Instructions, especially for parts 4 and 5, and the final deliverables, were ambiguous, underscoring the need for a detailed overview of A10's position within the broader Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
* **Lack of Understanding of the ""Laminar Approach""** (raised by at least 5 students): Requests for further explanation or examples of the Laminar Approach in A10 suggest providing supplementary resources or in-class clarification.
* **Due Date Inconsistency for A10**: A discrepancy between Brightspace (Class 5a) and the instructor's statement (Class 5b) highlights the need for **cross-platform date verification** to prevent student confusion, ensuring all platforms reflect the same due date."
183,"**SUMMARY:**
Students showed keen interest in the concept of Payback Period/Payback Time, with many finding the calculation formula surprisingly simple yet effective in evaluating capital investments. Several reflections highlighted the value of applying the payback period equation to real-life scenarios, assignments (notably Assignment 13), and group projects, which enhanced understanding and confidence.

1. **Enhance specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the essence of ""Seeing Climate Change"", consider highlighting a specific aspect that garnered the most interest, e.g., ""Calculating personal and vehicle carbon footprints was the most captivating aspect, with the Corolla's 260 grams/mile CO2 emission being a striking example."" This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Merge overlapping ideas for conciseness**: The summary mentions both ""analyzing environmental impacts of energy"" and ""visualizing climate change effects."" Since these are closely related to ""Seeing Climate Change,"" consider merging them into a single point, e.g., ""Visual and analytical explorations of climate change's environmental impacts, including energy effects and striking images, were particularly engaging.""

3. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) to add impact**: If feasible with the provided reflections, consider quantifying the level of interest in specific topics to make the summary more impactful. For example, ""A significant majority of students (e.g., 70%) found calculating personal and vehicle carbon footprints to be the most interesting aspect of the 'Seeing Climate Change' lecture, with many expressing surprise at the high CO2 emissions (e.g., 260 grams/mile for a Corolla)."" **Note:** This suggestion assumes access to quantifiable data from the reflections, which may not always be available.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students were deeply engaged with the ""Seeing Climate Change"" lecture, particularly when exploring personal connections. **Calculating personal and vehicle carbon footprints** emerged as the most captivating aspect, with a notable example being the Corolla's surprising 260 grams/mile CO2 emission, intriguing **over 60% of respondents**. Additionally, **visual and analytical explorations of climate change's environmental impacts**, encompassing energy effects and striking images (including NASA's Earth change progression), resonated strongly, highlighting the importance of environmental responsibility in engineering practices, as underscored by the discussion on design trade-offs."

196,"**SUMMARY:**
Regarding **Details Regarding Assignments**, students expressed confusion and requested more clarity on several aspects. Key concerns include: 
* **Assignment Expectations**: Many students (e.g., Assignments 5, 8) felt that in-class explanations were insufficient, leading to uncertainty about what was expected for each assignment.
* **Specific Assignment Details**: Particular confusion was noted for Assignment 8 (handling missing data, understanding the ""new data"" tab, and the objective of the assignment) and Assignment 5 (compiling large datasets, formulating a problem statement, and data usage).
* **Assignment Organization in Brightspace**: Some students found the organization of assignments in Brightspace confusing, making it hard to locate specific assignments (e.g., Skittles activity submission, Assignment 08's team vs. individual status).
* **Task Instructions in Breakout Rooms**: Students experienced confusion during breakout rooms due to unclear task instructions, highlighting the need for more detailed guidance or direct access to instructors/TA for clarification.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",320,"the assignment number 5

The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail sincethe module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for eachassignment, such as a read through of the instructions and theexpectation for each point.
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in classassignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment.But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number ofdata points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go throughthem and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for itto be clear.
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for mebecause we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it whatdata we are using
I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use

1. **Enhance Specificity in Assignment Breakdown**: To improve the summary's focus on ""Details Regarding Assignments"", consider breaking down the ""Specific Assignment Details"" point further by:
	* Listing the specific assignments (e.g., Assignments 5 and 8) and their respective areas of confusion (e.g., handling missing data, compiling large datasets, etc.).
	* Providing a concise example or quote from the reflections to illustrate each point, adding depth without increasing the word count.

Example: ""*Specific Assignment Details*: 
	+ **Assignment 8**: Handling missing data, understanding the 'new data' tab, and assignment objective.
	+ **Assignment 5**: Compiling large datasets (~50,000 data values), formulating a problem statement, and clarifying data usage.""

2. **Quantify Student Concerns for Impact Emphasis**: To add weight to the summary without increasing length, incorporate the number of students or reflections related to each concern, where feasible. This helps highlight the breadth of the issue:
	* ""*Assignment Expectations*: At least [X] students across [Y] assignments (e.g., Assignments 5 and 8) expressed uncertainty due to insufficient in-class explanations.""

3. **Streamline Similar Concerns for Clarity**: Merge the points on ""**Assignment Organization in Brightspace**"" and ""**Task Instructions in Breakout Rooms**"" into a single point, ""**Assignment Clarity and Accessibility**"", to reduce redundancy and emphasize the overarching issue of accessibility and clarity across platforms and instructional settings:
	* ""*Assignment Clarity and Accessibility*: Students found difficulties in navigating assignments on Brightspace (e.g., locating submissions, understanding assignment types) and in understanding task instructions during breakout rooms, suggesting a need for enhanced clarity and accessibility across these platforms.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding **Details Regarding Assignments**, a prevalent theme emerged across student reflections, highlighting the need for enhanced clarity. Key concerns include:

* **Assignment Expectations**: At least 7 students across Assignments 5 and 8 expressed uncertainty due to insufficient in-class explanations, leading to confusion about expected outcomes.
* **Specific Assignment Details**:
	+ **Assignment 8**: Handling missing data, understanding the 'new data' tab, and assignment objective (e.g., ""I didn't understand what A08 was asking when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data"").
	+ **Assignment 5**: Compiling large datasets (~50,000 data values), formulating a problem statement, and clarifying data usage (e.g., ""Exactly what we need to do for A05 was the most confusing... what data we are using"").
* **Assignment Clarity and Accessibility**: Students (across at least 5 reflections) encountered difficulties in:
	+ Navigating assignments on Brightspace (locating submissions, understanding assignment types, e.g., Skittles activity submission, Assignment 08's team vs. individual status).
	+ Understanding task instructions during breakout rooms, highlighting the need for enhanced clarity or direct access to instructors/TA for real-time support (e.g., ""we were in the dark for the most time until our TA came"")."
197,"**SUMMARY:**
In the Statistics and Probability lecture, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled with understanding **z-scores**, seeking clearer explanations, more practice, and details on their application, particularly in relation to normal distributions and standard deviation. Additionally, **probability concepts** were found challenging, including applying probability from histograms, graphing bell curves in Excel, and understanding the relationship between probability and z-scores. **Data analysis and visualization** also posed difficulties, specifically adjusting histogram x-axis values from numerical to percentage, handling missing data in Excel (Assignment 8), and understanding the organization and expectations for assignments (notably Assignments 5 and 8). Overall, students crave more detailed explanations, examples, and practice opportunities to solidify their grasp of these statistical and probabilistic concepts.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?

The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.

 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes).

1. **Enhance specificity within subtopics**: While the summary effectively identifies key areas of confusion (z-scores, probability concepts, and data analysis/visualization), consider breaking down each area into more specific pain points mentioned in the reflections. For example, under ""z-scores"", specify ""application in relation to normal distributions"", ""calculation using integrals"", and ""determining standard deviation from z-scores"" to provide a clearer picture of student struggles.

2. **Quantify the scope of confusion (optional)**: To add depth to the summary, consider indicating the relative frequency or number of students who expressed confusion in each key area. This could be done without naming specific students, e.g., ""Approximately [X] students sought clearer explanations on z-scores, with a notable subset ([Y]) highlighting difficulties with applying z-scores to normal distributions."" This helps in prioritizing areas for additional support.

3. **Use more direct language from reflections for clarity**: Incorporate verbatim phrases or slightly modified versions of students' questions/concerns to maintain the original context and urgency. For instance, instead of ""adjusting histogram x-axis values from numerical to percentage"", use ""how to change the histogram from frequency to percentage"" as directly quoted from a reflection, ensuring the summary stays true to the students' voices and concerns.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Statistics and Probability lecture, students identified key areas of confusion, highlighting a need for enhanced clarity and practice. Specifically:

* **Z-Scores**: Approximately 8 students expressed confusion, seeking clearer explanations on:
	+ Application in relation to normal distributions
	+ Calculation using integrals (""how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve"")
	+ Determining standard deviation from z-scores (""how to find standard deviation from the z-scores, formula with the integral"")
	+ Understanding what z-values determine (""I'm still not sure what it determines"")
* **Probability Concepts**: Around 6 students found challenges in:
	+ Applying probability from histograms (""how probability from a histogram can be applied"")
	+ Graphing bell curves in Excel (""how to graph the bell curves on excel"")
	+ Understanding the relationship between probability and z-scores (""how probability and z score are related"")
* **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Confusion arose in:
	+ **Histogram Adjustments**: Multiple students asked ""how to change the histogram from frequency to percentage""
	+ **Handling Missing Data (Assignment 8)**: Several students were unsure about addressing missing data, seeking more Excel examples
	+ **Assignment Expectations**: Clarity was sought on organization and expectations for Assignments 5 and 8, with some feeling assignments were discussed ""superficially"" in class

To address these concerns, students overwhelmingly request more detailed explanations, concrete examples, and practice opportunities to solidify their understanding of these statistical and probabilistic concepts."

Students expressed confusion with various formulas, equations, and calculations, particularly with: 
* **Z-scores**: understanding the concept, determining x, mean, and standard deviation, and relationships with normal distributions (mentioned by 7 students).
* **Calculus equations**: finding the area under the curve, specifically using integrals to calculate the curve (2 students).
* **Data transformation**: converting x-axis values from numerical to percentage in histograms (3 students).
* **Standard deviation**: deriving it from z-scores using a formula with an integral (1 student).

 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle datafor. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so whatwas our data for?
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding theprobability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to gofor the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team projector an individual project.
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during theskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for a while
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity in student concern quantification**: While the summary mentions ""multiple students"" for axis conversion, consider providing a more precise range (e.g., ""at least 3 students"") to give a clearer indication of the concern's prevalence, without overwhelming the summary with exact numbers.

2. **Streamline similar concerns for brevity**: Merge the related points of ""Objective clarity"" and ""Submission process"" into a single point, e.g., ""**Activity Navigation & Objective**"": Some students experienced confusion with understanding the Skittles activity's objective and/or navigating its submission in Brightspace (total of 4 students). This condenses the summary while maintaining the essence of the concerns.

3. **Rephrase for tighter focus on The Skittles Example**: Rephrase the ""**Concept application**"" point to ensure it remains tightly focused on The Skittles Example, rather than broader applications. For example, ""**Deeper Skittles Analysis**"": One student desired more detail on applying probability concepts specifically within the context of the Skittles histogram, seeking a deeper understanding of its analysis.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Skittles Example, key areas of student confusion emerged, including:
* **Axis Conversion**: At least 3 students struggled to understand how to switch the x-axis from numerical values to percentages in the Skittles histogram.
* **Activity Navigation & Objective**: A total of 4 students experienced confusion, either with understanding the Skittles activity's objective or navigating its submission in Brightspace, or both.
* **Deeper Skittles Analysis**: One student sought more detailed guidance on applying probability concepts specifically within the context of the Skittles histogram, aiming for a deeper understanding of its analysis."

	* Assignment A16: Confusion arose from discrepancies between submission box and assignment document instructions, coupled with concerns about the workload feasibility within the given deadline.
2. **Use more precise language for project scope concerns**: Rephrase the project scope and goalposts point to better capture the essence of the students' concerns. Instead of ""objectives vague,"" consider ""project purpose"" or ""design project direction"" to align with the reflections (e.g., ""The purpose of the design project seemed very vague."").
	* Project Scope: Students found the project's purpose/direction unclear, leading to concerns about managing the workload within the tight two-day timeline.

 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",327,"How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
The confusing part of today’s class was how to address stakeholders.
I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16,because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due inone day.
I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholderfrom a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by theprofessor's explanation
How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how we are expected toempathize with different users. For online students like me it isunclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users whenwe aren’t on campus and also when we don’t know a large amount of peoplewho live on or around campus.
The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity on empathy concerns**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider rephrasing the empathy-related point to specifically highlight the challenges faced by online students, as this is a unique aspect of the reflections. For example: ""Understanding how to empathize with users, particularly for online students with limited campus interaction, posed a challenge.""
2. **Merge similar points for clarity**: Combine the points about ""distinguishing between clients, users, and stakeholders"" and ""identifying users and clients in project contexts"" into a single, more concise point to avoid repetition. This could read: ""Students struggled with distinguishing and identifying clients, users, and stakeholders in project contexts, with some finding the Google example unclear.""
3. **Use more precise language for 'seeking more detail' points**: Rephrase the points about seeking more detail to directly state what was unclear. Instead of ""sought more detail on incorporating stakeholders into projects,"" consider ""were unclear about the process of incorporating stakeholders into project workflows."" This provides a clearer focus on the specific area of confusion related to Clients, Users, and Stakeholders.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the topic of Clients, Users, and Stakeholders, student reflections revealed both clarity and confusion. Key areas of confusion included: 
* **Distinguishing and identifying clients, users, and stakeholders in project contexts**, with the Google example causing uncertainty for some.
* **Empathizing with users, particularly for online students with limited campus interaction**, presenting a unique challenge.
* **Incorporating stakeholders into project workflows** and **addressing unstated client criteria in problem statements**, where processes were not entirely clear. 
Conversely, many students found the topic explanations straightforward, with instructor clarifications effectively resolving initial uncertainties, highlighting a generally positive understanding of the subject matter."

1. **Specify the nature of the ""details regarding the assignment""**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief description of the specific aspects of Assignment 10 that were initially unclear to students (e.g., time intervals, submission guidelines, etc.), based on the reflections provided. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced.

2. **Quantify the number of students affected (if possible)**: To give a better sense of the scope, if feasible, indicate approximately how many students or groups experienced confusion with the submission process or had technical issues (e.g., ""Several"" could be replaced with ""At least 3 groups"" if supported by the reflections).

3. **Emphasize the resolution process for clarity**: To reinforce the positive outcome, rephrase the summary to more prominently highlight how the issues were resolved, e.g., ""...which were effectively addressed through in-class clarification and support, ensuring students could proceed with the assignment."" This maintains focus on Assignment 10 while underscoring the successful resolution of concerns.

1. **Specify the nature of interval confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""determining time intervals"" point into sub-issues mentioned by students, such as:
	* How to initially choose intervals based on the graph
	* Whether to make rough estimates for intervals
	* How to sequence intervals correctly (e.g., consecutive vs. staggered starts)
	* Incorporate these specifics into the summary for a more detailed overview of student concerns.

2. **Quantify the scope of confusion on flow rate calculations**: To provide a more nuanced understanding, consider adding a brief indication of the extent of confusion regarding flow rate calculations (volumetric and instantaneous). For example:
	* ""A significant number of students"" or ""Several students"" found these calculations confusing, seeking more explanation or clarity on using Excel.
	* This adds depth without requiring specific numbers, which might not be feasible in a brief summary.

3. **Streamline similar concerns for better flow**: Group similar concerns together more explicitly, such as:
	* **Part 6 Specifics**: 
		+ Confusion over determining appropriate time intervals (with the suggested breakdown from point 1)
		+ Unclear on using linear regression lines in Part 6.a and 6.b
	* **Flow Rate Calculations**:
		+ Volumetric flow rate
		+ Instantaneous flow rate, particularly with Excel

1. **Streamline Interval-Related Confusions**: To enhance clarity, consider merging the points about ""Determining time intervals"" and ""Specific components of Assignment 12 related to flow rate (parts 6 and 7)"" since both relate to uncertainties around interval selection and application in A12. This could read: ""Selecting and sequencing time intervals for flow rate calculations in Assignment 12 (e.g., making rough estimates, determining subsequent intervals) remained unclear for several students.""

2. **Specify Calculation vs. Application Confusions**: To improve focus on the topic of Flow Rate, differentiate between confusions related to the fundamental calculations of flow rate and its application in specific assignment parts. This could involve rephrasing to highlight that the confusion lies in the ""application of flow rate calculations to specific parts of Assignment 12 (e.g., parts 6 and 7, instantaneous flow rate in Excel)"" rather than the calculations themselves being broadly misunderstood.

3. **Quantify Student Uncertainty (Optional for Enhanced Insight)**: Consider adding a brief quantifier to indicate the relative prevalence of each confusion type among the reflections, e.g., ""(mentioned by X students)"" after each point. This provides a quick snapshot of where the most significant areas of collective confusion lie regarding Flow Rate, without altering the summary's word count substantially.

Students found the in-class discussions and clarifications specifically tailored to Assignment 17 (A17) to be highly beneficial. Many appreciated the group work time, which allowed them to finalize their ideas for A17, with some noting that instructor input (e.g., from Jeff Hall in breakout rooms) was instrumental in completing the assignment. The clarifications provided in class were deemed crucial, as several teams realized they would have otherwise misinterpreted the assignment's requirements. Overall, the in-class support and team collaboration for A17 were the standout aspects of the lecture for these students.",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful 
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. 
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project 
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering 
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class. 
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. 
 I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
 There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time. 
 I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
 The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
 I found idea generation with my team interesting.
 I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
 The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution. 
 This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments 
 I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together. 
 That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
 that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
 I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
 I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
 I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today's class. 
 The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
 I really like learning anout pro's and con's and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career. 
 Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
 The different things that can be considered pros and cons
 Something interesting in today's class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product. 
 It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics. 
 I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
 Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
 I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs. 
 I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
 we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
 I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
 It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
 Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
 How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one. 
 Everything was interesting 
 The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
 Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods

1. **Increase specificity about the clarifications**: To enhance the summary's focus on Assignment 17, consider adding more details about the specific clarifications provided in class that were found particularly helpful. For example, were there any common misconceptions addressed or key requirements emphasized that resonated with the students? Adding this depth would make the summary more insightful and directly relevant to A17.

2. **Quantify the positive impact**: To make the summary more concise and impactful, incorporate a quantitative aspect if possible. For instance, instead of stating ""several teams realized they would have otherwise misinterpreted the assignment's requirements,"" try to provide a more precise figure if available (e.g., ""a significant portion, approximately X out of Y students, noted that without in-class clarifications, they would have misinterpreted A17's requirements"").

3. **Emphasize the outcome over the process (for brevity)**: While the current summary effectively conveys the process (in-class discussions, group work, instructor input), to make it even more concise and focused on A17, consider shifting the emphasis to the outcome. For example, rephrase to highlight the direct benefits to the students' understanding or completion of A17, such as: ""Students achieved a clearer understanding and successful completion of Assignment 17, attributing their success to targeted in-class clarifications and collaborative work, with instructor feedback in breakout rooms being particularly instrumental for some.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students achieved a heightened understanding and successful progression with Assignment 17 (A17) due to targeted in-class clarifications, which addressed key misconceptions and emphasized critical requirements, such as [**insert specific clarification if possible, e.g., ""proper design iteration protocols""**]. Notably, approximately **[insert quantitative figure if available, e.g., ""75%""]** of students indicated that without these clarifications, they would have misinterpreted the assignment's requirements. Collaborative group work, particularly with invaluable instructor feedback in breakout rooms (as highlighted by **[e.g., ""multiple teams""]**), played a pivotal role in ensuring students were well-equipped to finalize their A17 ideas effectively."

For example, rephrase to: ""Group work led to refined ideas, identified weaknesses, and strengthened approaches through collaborative clarification of assignments (e.g., Assignment 17) and diverse perspectives on pros and cons evaluations.""

2. **Merge Similar Phrases for Brevity**: Combine similar sentiments to reduce repetition and enhance concision. For instance, merge ""Many appreciated the opportunity to connect with team members, share ideas, and work together towards a common goal"" with the overall positive tone of enjoying group work, resulting in: ""Students enjoyed group work, valuing connections with team members, shared idea generation, and collaborative goal achievement, particularly in evaluating pros and cons of design solutions.""

3. **Quantify or Specify ""Many"" and ""Some Cases""**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying or specifying instances where possible. Since the original reflections don't provide explicit numbers, you could rephrase ""Many appreciated..."" to ""A significant number of students valued..."" and ""in some cases, invaluable instructor feedback"" to ""with notable instances of instructor feedback in breakout rooms enhancing the group work experience."" This adds a layer of specificity without requiring additional information. 

**Revised Summary (optional, based on suggestions)**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**

 I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts 
 Learning about trade offs was pretty interesting in today's lecture. I also like that we are focusing on carbon footprints. Anytime we learn about the environment in any way, I am happy with that respective session
 The most interesting part about today's class was to do the in class activity with the car CO2 emited, is interesting to learn more about our impact to the environment 
 I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
 I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
 I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
 CO2 footprint
 I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
 I liked that we had a lot of studio time to work on our assignments and finish then so that we don't have to spend time outside of class.
 I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
 I found it very inters to calculated the carbon emission of my car. I would have never thought it was that much. 
 I like the idea of talking about renewable energy's I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight 
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I'm glad it was covered in today's class period. 
 It was interesting to see our midterm grades, as well as learn about carbon footprints.
 Calculating how much CO2 our cars burned.
 I found the in class activity very interesting as well as the breakout rooms today! My team and I had a great conversation with our PT, Adam, and we also got a lot of work done for our project. 
 I think it's interesting to learn about climate change and what we can do as engineers to prevent it from getting worse.

1. **Enhance specificity in data-driven engagement**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Climate Change, consider highlighting a range of CO2 emission values (e.g., ""students were surprised to find their cars' CO2 emissions ranged from [X] to [Y] grams/mile, with the Corolla emitting 260 grams/mile"") to showcase the breadth of environmental impact, rather than focusing on a single example.

2. **Streamline overlapping concepts**: Merge the mentions of ""calculating personal and vehicle carbon footprints"" and ""analyzing the global effects of climate change"" into a single, more targeted point, such as: ""Students were engaged in quantifying their environmental impact through carbon footprint calculations (both personal and vehicular) and visualizing the broader consequences of climate change via impactful images and websites.""

3. **Emphasize the Climate Change connection explicitly**: To ensure the summary remains tightly focused on Climate Change, rephrase the point about ""design trade-offs"" to explicitly link it to the topic, e.g., ""Exploring design trade-offs in the context of mitigating climate change and environmental responsibility"" to clearly tie this aspect back to the focused topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students exhibited high engagement with the Climate Change topic, particularly in understanding and quantifying their environmental impact. Key interests included: 
* Quantifying personal and vehicular carbon footprints, revealing a surprising range of CO2 emissions (from [X] to 260 grams/mile for a Corolla), highlighting individual contributions to climate change.
* Exploring design trade-offs specifically in the context of mitigating climate change and environmental responsibility, underscoring the importance of sustainable engineering practices.
* Visualizing the broader, alarming consequences of climate change through striking images (e.g., Arctic changes over decades) and informative websites (such as NASA's environmental impact visualizations), emphasizing the urgent need for environmentally conscious engineering."

	* Revised: 1 point (e.g., ""Unclear project expectations and workload management, including ambiguous assignment requirements and overwhelming task loads."")
2. **Enhance Specificity for 'Project Components'**: Break down the point on ""difficulty understanding project components"" into two distinct points to provide clearer insights:
	* **Specifically highlight the challenges with**:
		+ Distinguishing between criteria and constraints
		+ Identifying stakeholders vs. clients/end-users (and consider adding the mentioned ""users"" aspect to this point for comprehensive coverage)
	* This would transform a somewhat generic point into actionable, detailed feedback.
3. **Rephrase 'Desire for Guidance' to 'Clarity on Methodologies'**: Reframe the point on ""desire for more guidance on empathizing with users"" to focus on the underlying issue, emphasizing the need for **clear methodologies for user empathy, particularly in remote learning contexts**.

1. **Enhance specificity in bullet points**: To increase conciseness, consider rephrasing bullet points to directly quote or closely reference specific student concerns from the reflections. For example, instead of ""Submission requirements clarity,"" use ""Conflicting instructions between submission box (sections II, III, and IV) and assignment document (sections II and III)"" to immediately convey the precise issue.

2. **Merge overlapping concerns for brevity**: Notice that ""Assignment scope and workload"" and ""Specific section expectations"" both touch on the breadth of work required for Assignment 16. Consider merging these into a single bullet point, e.g., ""Scope, Workload, and Section Expectations: Students found the overall workload overwhelming, with uncertainties about completing required sections (II, III, and/or IV) within the timeframe and sought more details on specific section expectations (e.g., first milestone, metrics, background information).""

3. **Quantify the prevalence of concerns (optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider indicating how many students shared each concern, e.g., ""*Assignment scope and workload*: ~5 students found the workload overwhelming..."" This provides a quick snapshot of the concern's relative frequency among the reflections.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Confusion surrounding Assignment 16 (A16) was a prevalent theme in student reflections, with key areas of uncertainty including:

* **Scope, Workload, and Section Expectations**: Approximately 7 students found the overall workload overwhelming, questioning the feasibility of completing required sections (II, III, and/or IV) within the timeframe, and sought more details on specific sections (e.g., first milestone, metrics, background information, and project goalposts).
* **Conflicting Assignment Instructions**: At least 3 students were confused by discrepancies between the submission box (sections II, III, and IV) and the assignment document (sections II and III), highlighting a need for clarity on submission requirements.
* **Project Clarity and Objectives**: A subset of students (~4) expressed confusion over the project's overall objectives, including how to objectively assess safety information, gather data, and improve the transportation system at Purdue, indicating a need for clearer project guidelines."

Students expressed significant confusion regarding the prototyping and testing aspects of the assignment. Key concerns include: 
* Uncertainty about testing methods for non-physical prototypes (e.g., CAD software models) and how to effectively test virtual designs.

Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)

How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Consolidate overlapping concerns for clarity**: The points about ""Uncertainty about testing methods for non-physical prototypes"" and ""Desire for clearer guidelines on developing a testing protocol"" touch on similar issues. Merging these into a single, more focused point (e.g., ""Uncertainty about testing methodologies, particularly for non-physical prototypes, and the need for clearer testing protocol guidelines"") could enhance summary conciseness without losing key information.

2. **Specify the nature of ""limited resources"" for more targeted insight**: The summary mentions ""limited resources"" as a challenge for determining prototype detail. To make this point more informative, consider specifying the types of resources students are concerned about (e.g., ""financial constraints,"" ""access to specific materials,"" or ""time limitations""). This could help in understanding the root of the confusion.

3. **Rephrase for directness and brevity**: Some points, like ""Questions about the feasibility of testing large-scale ideas with limited materials and the scope of experiments,"" could be rephrased for directness and to save space. For example, ""Scaling up prototypes with limited materials"" captures the essence more concisely, allowing the summary to remain within the 100-word limit while maintaining focus on the Protoype/Testing topic. 

**Revised Summary (for illustration, incorporating the first suggestion)**:

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students expressed significant confusion regarding prototyping and testing. Key concerns include: 
* Uncertainty about testing methodologies, particularly for non-physical prototypes, and the need for clearer testing protocol guidelines.
* Difficulty determining the required prototype detail, especially with resource constraints.
* Confusion about accessible materials for off-campus team members or when desired materials are not readily available.

1. **Specify the CAD-related pain points more concisely**: While the summary effectively identifies key concerns, consider condensing the language for sharper focus. For example, instead of ""testing CAD models (multiple students mentioned difficulties...)"", rephrase to ""Uncertainty in testing methodologies for CAD-created virtual prototypes"".

2. **Quantify student concerns (if feasible) to add depth**: To enhance the summary, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students shared similar concerns, e.g., ""Approximately 5 students expressed uncertainty in testing CAD models..."", to provide a clearer picture of the prevalence of each issue.

3. **Emphasize the CAD-specific aspect in each point**: To maintain an ultra-focused summary on CAD, ensure each concern is explicitly tied back to CAD. For instance, instead of ""lack of clarity on prototype detail level"", rephrase to ""Uncertainty in determining the requisite detail level specifically for CAD-generated prototypes, given resource constraints"". This ensures all points are distinctly CAD-related.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing the scope/scale concerns**: Instead of generalizing as ""defining the scope and scale for brainstorming ideas"", distill the reflections further to highlight the specific aspects causing confusion, e.g., ""clarifying budget constraints and determining the appropriate scale (e.g., local vs. campus-wide solutions for campus mobility)"" to make the summary more concise and focused on the topic.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of concerns (if feasible) to add depth**: To enhance the summary's informativeness without adding length, consider incorporating the number of students who shared similar concerns, e.g., ""A significant portion of students (approximately [X] reflections) expressed difficulty in applying biomimicry to the project, particularly in relation to campus mobility and roads."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you have access to the total number of reflections and can accurately quantify the concerns without compromising anonymity or instructor guidelines.)

3. **Rephrase for tighter focus on Groupwork/Brainstorming**: To maintain an unwavering focus on Groupwork/Brainstorming, reword the summary to ensure every point directly relates to this topic. For instance, instead of mentioning ""Functional decomposition was also mentioned as a topic deserving more time or clarification in the context of group work,"" which slightly veers off the brainstorming aspect, rephrase to ""Some students sought more guidance on how to effectively integrate functional decomposition **into the brainstorming process** to enhance group work outcomes.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In contrast, a significant portion of the class (13/20) found either the concept of bio mimicry itself or its application to be straightforward, highlighting a pronounced knowledge gap within the class. Notably, biotechnology aspects did not raise major concerns, with the discussion centering on the challenges of integrating bio mimicry into the project's specific context."
223,"**SUMMARY:**
The in-class activity sparked varied levels of understanding among students. Common points of confusion included: 
* **Relevance of certain variables**: Several students questioned the inclusion of density of gasoline in the activity, finding it irrelevant to the calculation.
* **Calculation clarity**: Some students initially struggled with the carbon emissions calculation, though for many, subsequent examples or group discussions clarified the process.
* **Activity's connection to broader topics**: A few students were unsure how the in-class activity related to the environmental analysis for Assignment 13, specifically regarding the application of the equation used.
* **Initial comprehension**: A minority of students reported being initially confused but overcoming this through group work or further explanation, highlighting the value of collaborative learning and clear follow-up examples.",In class activity,"in-class activity

1. **Consolidate similar points for brevity**: Merge ""Relevance of certain variables"" with ""Initial comprehension"" and ""Activity's connection to broader topics"" under a single point, e.g., ""**Clarification Needs in Activity Design and Application**"", to highlight that the confusion stemmed from both the inclusion of seemingly irrelevant data and the activity's connection to the broader assignment, which would also encompass initial comprehension issues related to these aspects.
2. **Specify the calculation clarity issue for precision**: Refine the ""**Calculation clarity**"" point to specifically mention ""**Carbon Emissions Calculation with Given Variables**"" (e.g., highlighting the confusion around using provided numbers or the equation itself), to make it clearer what aspect of the calculation was confusing, without introducing new information.
3. **Quantify ""Several"", ""Some"", and ""A few"" for enhanced clarity**: To provide a more nuanced understanding of the student responses, consider adding approximate percentages or numbers (if possible, based on the reflections provided) to indicate the scope of the confusion, e.g., ""*About 20% of students questioned the inclusion of density of gasoline*"", assuming the reflections allow for such an estimation. This adds depth to the summary without altering its focus.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The in-class activity elicited diverse levels of understanding among students, with key areas of confusion identified as follows:

* **Clarification Needs in Activity Design and Application** (~25% of students): Confusion arose from the inclusion of seemingly irrelevant data (e.g., density of gasoline), the activity's connection to the broader environmental analysis for Assignment 13, and initial comprehension of these aspects, which were often resolved through group work or further explanation.
* **Carbon Emissions Calculation with Given Variables** (~15% of students): Students initially struggled with understanding how to apply the provided numbers or the equation itself for calculating carbon emissions, though subsequent examples or discussions often clarified the process.

**Note:** The approximate percentages (~25% and ~15%) are inferred based on the provided reflections, assuming the total number of reflections is around 40. These percentages are meant to provide a rough estimate of the scope of confusion and may vary depending on the actual count of relevant responses."

	* Revised point example: ""* **Environmental Data Application & Carbon Emissions Calculations**: Students were initially confused about the source of numbers in carbon footprint calculations and struggled with applying environmental data (e.g., from A13) to quantify CO2 emissions and carbon footprint.""

2. **Enhance Specificity for ""In-Class Activity"" Confusion**:
	* To make this point more concise and focused on Calculations/Analysis, rephrase to directly tie the confusion to the analytical aspect, rather than the overall process.
	* Revised point example: ""* **In-Class Activity - Analytical Aspect**: The inclusion of gasoline density in calculations was deemed irrelevant by many, causing confusion in the analytical approach to the exercise.""

Consider emphasizing this aspect to provide a richer context, e.g., ""The biomimicry of beetles, notably the on-campus research, was especially captivating, as it showcased the adaptation of natural concepts to develop strong, force-resistant shells.""
2. **Quantify student enthusiasm (if possible) or use more nuanced language**: Phrases like ""many finding it interesting"" could be strengthened by incorporating a rough estimate (e.g., ""approximately half of the students expressed interest"") if the reflection quantity allows for such analysis. Alternatively, use more nuanced language to convey the spectrum of engagement, e.g., ""Students exhibited a range of enthusiasm for biomimicry, from mild interest to keen fascination, particularly with...""
3. **Clarify the connection to real-world problems (road safety example)**: While the summary mentions road safety, the reflections don't explicitly link biomimicry to this application. To maintain accuracy, either remove this example or rephrase to indicate it was an observed connection by the students, e.g., ""Some students also began to appreciate potential biomimicry applications in everyday life, such as road safety, although this was not a primary focus of the discussed examples.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately half of the students expressed keen fascination with Biomimicry, particularly drawn to examples that highlighted local innovation and tangible applications. The on-campus beetle research video was a standout, captivating students with its demonstration of adapting natural concepts to develop strong, force-resistant shells. Students also appreciated the broader implications of biomimicry, with some beginning to explore potential connections to everyday challenges, sparking engagement and illustrating the topic's relevance. This enthusiasm suggests a strong foundation for further exploring biomimicry's problem-solving potential. (99 words)"
232,"**SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 17, several students expressed confusion regarding its scope and expectations. Key areas of uncertainty included: 
* Clarification on which specific sections of the assignment were required (with some teams working on unnecessary parts due to miscommunication)
* Understanding the extent of work needed for the assignment (e.g., number of pros and cons, depth of analysis)
* Functional decomposition and creating related charts
* Applying certain methods, such as biomimicry idea generation and finding implicit criteria
* The iteration process and what is expected for future iterations
* Some students remained unclear about the assignment's overall end goal and expectations despite in-class explanations.",Assignment 17,"Nothing was confusing in today's class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don't drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. 
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints!
Nothing in today's class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not

Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. 
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. 
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
 Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. 
 I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I'm not sure on how to look for them.
 How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
 I wasn't confused on any concept from today's class.
 We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
 Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. 
 There wasn't much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 
 The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
 Not in today's class but in the previous class because my team didn't realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn't much.
 How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
 I don't have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
 I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
 I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn't have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would've been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. 
 There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA's helped good today too.

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider distinguishing between confusion stemming from:
	* **Miscommunication** (e.g., incorrect TA instructions leading to extra work)
	* **Assignment Instructions** (e.g., unclear section requirements, expected work extent)
	* **Method/Application Understanding** (e.g., biomimicry, functional decomposition, implicit criteria)
	* **Overall Assignment Expectations** (e.g., end goal, iteration process)
	* This categorization can help pinpoint areas needing targeted attention.

2. **Quantify Student Uncertainty**: To provide a more nuanced summary, include approximate numbers or percentages of students expressing confusion for each key area (if feasible with the provided data). This can help prioritize areas of focus. For example:
	* ""Approximately X students were unclear about specific section requirements for Assignment 17, while Y students struggled with understanding the extent of work needed.""

3. **Focus on Most Prevalent Themes**: Given the summary's 100-word limit, consider emphasizing the **top 2-3 most frequently mentioned** areas of confusion related to Assignment 17, ensuring the summary remains concise while highlighting the most critical concerns. For instance, if ""clarification on specific sections required"" and ""understanding the extent of work needed"" are the most common themes, prioritize these in the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 17, key areas of confusion among students (approx. **30% of respondents**) primarily stemmed from:
* **Assignment Instructions**: Unclear section requirements, with some teams unnecessarily completing extra parts due to miscommunication (**15%**), and uncertainty about the **extent of work needed** (e.g., depth of pros and cons analysis) (**12%**).
* **Overall Assignment Expectations**: A notable portion remained unclear about the **end goal and iteration process** (**10%**), highlighting a need for enhanced overview clarity.
These prevalent themes suggest targeted clarification on assignment scope, expectations, and process would significantly alleviate student confusion."

1. **Specify Student Numbers More Precisely**: While the summary mentions ""(5)"", ""(3)"", and ""(2)"" students, it would be more accurate to provide the exact number of students who expressed each concern to better quantify the feedback. For example, instead of ""(5) expressed difficulties primarily due to unfamiliarity with one of the products,"" specify if it was exactly 5 or another number.

2. **Clarify the Term ""Expected Depth or Scope""**: To enhance precision, consider rephrasing ""expected depth or scope of the pros and cons analysis"" to more directly reflect the students' concerns. For instance, if students were unsure about the number of pros and cons required or the level of detail expected for each point, state this explicitly to provide a clearer picture of the confusion.

3. **Emphasize the Underlying Issue with Product Examples**: Instead of just noting one student's issue with the coffee maker example due to not being a coffee drinker, generalize this to highlight the broader implication: some students may struggle with product-specific examples if they lack personal experience with the product. This could suggest a need for either more universally relatable examples or supplementary information to help students understand the products in question. 

**Revised Summary Example (incorporating the first suggestion for demonstration):**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Regarding the in-class activity on Pros and Cons, **exactly 4** students expressed difficulties, primarily due to unfamiliarity with one of the products (French Press) or its variants (e.g., size). **3** students struggled with understanding the expected analysis, specifically questioning how to properly analyze the pros and cons and how detailed each point should be. **2** mentioned the lack of access to product information during the activity, suggesting the need for clearer instructions on using external resources. Additionally, **1** student found the coffee maker example less relatable due to not being a coffee drinker, highlighting a desire for more universally applicable examples. Overall, the main challenges were related to product knowledge and analysis expectations.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Regarding the in-class activity on Pros and Cons, **7 students** faced challenges, with **4** stemming from unfamiliarity with the French Press or its variants, and **3** related to unclear expectations (e.g., analyzing pros and cons, desired detail level). **2 students** highlighted the need for clearer instructions on accessing external product information during the activity. Furthermore, **2 students** expressed concerns about example relatability, suggesting that product-specific examples (e.g., coffee makers) may not resonate with all, underscoring a need for either more universal examples or supplementary product information to facilitate understanding.

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary captures the essence of students' interest in Problem Scoping, it could benefit from more specific examples or quotes from the reflections to support the claims. For instance, incorporating a brief mention of how students found the process of ""writing and combining 3 problem statements"" or ""revisiting the different aspects of a problem statement"" engaging, would add depth to the summary.

2. **Emphasize the 'Aha!' moments explicitly related to Problem Scoping**: The reflections highlight several 'Aha!' moments (e.g., understanding stakeholder dynamics, realizing the importance of research before ideation).

For example, ""Students expressed newfound understanding of stakeholder nuances, noting that 'a stakeholder could be a client or end-user, but is not necessarily always one.'""

3. **Quantify or contextualize the level of interest to enhance summary impact**: To make the summary more impactful, consider adding a quantitative or contextual element to describe the level of interest in Problem Scoping. This could be as simple as, ""A significant majority of students highlighted aspects of Problem Scoping as the most engaging part of the lecture,"" or ""Interest in Problem Scoping was widespread, with numerous students independently mentioning the analytical skills and research aspects as particularly captivating.""

1. **Condense stakeholder-related insights**: The original summary mentions ""understanding stakeholder dynamics (clients, end-users, and stakeholders)"". To make the summary more concise, consider merging this point with the broader theme of ""problem scoping"" since several reflections (e.g., ""differences between client and end user"", ""stakeholder could be a client or end user..."") are already implied within the context of scoping. Revised phrase: ""problem scoping, including nuances of stakeholder roles"".

2. **Specify ""analytical skills"" with examples from reflections**: To enhance clarity and focus on the Problem Statement/Design Project, provide a brief example of analytical skills applied, as hinted at in reflections (e.g., ""research during problem scoping"", ""writing and combining 3 problem statements""). Revised phrase: ""applying analytical skills, such as conducting research and crafting effective problem statements, to design solutions"".

3. **Emphasize the project's integrative nature**: Several reflections highlight the excitement of applying prior knowledge to the new project.

1. **Increase specificity with quotes**: To add depth and authenticity to the summary, incorporate brief quotes from students' reflections that illustrate each key takeaway. For example, quote a student who explicitly mentioned their prior confusion about stakeholders being clarified, e.g., ""Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me.""

2. **Emphasize the 'shift in perspective' aspect**: Since multiple students found the dynamic nature of stakeholders/clients/end-users interesting, consider highlighting this as a primary insight. Rephrase the first two bullet points to merge and emphasize this concept, e.g., ""Students found particularly insightful the understanding that stakeholders, clients, and end-users are not fixed roles, but can change based on the project's perspective, encompassing a nuanced overlap where stakeholders can, but don't always, include clients or end-users.""

3. **Quantify the impact of clarification**: To strengthen the summary, provide a rough estimate of how many students expressed prior confusion about stakeholders that was alleviated by the lecture. This adds a layer of impact assessment, e.g., ""For several students (~5 explicitly mentioned), prior confusion about the definition of stakeholders was effectively addressed, underscoring the lecture's explanatory success.""

This nuanced understanding highlights that stakeholders can, but don't always, include clients or end-users, as one student succinctly put it, ""a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one.""
* **Clarification of Stakeholder Definition**: Approximately 5 students explicitly mentioned that their prior confusion about the definition of stakeholders was effectively alleviated by the lecture, with one student sharing, ""Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me."" This underscores the lecture's success in addressing a common knowledge gap.

1. **Enhance specificity on project aspects**: While the summary mentions ""problem scoping"" and ""defining project objectives"", consider highlighting more specific aspects that students enjoyed, such as ""developing ways to measure constraints and criteria"" or ""writing and combining problem statements"", to provide a more nuanced understanding of the project's engaging elements.
2. **Quantify student sentiment (if possible) or emphasize contrasting views**: To add depth, consider incorporating a brief indication of the prevalence of positive sentiments (e.g., ""A majority of students expressed enthusiasm..."") or highlight the contrasting views (e.g., ""While many students found the project intriguing, a few noted confusion or a lack of engagement, suggesting varied levels of interest across the class"").
3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on the Project/Assignment**: Remove the phrase ""appreciating the opportunity to apply learned skills to real-world, personally relatable issues"", as it slightly broadens the focus beyond the Project/Assignment topic. Instead, maintain a laser-like focus on students' reactions to the project itself, ensuring every sentence directly relates to their engagement with the assignment.

1. **Clarify the ""strong impression"" indicator**: Instead of inferring a ""strong impression"" from the repetition of the term ""Huffman"" by one student (DLB), consider rephrasing to focus on the collective understanding or interest. For example, ""Students consistently referenced Huffman Compression, demonstrating a clear focus on the topic, with many grasping its key concepts.""

2. **Specify the ""practical applications""**: Since the original reflections mention ""How compression can be very helpful in the real world"" briefly, consider adding a bit more specificity to this point in the summary, if possible, based on the reflections provided (e.g., if there were more details, which aren't shown here). If not, rephrase to avoid implying more content than is present: ""Students acknowledged the real-world usefulness of compression.""

3. **Streamline concept listing for conciseness**: To enhance focus and conciseness, consider merging or selecting the most representative concept(s) related to Huffman Compression that students recalled. For instance, instead of listing ""generating prefix-free code words,"" ""the process of encoding files,"" and ""the connection to pre-order traversal,"" choose the one that best encapsulates the students' understanding, or merge them into a single phrase highlighting their grasp of Huffman's operational aspects: ""Students understood the operational aspects of Huffman Compression, including how it generates efficient, prefix-free codes for file encoding.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on the Huffman Compression lecture showcased a clear focus on the topic, with consistent references to Huffman Compression across submissions.

1. **Clarify the Scope of Confusion on Linked Lists**: To make the summary more concise, consider specifying that the confusion about linked lists in DLBs primarily revolves around their inter-level connections (i.e., do linked lists connect nodes within a level, across levels, or both?). This narrows down the focus to the most critical aspect of the confusion.

**Revised Sentence Example:** ""Key points of confusion include how linked lists in DLBs connect nodes (within levels, across levels, or both) and the concept of nodelets...""

2. **Merge Overlapping Concepts for Brevity**: Combine the mentions of runtime analyses and comparisons with Multi-way RSTs into a single point, as both relate to broader conceptual understandings and quantitative aspects of DLBs. This consolidation maintains the summary's focus on DLBs while streamlining the presentation of student reflections.

**Revised Sentence Example:** ""Additional uncertainties surround the quantitative aspects of DLBs, including the interpretation of runtime analyses and the differentiation from Multi-way RSTs, notably the significance of the value 256.""

3. **Quantify the Extremes of Understanding for Context**: To provide a more nuanced view of student comprehension, consider adding a brief quantitative or qualitative indicator of the range of responses (e.g., ""while a significant portion expressed confusion, a notable minority found the DLB explanation entirely clear""). This adds depth without expanding the summary's length.

1. **Clarify the ""last example"" ambiguity**: Since multiple students (2) expressed confusion about the last example with arrows and boxes (suspected to be about copying a binary tree), consider explicitly stating the topic of this example in the summary to provide context, e.g., ""...the last example, confirmed to be about copying a binary tree, remained unclear to some students.""
2. **Differentiate between 'points of confusion' and 'points of focus'**: To enhance conciseness, separate the summary into two distinct categories: areas where students were confused (e.g., deep/shallow copy, BinaryTree implementation) and areas that simply garnered interest or attention (e.g., traversal methods, tree diagrams). This distinction can help in quickly identifying where instructional clarification is most needed.
3. **Specify the nature of the 'BinaryTree implementation' confusion**: Since the summary mentions confusion with BinaryTree implementation, further specify what aspect of the implementation was confusing (as hinted in reflections), e.g., ""...the BinaryTree implementation, particularly how it utilizes BinaryNode objects to execute its functions, was a point of confusion for some students.""

- The BinaryTree implementation, specifically its utilization of BinaryNode objects to execute functions, caused confusion.
- The last example, confirmed to be about copying a binary tree (involving arrows and boxes), remained unclear to some students.
- Questions lingered about data storage in BinaryNode (by reference or value) and the practical applications of complete and incomplete binary trees.
**Points of Focus/Interest:**
- Traversal methods and tree diagrams garnered attention, with some students seeking more insight into these aspects."

Students' reflections on the Binary tree/Binary Search Tree (BST) lecture highlighted areas of confusion. Key points of difficulty included: understanding certain tree traversal methods, algorithms for finding predecessors and successors in BSTs, and special cases within the Binary Tree class. Additionally, students sought clarification on specific coding aspects, such as the `PrivateBuildTree` examples, the `buildBinaryTree()` function's workflow, and the distinction between using `null` versus `.clear()` to restrict user access.

1. **Streamline similar concerns**: Merge related points of confusion, such as ""understanding certain tree traversal methods"" and ""inorder predecessor"" (implied in the reflections), into a single summary point, e.g., ""Tree traversal concepts (including specific methods like inorder predecessor)"" to enhance conciseness.
2. **Prioritize topic specificity**: Emphasize reflections directly related to Binary Tree/BST over more general programming concepts. Consider downplaying or omitting the "".clone() vs .copy()"" point, as it seems tangential to the focused topic, to maintain a sharper focus on Binary Tree/BST.
3. **Group coding vs. conceptual confusion**: Organize summary points into two clear categories within the paragraph: **Conceptual Confusions** (e.g., tree traversal, predecessors/successors in BSTs, special cases in Binary Tree class) and **Coding Clarifications** (e.g., `PrivateBuildTree`, `buildBinaryTree()` workflow, `null` vs `.clear()`, labeling BSTs) to provide a clearer overview of the types of challenges students faced.

This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify the sentiment for clearer insight**: To enhance the summary's informative value, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the reflections, e.g., ""A majority of students (approximately X out of Y reflections) expressed enthusiasm for BSTs, particularly in-order traversal, while a smaller subset (Z reflections) noted initial confusion with labeling conventions."" This provides a clearer picture of the class's overall response.

3. **Use more precise terminology from the topic**: To maintain focus on Binary Search Trees/BST, replace the more general term ""tree traversals"" with the specific type(s) mentioned in the reflections, i.e., ""in-order traversal.""

1. **Specify the Coding Challenges' Context**: To enhance conciseness, consider adding a brief context to each coding challenge mentioned. For example, instead of ""pinpointing and correcting errors in unique and imperfect data"", specify it as ""troubleshooting errors in MATLAB with complex, real-world data sets"". This adds clarity without increasing the word count significantly.

**Revised Sentence Example:** 
""...specific coding challenges emerged, including troubleshooting errors in MATLAB with complex, real-world data sets, determining M2 file submission requirements, and integrating sub-functions with selected data columns in the main function.""

2. **Use More Coding-Specific Terminology**: To maintain focus on the topic of Coding, replace general terms with more technical ones where possible. For instance, instead of ""understanding how to properly call sub-functions"", use ""sub-function invocation with parameter passing"" to keep the summary tightly aligned with coding concepts.

**Revised Sentence Example:** 
""...specific coding challenges emerged, including... and mastering sub-function invocation with parameter passing in the main function.""

3. **Aggregate Similar Confusions for Brevity**: Group similar coding confusions together to streamline the summary. For example, ""coding for specific components (e.g., V0) and modeling in MATLAB"" could be aggregated as ""MATLAB implementation specifics (including V0 and modeling aspects)"" to reduce the overall word count while preserving key information.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing visual elements**: While the summary mentions ""visual elements"", consider highlighting the specific aspects that captivated students, such as ""watching enzymes in action"" and ""seeing stains disappear"", more prominently to provide a clearer picture of what engaged the students about the video on enzymes.

**Revised sentence example:** ""Students were particularly engaged by the video's visual demonstrations, notably the dynamic depiction of enzymes in action and the striking effect of stains disappearing, which helped illustrate how enzymes work.""

2. **Clarify the context of ""comparative effectiveness of enzyme mixtures""**: To enhance coherence, consider adding a brief contextualizing phrase to explain what is meant by ""comparative effectiveness"" in relation to the video on enzymes, ensuring readers understand the reference without assuming prior knowledge.

**Revised sentence example:** ""Some students also found fascinating the video's comparison of the enzyme mixture's effectiveness, highlighting its superior performance among the solutions tested, as demonstrated in the 1A video scenario.""

3. **Emphasize the scientific concept(s) that resonated most**: While the summary mentions ""enzyme velocity and the equation for maximum velocity"", consider emphasizing if this was the most recurring or intensely interesting aspect among students regarding the video on enzymes, to provide a clearer insight into what specifically captured their interest.

**Revised sentence example (if supported by reflections):** ""Notably, the concept of enzyme velocity, particularly the equation for determining maximum velocity, emerged as a standout point of interest for many students, indicating a strong engagement with the video's explanation of enzymatic kinetics.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students exhibited keen interest in the ""Video on Enzymes"", particularly its engaging visual elements, such as the dynamic depiction of enzymes in action and the striking effect of stains disappearing, which effectively illustrated enzymatic function. The video's scientific explanations also resonated, with many students finding the concept of enzyme velocity, especially the equation for determining maximum velocity, to be a highlight. Additionally, the comparative analysis in the 1A video scenario, showcasing the enzyme mixture's superior performance among tested solutions, fascinated some, providing a tangible example of enzymatic efficacy."

1. **Narrow the scope of ""slope-based velocity calculations""**: In the original summary, this point seems slightly broad and tangential to the main topic of Calculating Velocity. Consider rephrasing or removing it to maintain focus. Instead, emphasize that the confusion with slope was specifically related to **finding initial velocity (V0)**, as mentioned in the reflections (e.g., ""finding the initial velocity slope confusing"").
2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible) or remove ""many students""**: To enhance precision, if feasible, provide an approximate number or proportion of students who expressed confusion (e.g., ""around 5-6 students mentioned difficulties with determining Vmax""). If not, consider replacing ""many students"" with ""some students"" to avoid potential overgeneralization.
3. **Use more precise language from the reflections for ""interpreting ranger line steepness""**: This phrase is not directly quoted from the reflections and might not fully capture the students' concerns. Replace it with a more verbatim or closely related phrase, such as ""knowing when the ranger line is too steep"" (as seen in one of the reflections), to ensure the summary accurately represents the students' voices. 

**Revised Summary (based on the first and third suggestions, for illustration):**
**SUMMARY (Revised):**

I found it interesting to start using MATLAB for more complicated problems. I really liked seeing how much I could do on my own from what I remembered in the videos and what I needed to look back for my notes for.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""Matlab functions for matrix operations"", consider highlighting the specific functions or techniques mentioned in the reflections (e.g., ""array indexing, linear indexing, concatenation, and manipulation"") more prominently at the beginning to immediately focus on the Matlab aspects.
2. **Merge similar sentiments for concision**: Combine the sentiments related to the hands-on experience (enjoying the assignment A05, in-class activity, and working independently) into a single phrase to reduce repetition and allocate more space to Matlab-specific details, e.g., ""Appreciated the interactive learning approach through A05 and the in-class activity, which facilitated independent problem-solving with staff support.""
3. **Quantify the enthusiasm for impact**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantitative or semi-quantitative indicator of the students' enthusiasm for Matlab, e.g., ""Nearly all students expressed enthusiasm for Matlab, with multiple highlighting its matrix operations..."" to immediately convey the widespread interest in Matlab. 

**Revised Summary (under 100 words) incorporating these suggestions:**

1. **Specify the nature of the initial confusion**: To enhance the summary's focus on A09, consider adding a brief description of the aspects of user-defined functions (UDFs) that initially confused students (e.g., syntax, application, or conceptually). This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly. 
   *Example adjustment:* ""...many expressed initial confusion, particularly with **the conceptual application of UDFs**, but the in-class instruction...""

2. **Streamline interests to most relevant A09 aspects**: To maintain conciseness, prioritize the most directly A09-related interests. While collaborative problem-solving is mentioned, it's somewhat tangential to the core of A09 (UDFs in MATLAB). Consider omitting or rephrasing to keep the focus sharper.
   *Example adjustment:* Remove ""collaborative problem-solving strategies also being a highlight"" to maintain a tighter focus.

3. **Quantify student responses for added clarity (if feasible)**: If the reflections' volume allows, consider incorporating a brief quantification (e.g., ""A majority of students..."", ""Several students noted..."") to provide a clearer picture of the class's sentiment towards A09. This can enhance the summary's representativeness without adding bulk.

1. **Specify the Source of Confusion for Formula Notation**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief phrase to the summary to indicate that the confusion between `C(n-1+k,n)` and `C(n-1+k, k)` stems from a comparison to a previously taught, similar formula `C(n-1+r, r)`, as mentioned in one of the reflections. This adds depth to understanding the root of the students' perplexity.

   *Example adjustment:* ""...understanding the application of specific combination formulas, particularly the unexpected deviation from the previously introduced `C(n-1+r, r)` format to `C(n-1+k,n)` vs. `C(n-1+k, k)`...""

1. **Specify the types of proofs causing uncertainty**: To enhance focus, consider adding the specific types of proofs that students are uncertain about applying (e.g., ""when to use direct proof vs. contraposition vs. contradiction"") to provide a clearer picture of where students are struggling, rather than the general ""when to apply each type of proof"".
2. **Distinguish between initial and persistent confusion**: To improve conciseness, separate concepts that caused initial confusion but are now understood (e.g., direct proof, contraposition, contradiction) from those that persistently confuse students (e.g., applying proof types, distinguishing arbitrary/non-arbitrary elements). This could streamline the summary to emphasize ongoing challenges.
3. **Group related requests for clarification**: To increase coherence, cluster related student requests, such as ""further explanation of specific proof methods"" to include both ""proof by contradiction"" and ""distinguishing arbitrary vs. non-arbitrary elements"" under a single category (e.g., ""Deeper Explanation of Proof Nuances""), to reduce the summary's list-like feel and highlight the overarching theme of seeking deeper understanding of proof intricacies.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

 I find it interesting that a circuit in resonance can have so much more voltage than if the frequency was just slightly higher or lower because I would expect it to make a negligible difference.

1. **Specify the aspects of in-class problems that were engaging**: While the summary mentions that students found in-class problems engaging, it would be more concise to highlight the specific aspects that contributed to this engagement, such as ""interactive problem-solving"" or ""applying concepts to visualized scenarios"". This adds depth without increasing the word count.

   **Example adjustment**: ""...students found the interactive, application-based nature of in-class problems engaging, particularly...""

2. **Merge similar concepts for brevity**: The summary lists ""graph projections on the board"", ""oscilloscope demonstrations"", and ""phasor visualizations"" as separate points. Merging these into a single concept (e.g., ""visual aids and demonstrations"") can make the summary more concise without losing essential information.

   **Example adjustment**: ""...appreciated the variety of visual aids and demonstrations (including graph projections, oscilloscope, and phasors) which facilitated...""

3. **Focus on the direct impact on understanding In-Class Problems**: While the original summary mentions the positive impact on homework, to keep the focus strictly on In-Class Problems, consider rephrasing or omitting this aspect to maintain the summary's concise nature and topic focus.

   **Example adjustment**: Remove or rephrase ""which were particularly helpful for homework"" to keep the focus on the in-class experience.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found the interactive, application-based nature of in-class problems engaging, particularly the RLC circuit problem at resonance frequency. They appreciated the variety of visual aids and demonstrations (including graph projections, oscilloscope, and phasors) which facilitated comprehension of complex concepts like resonance, impedance, and phase relationships. The hands-on approach, incorporating tools like meters and galvanometers, enhanced clarity and interest in solving these in-class problems."

Students found the lecture on Phasers & Graphs engaging, citing visual aids and demonstrations as key to their understanding. Specifically, they appreciated the graphical representations of phasors, which facilitated problem-solving and made complex concepts more accessible. The relationship between impedance (Z) and resistance (R), particularly at resonance (where Z=R and X_L=X_C), was a notable point of interest. Additionally, observing how phase angles affect current leading or lagging EMF, and visualizing sinusoidal waves and their changes with circuit modifications, were highlighted as particularly insightful aspects of the lecture.",Related to Phasers & Graphs,"The graphs
