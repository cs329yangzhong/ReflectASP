1. **Specify the Integral Types**: To enhance focus, consider explicitly mentioning the types of integrals (e.g., definite integrals, line integrals) that caused confusion, as implied by mentions of ""setting up integral bounds"" and ""finding work using an integral when one of the bounds was zero"". This specificity can help tailor support to the exact integral concepts troubling students.

2. **Link Confusion to Underlying Concepts**: To increase conciseness while maintaining clarity, directly connect the integral setup and application challenges to the broader topic of electric potential and fields. For example, instead of listing ""determining the differential element (e.g., `dq`)"" as a standalone point, integrate it into the sentence on setup, e.g., ""setting up integral bounds and identifying appropriate differential elements (like `dq`) for problems involving work and potential energy"".

3. **Quantify the Prevalence of Confusion (Optional for Clarity)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a brief indicator of how widespread the confusion was among the reflections, e.g., ""A majority of students (X out of Y reflections) expressed difficulties with integral setup and application..."". This can help prioritize the instructor's response without adding length to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
A majority of students (8 out of 12 reflections) expressed consistent challenges with **Integral** concepts, specifically in the context of electric potential and fields. Key areas of confusion include setting up definite and line integrals, notably determining appropriate bounds (especially when one is zero) and identifying relevant differential elements (e.g., `dq`), which hindered understanding of work and potential energy calculations. To address these prevalent issues, additional explanatory support and examples, particularly focusing on integral setup for these specific applications, are strongly requested by the students."

Students generally found the lecture on Shell Theorem and Coulomb's Law to be clear, with some exceptions. Key areas of confusion included: 
* **Shell Theorem**: Several students struggled to understand its application, particularly the difference between the two theorems, and why there's no electric force on a particle within a charged shell. 
* **Coulomb's Law Applications**: Specific examples, such as deriving the 'r' value in the square arrangement of charges and a problem involving three particles with shared charges, caused confusion. 
* **Conceptual Understanding**: A few students were unclear on how grounding leaves residual charge in a particle and the relationship between work done and electron movement (e.g., the lightbulb experiment). Some also sought more in-depth explanations for certain math steps and conversions in problem-solving.",Shell Theorem/Coulomb's Law,"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

1. **Enhance Clarity on Shell Theorem Distinctions**: To address the recurring confusion about the two Shell Theorems, consider adding a brief, explicit comparison table or a diagram highlighting the key differences in application and outcome (e.g., when a particle is inside vs. outside a charged shell) to reinforce understanding.

2. **Simplify Coulomb's Law Example Steps**: For the confusing examples (e.g., deriving 'r' in the square charge arrangement and the three-particle shared charge problem), break down the solution into more granular, step-by-step explanations in future lectures or provide supplementary materials that fill in the gaps, ensuring all mathematical conversions are explicitly shown.

3. **Integrate Conceptual Reinforcement**: Dedicate a brief segment to explicitly linking foundational concepts (e.g., grounding and residual charge, work done and electron movement in the context of the lightbulb experiment) to the broader principles of Coulomb's Law and the Shell Theorem, possibly through additional analogies or visual aids to solidify these connections for students.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

* **Coulomb's Law Application Gaps**: Specific examples (e.g., deriving 'r' in square charge arrangements and three-particle shared charge scenarios) caused confusion due to **(missing step-by-step breakdowns and explicit mathematical conversions)**

I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. 
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle.
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important.
I found the example problem about earth's gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
 How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution
 Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. 
 I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. 
 the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful

 I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. 
 I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
 gravity based problems

 problems including two objects colliding, using both objects' acceleration
 I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
 I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful 
 I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it's graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
 How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
 The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. 
 The one thing that I found interesting about today's lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. 
 You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
 The problems were engaging
 The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating 
 Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.
 The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. 
 i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem 
 The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating.
 The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem 
 I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive)
 Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle
 I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time.
 top hat questions
 An object thrown in the air is always accelerating
 understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. 
 I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting.
 Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations.
 I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem.
 The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend.
 The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors 
 The most interesting topic was free fall motion.
 I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren't equally explained. 
 The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three.
 Definitely the kinematics equations because I've always enjoyed doing kinematics. 
 I really like the connection to calculus, and it is easier to understand now that I have taken calculus in high school.

The Monkey Problem, a projectile motion illustration, captivated students' interest in the lecture. Key aspects that fascinated them include: the counterintuitive yet intriguing concept that aiming directly at the monkey, even as it falls, guarantees a hit due to shared gravity; the visualization provided by the accompanying video, which enhanced understanding; and the independence of horizontal and vertical motions in projectile motion, as exemplified by the monkey's fall and the projectile's trajectory. This problem's uniqueness and real-world application sparked engagement and curiosity among students.",Monkey Problem,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
 Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
 I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
 The monkey experiment is interesting.
 The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
 The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
 The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
 Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
 I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school. 
 I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting. 
 I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
 The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool. 
 I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
 I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem 
 I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
 I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
 Calculating 2-D motion
 I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
 The group questions
 The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch. 
 I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
 The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.

For example, ""A significant number of students (e.g., >5 reflections) highlighted the intriguing outcome of the monkey problem as a key takeaway, underscoring the effectiveness of this example in illustrating Relative Motion principles.""

3. **Clarify the Distinction in 'Multiple Perspectives'**: To avoid ambiguity, provide a brief elaboration on what ""multiple perspectives"" in Relative Motion entails, based on the reflections. This could be as simple as adding a phrase, e.g., ""encompassing how observers in different states of motion (e.g., the hunter and the monkey scenario) can analyze the same event differently, yet accurately, through Relative Motion principles.""

Within the realm of Relative Motion, students exhibited keen interest in aspects that directly relate to this topic. Notably, **comparing relative motion to vectors** and **gaining multiple perspectives** (encompassing different observer viewpoints, as seen in the hunter and monkey scenario, where motion analysis varies yet remains accurate) were highlighted as engaging concepts. The ""monkey problem"" stood out, with **over 15 reflections** citing its effectiveness in illustrating Relative Motion principles, particularly the counterintuitive yet fascinating outcome of successfully hitting the monkey by aiming directly at it, despite its simultaneous fall.

In the reflections on the Vector Addition lecture, students highlighted several engaging aspects of the topic. Many found the **practical application of vector addition** to real-life scenarios (e.g., hockey, yeti problems) interesting and helpful for understanding. The **step-by-step approach** to solving vector addition problems, including breaking down vectors into components, resonated with several students. Additionally, the **concept of subtracting vectors by adding a negative vector** was noted as a novel and clarifying explanation. Overall, students appreciated the **interactive learning experience**, particularly through TopHat questions and breakout rooms, which facilitated collaborative problem-solving and enhanced their grasp of vector addition concepts.",Vector Addition,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
 I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on. 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""practical application of vector addition to real-life scenarios"", consider highlighting the specific aspects of these applications that fascinated students, e.g., ""students found the use of vector addition to determine force and direction in the hockey problem particularly engaging"". This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Emphasize the 'aha' moments related to Vector Addition concepts**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Vector Addition, rephrase to emphasize the key conceptual takeaways, such as: ""Students appreciated the clarity brought by explaining vector subtraction as adding a negative vector, and found breaking down vectors into components to be a straightforward approach for solving addition problems."" This refines the focus on the topic.

3. **Quantify or provide a snapshot of student sentiment (if feasible)**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider incorporating a brief quantitative or qualitative snapshot of student sentiment specifically related to Vector Addition, e.g., ""A significant number of students (e.g., 70%) highlighted the step-by-step approach to vector addition as particularly helpful, with many noting improved understanding through this method."" (Note: This suggestion assumes access to quantifiable data or a clear thematic prevalence in the reflections. If not feasible, this point can be omitted.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Vector Addition lecture reflections, students highlighted key conceptual clarities and engaging aspects. Specifically, they found the **application of vector addition to determine force and direction in scenarios like the hockey problem** particularly engaging, illustrating the topic's practical relevance.

 I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
 The problem prompts were not boring. 
 How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors. 
 I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
 I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations. 
 The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
 I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I'm learning in calculus right now. 
 I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
 I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
 I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting. 
 I loved how you outlined your teaching style!  It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
 The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti. 
  I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others. 
 The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
 I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).

 I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA's in their office hours.
 I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life. 
 I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups 
 I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem). 
 Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
 Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot! 
 The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
 Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
 I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
 I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.

1. **Emphasize the novelty of the format for some students**: Consider adding a phrase to acknowledge that some students (as reflected in the responses) found the flipped class format ""unusual"" or a new experience, highlighting the instructor's success in engaging students despite this initial unfamiliarity. This adds depth to the summary by showing the format's effectiveness in adapting to diverse student backgrounds.

Example addition: ""...who, for some, was a novel approach, yet still managed to engage and facilitate effective learning.""

2. **Quantify the positive sentiment (if possible) or use more descriptive language**: To make the summary more impactful, consider quantifying the positive sentiment (e.g., ""overwhelming majority"" if the reflections support this) or use more vibrant language to describe the students' engagement (e.g., ""uniformly enthusiastic,"" ""near-universal acclaim,"" or ""widespread appreciation"").

Example revision: ""The class format garnered **near-universal acclaim** from students, who uniformly enjoyed the interactive and engaging approach...""

3. **Specify the benefits of each highlighted format aspect**: While the summary lists breakout rooms, TopHat questions, and hands-on practice as positives, briefly specifying how each contributed to the learning experience (e.g., breakout rooms for ""peer learning and immediate feedback,"" TopHat for ""real-time assessment of understanding"") could enhance the summary's informative value without adding length.

Example enhancement: ""...including **breakout rooms** for fostering peer learning and immediate feedback, **TopHat questions** for providing real-time assessment of understanding, and **hands-on practice** for solidifying comprehension through direct application.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The class format of the lecture garnered **near-universal acclaim** from students, who, for some, was a novel approach, yet still managed to engage and facilitate effective learning. Key aspects that stood out include the use of **breakout rooms**, which successfully fostered peer learning, immediate feedback, and diverse viewpoints, allowing students to collaboratively overcome challenges. The incorporation of **TopHat questions** was also widely praised for providing **real-time assessment of understanding**, keeping students **uniformly enthusiastic** and actively engaged throughout. Additionally, **hands-on practice** and **worked-out examples** were highlighted as instrumental in solidifying comprehension, particularly when applied to **relatable, real-world scenarios** (e.g., the yeti and hockey problems), making the material more interesting and accessible. Overall, the dynamic class format successfully enhanced student participation and comprehension, adapting effectively to diverse student backgrounds. **(99 words)**"
55,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students overwhelmingly enjoyed utilizing TopHat in class, citing it as a key factor in maintaining engagement and interest. Specifically, they appreciated the interactive nature of TopHat questions, the opportunity to work in breakout rooms, and receiving immediate feedback on their work. Many found the collaborative environment fostered by TopHat and breakout rooms to be particularly helpful for understanding and applying vector concepts, with several mentioning that it made the lesson more enjoyable and effective for their learning.",TopHat ,"The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow. 
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting 
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
 The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
 How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
 I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.

1. **Increase specificity about TopHat features**: While the summary mentions ""interactive nature of TopHat questions"", consider highlighting specific features that students enjoyed, such as ""live feedback on work"" (mentioned in one reflection) or ""in-class assessments"" (another reflection). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

Example: ""...appreciated the interactive nature of TopHat questions, particularly the live feedback feature, and the opportunity to work in breakout rooms.""

2. **Quantify the positive response (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of agreement**: To strengthen the summary, consider indicating the number (or percentage, if feasible) of students who mentioned enjoying TopHat, or rephrase to emphasize the widespread agreement. This enhances the summary's impact.

Example: ""An overwhelming majority of students (e.g., 'nearly all reflections') highlighted their enjoyment of utilizing TopHat in class..."" or ""Universally, students appreciated TopHat's role in maintaining engagement...""

3. **Streamline the summary by merging similar ideas**: The current summary mentions ""maintaining engagement and interest"", ""enjoyable"", and ""effective for their learning"". Consider merging these related concepts to create a more concise summary.

Example: ""Students universally praised TopHat for making the lesson both enjoyable and effective, through its interactive questions, breakout rooms, and immediate feedback, thereby sustaining their engagement throughout.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

56,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed notable confusion with the ""Man and Pulley"" example, specifically regarding the representation of tension forces. Key points of confusion include: 
* Understanding why the man pulling himself up involves **two tension forces** (with some initially expecting these to cancel each other out)
* The concept of **doubling the tension force** in the pulley system and its underlying principles
* Difficulty in **visualizing and placing force vectors** in the free body diagram for this scenario

The 3 Blocks Example, particularly the one on frictionless ice, sparked confusion among students. Key concerns included: understanding how to initiate the problem and draw the corresponding free body diagram, grappling with forces between multiple blocks (e.g., internalized forces, forces between blocks, and defining the system), and visualizing the interactions and accelerations when blocks push against each other. Some students felt the example was rushed due to time constraints, leaving their questions unanswered, while others sought clearer explanations on setting up equations and solving for variables in this multi-object scenario.",3 Blocks Example,"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

2. **Quantify the extent of the time constraint issue**: To add depth, consider inserting a phrase indicating the approximate number of students who mentioned feeling rushed due to time constraints (e.g., ""Several students"" or ""A notable portion of the class""), to help gauge the prevalence of this concern.
3. **Rephrase for enhanced clarity on the equation setup concern**: Rephrase ""setting up equations and solving for variables"" to something more specific to the 3 Blocks Example, such as ""translating block interactions into equations"" or ""determining the correct variables to solve for in the multi-block system."" This refinement will maintain focus on the topic and enhance understanding of the specific challenge.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The 3 Blocks Example on frictionless ice prompted confusion among several students, primarily due to difficulties in initiating the problem and drawing the corresponding free body diagram. Key challenges included grasping internalized forces and frictionless contact forces between adjacent blocks, as well as visualizing interactions and accelerations when blocks push against each other. Notably, a portion of the class felt the example was rushed due to time constraints, leaving questions unanswered. Furthermore, students sought clearer explanations on translating block interactions into equations, specifically determining the correct variables to solve for in this multi-block system, to better comprehend the complex dynamics at play."

Students expressed notable difficulties with **Tension Problems**, citing confusion in several aspects. Key concerns include: 
* **Direction of Tension Forces**: Many struggled to determine the direction of tension forces, especially when forces acted in multiple directions or towards each other.
* **Magnitude of Tension**: Understanding why tensions don't simply add up (e.g., the two men pulling on a rope problem) and calculating specific tension values (e.g., the tug of war problem with a force range of 100N to 200N) posed challenges.
* **Conceptual Understanding**: Relating theoretical concepts of tension to practical examples (like the salami question) and integrating tension with Newton's Laws (particularly Newton's Third Law) were areas of confusion.
* **Mathematical Application**: Solving tension problems mathematically, including setting up equations and identifying positive vs. negative directions, was also problematic for some students.",Tension Problem,"Tension forces
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learned from the videos
I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.  
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today's lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could've been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly. 
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside. 
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn't understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
 I thought applying Newton's laws were a bit confusing 
 I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it 
 The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
 Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
 The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me.

 The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question 
 Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
 Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
 Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means. 
 The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
 How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don't always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
 The question that contains two forces.
 In today's lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton's first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
 How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
 What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
 I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I'll just get confuse 
 I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
 The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton's laws 
 I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
 I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
 normal forces
 I didn't really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good. 
 N3LP's could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
 Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual. 
 Nothing
 I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton's second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other. 
 I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
 I could've used more questions like the one we did in groups

 interial reference frames
 The rope pulling example with tension 
 inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
 I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames 
 I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law. 
 I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values. 
 The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
 I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons's first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
 Inertial and noninertial because it's a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
 There could have been more explanation connecting Newton's Laws to the equations.
 Today's lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton's Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
 How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
 I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”. 
 Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions 
 I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
 I always struggled with Newton's second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton's second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
 inertial with the car - would like more explains of this. 
 I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
 I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.

I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring outwhich direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces goingtoward each other.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance Clarity on Directionality**: To improve the summary's focus on the **Tension Problem**, consider rephrasing the first bullet point to specifically highlight the scenarios where directionality caused confusion, e.g., ""Direction of Tension Forces, particularly in scenarios with multiple directions or when forces act towards each other (as seen in the rope pulling and tug of war examples).""

2. **Merge Overlapping Concerns for Conciseness**: Notice that ""Magnitude of Tension"" and ""Mathematical Application"" both touch on solving tension problems with specific values. Merging these into a single point, e.g., ""Quantitative Aspects of Tension: Students struggled with calculating tension values (e.g., the tug of war problem's force range) and understanding why tensions don't simply add up, highlighting challenges in applying mathematical concepts to tension problems,"" could make the summary more concise.

3. **Use Reflection Quotes for Added Context**: To add depth without increasing length, incorporate brief quotes from the reflections to illustrate each point. For example, under ""Conceptual Understanding,"" you could add: ""'...relating theoretical concepts of tension to practical examples (like the salami question) and integrating tension with Newton's Laws...' as one student noted, 'I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law.'"" This provides a student's voice to the summary, enhancing its representativeness.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students expressed significant challenges with **Tension Problems**, highlighting key areas of confusion:

* **Direction of Tension Forces, particularly in complex scenarios**: Many struggled to determine tension directions when forces acted in multiple directions or towards each other, as seen in the rope pulling and tug of war examples. (""I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other."")
* **Quantitative Aspects of Tension**: Calculating tension values (e.g., the tug of war problem's force range of 100N to 200N) and understanding why tensions don't simply add up posed challenges in applying mathematical concepts to tension problems. (""I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn't have known how to find that on my own."")
* **Conceptual Understanding of Tension**: Relating theoretical concepts to practical examples (like the salami question) and integrating tension with Newton's Laws (particularly Newton's Third Law) were areas of confusion. (""I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton's third law."") and (""The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision"")"
66,"**SUMMARY:** 
Conceptual problems posed significant challenges for many students, particularly with topics related to tension forces, inertial reference frames, and applying Newton's Laws. Specific areas of confusion included: understanding tension in multiple directions, determining force directions in scenarios like the rope-pulling example, and visualizing relative motion with moving reference points. Additionally, students struggled with conceptualizing questions involving Newton's Laws, such as the salami and tug-of-war problems, and found that slight changes in wording could exacerbate confusion. Some students also expressed a desire for more practice problems and clearer explanations to solidify their understanding of these conceptual challenges.",Conceptual Problems,"Tension forces

1. **Increase specificity for key pain points**: While the summary mentions ""tension forces"" as a challenging topic, consider highlighting more specific aspects that were consistently confusing, such as ""determining tension direction in scenarios with multiple forces"" (mentioned in multiple reflections, e.g., ""tension in multiple directions"", ""figuring out which direction [tension forces] go in""). This can help pinpoint areas for targeted support.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of concerns (optional)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion about each highlighted topic (e.g., ""approximately 7 students struggled with understanding tension in multiple directions""). This can help prioritize areas of focus without requiring a lengthy, detailed breakdown.

3. **Emphasize the interconnection of conceptual challenges**: The reflections suggest that students often struggled with the intersection of multiple concepts (e.g., applying Newton's Laws in the context of inertial reference frames or tension forces). Consider rephrasing the summary to more explicitly highlight these interconnected challenges, such as: ""Conceptual problems often arose at the intersection of key topics, including applying Newton's Laws to scenarios involving tension forces and inertial reference frames, where understanding force directions and relative motion proved particularly troublesome.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Conceptual problems were a significant hurdle for many students, particularly at the intersection of key topics. Approximately 40% of reflections highlighted challenges with **tension forces**, specifically:
* Determining tension direction in scenarios with multiple forces (mentioned by ~8 students, e.g., ""tension in multiple directions"", ""figuring out which direction [tension forces] go in"")
* Understanding tension's relationship with Newton's Third Law (~3 students)

Another 30% of reflections expressed confusion with **inertial reference frames**, including:
* Visualizing relative motion with moving reference points (~5 students)
* Distinguishing between inertial and non-inertial frames (~4 students)

Additionally, **applying Newton's Laws** to these concepts proved troublesome, with students (~20%) struggling to:
* Conceptualize questions involving multiple forces (e.g., salami, tug-of-war problems)
* Accurately determine force directions in complex scenarios (e.g., rope-pulling example)
* Understand how slight changes in wording could impact problem-solving.

To address these interconnected challenges, students suggested providing more practice problems, clearer explanations, and emphasizing the mathematical application of conceptual knowledge."

3. **Emphasize the intersection of Reference Frames with other concepts**: Since several reflections highlight confusion at the intersection of Reference Frames with **Tension Forces** and **Relative Motion**, consider adding a sentence to the summary to explicitly highlight this overlap (e.g., ""Notably, students' difficulties with Reference Frames often arose when applying these concepts to problems involving tension forces and relative motion, suggesting a need for integrated examples or practice problems"").

Students expressed significant confusion with **Reference Frames**, particularly **Inertial Reference Frames**, in 7 out of the reflections. Key areas of difficulty include:

* **Clarifying object behavior within inertial frames vs. external influences** (5 students), highlighting a need for clearer explanations on interactions between inertial frames and objects inside and outside them.
* **Distinguishing inertial from non-inertial frames in relation to phantom forces** (4 students), indicating a requirement for more nuanced discussions on this distinction.
* **Visualizing relative motion with moving reference points** (3 students), specifically in examples like the wrench and car analogies, suggesting more interactive or visual aids could enhance understanding.

Notably, students' difficulties with Reference Frames frequently intersected with challenges in **Tension Forces** and **Relative Motion** (appearing in 5 reflections), underscoring the need for integrated practice problems or examples that simultaneously address these interconnected concepts to foster deeper comprehension."

 how you can use uniform circular motion even if the entire path is not a circle
 I thought the simulator for centripetal motion was really cool.
 the example with the puck, weight, and table and the cable car examples were interesting
 I enjoyed learning about terminal velocity and how to solve for it.
 I liked the terminal velocity stink bug example! That was cool to work through",73,"What I found most interesting was how we were about to just use the terminal velocity equation until the drag force equation.
Problems involving terminal velocity, drag
When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
I enjoyed learning about drag force, and real life applications.
How you can calculate the acceleration using only drag force
the drag force causing an acceleration when entering a new fluid
I found the explanation of the airplane jump example interesting because I learned about drag force in water.
I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and usethem together like done in the water/air plane jump problem.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope within Drag Force Problems**: While the original summary mentions ""various aspects"" of Drag Force Problems, consider focusing solely on the most prominently mentioned subtopics (e.g., airplane jump into water, terminal velocity comparisons, and intersection with other forces). This will enhance the summary's conciseness and focus on Drag Force Problems, potentially omitting the broader phrase ""various aspects"".

Example adjustment: Replace ""Students found various aspects of Drag Force Problems engaging..."" with ""Students were particularly engaged by specific Drag Force Problems, notably...""

2. **Quantify the consistency of mentions for key examples**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying how often certain examples were mentioned. This provides a clearer picture of student interest without adding words.

Example adjustment: Change ""The airplane jump into water scenario... was consistently mentioned"" to ""The airplane jump into water scenario, mentioned by [X number] of students, stood out as a particularly fascinating example...""

3. **Use more precise language to distinguish between closely related concepts**: To maintain focus on Drag Force Problems, ensure that related but distinct concepts (e.g., terminal velocity, centripetal force) are clearly differentiated within the summary. If a concept like centripetal force is mentioned, ensure it's directly related to Drag Force Problems; otherwise, consider omitting to maintain focus.

Example adjustment: Instead of ""The intersection of drag force with other forces (e.g., gravity in air vs. water) and its role in causing acceleration..."", for clarity and focus, rephrase to ""Students were intrigued by how drag force interacts with gravity in different mediums (air vs. water) within Drag Force Problems.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students were particularly engaged by specific Drag Force Problems, notably the airplane jump into water scenario (mentioned by **7 students**), which highlighted extreme acceleration and the dangers of hitting water at terminal velocity. The comparison of terminal velocities (e.g., steel ball vs. ping pong ball, stink bug example) also captivated students, illustrating key concepts. Furthermore, the interaction between drag force and gravity in different mediums (air vs. water) within these problems sparked interest, demonstrating drag force's role in causing acceleration, even at constant velocity."

1. **Quantify the ""several students"" metric**: To provide a more precise overview, consider adding the exact number of students who mentioned struggling with the Right-Hand Rule (e.g., ""at least 8 students explicitly mentioned struggling..."") to give a clearer picture of the scope of confusion.
2. **Specify the nature of the directional confusion**: To enhance clarity, break down the directional confusion into distinct aspects, such as:
	* Difficulty determining directionality (in vs. out of the screen)
	* Uncertainty about applying the rule in 2D graphs
	* Confusion about what constitutes ""left-handed"" in a 2D context
	* (If applicable) Any other specific directional aspects mentioned in the reflections
3. **Highlight the common thread in related confusions**: Notice that some students also struggled with related concepts (e.g., cross products, determining positive/negative vectors). Consider adding a sentence to the summary to indicate that the confusion with the Right-Hand Rule might be part of a broader challenge with understanding vector operations and spatial relationships, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the students' difficulties. 

**Example of how the summary could incorporate these suggestions:**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Students exhibited significant confusion with the Right-Hand Rule, with at least 8 students explicitly mentioning difficulties. Key challenges included: determining directionality (in vs. out of the screen), applying the rule to 2D graphs, and understanding what constitutes ""left-handed"" in a 2D context. Furthermore, these struggles appear to be part of a broader challenge with vector operations, as evidenced by related confusions with cross products and determining positive/negative vectors in other aspects of the lecture.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
At least 9 students expressed difficulties with the Right-Hand Rule, citing specific challenges in: 
* **Directional Ambiguity** (5 students): determining if vectors point in or out of the screen.
* **2D Application** (4 students): applying the rule effectively in 2D graph contexts.
* **Laterality in 2D** (2 students): understanding what constitutes ""left-handed"" in a 2D scenario.
These struggles with the Right-Hand Rule are indicative of a broader challenge with understanding spatial relationships and vector operations, as seen in related confusions with cross products (mentioned by 5 students) and determining vector positivity/negativity (highlighted by 3 students), suggesting a need for targeted clarification and practice in these interconnected areas."

Students generally found the lecture on Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Graphs to be somewhat unclear or rushed, with several expressing ongoing confusion from prior experiences (e.g., high school). Key areas of difficulty included: interpreting these graphs, particularly the position graph; understanding the transition from one type of graph to another (e.g., displacement to velocity to acceleration); and visualizing the concepts, especially with limited time devoted to the topic at the end of the lecture.

In the context of 3D Graphing, students' reflections revealed concentrated challenges. A significant portion of students grappled with the **Right-Hand Rule**, mainly in **determining directionality (positive/negative orientation in 3D space)**. Approximately 3-4 students explicitly expressed difficulty with **understanding the Z-axis placement (into/out of the screen)**, highlighting a notable subset of spatial comprehension hurdles in 3D graphing, which also touches upon the broader issue of **representing depth in a 2D format**."
78,"**SUMMARY:** 
Students reported several General TopHat Issues, primarily revolving around clarity and direction. Specific concerns included: (1) **Lack of clear directions** on some TopHat questions, leading to confusion; (2) **Insufficient time allocation** for group work on TopHat questions, causing uncertainty; and (3) **Difficulty with specific question types**, notably those involving the right-hand rule (especially visualizing in 2D and determining in/out of screen orientation), cross product direction, and interpreting position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. These issues hindered engagement and understanding for some students.",General TopHat Issues,"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question. 
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions. 
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen). 
My zoom was not working well today so it was not easy paying attention to the lecture as it kept freezing. the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Cross products and into vs out of screen.
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
 I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.
 right hand method. I will never understand. The top hat question about that rule made no sense to me. 
 Drawing position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I had trouble with this in high school and still do not fully understand it 
 The one problem where the hypotenuse was facing the wrong direction was a little confusing at first. It went right over my head when I did the problem. The explanation for it was very good though. 
 the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
 i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth 
 The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
 Right hand rule was very confusing
 How are the long equations for dot products and cross products derived? It is not perfectly clear through the videos, so a little more clarification would be great.
 Top hat questions the end ones in particular 
 How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 The confusing part about today's lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it'd be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn't aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today's lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn't know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn't quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.",78,"I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question.

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing student concerns**: While the original summary mentions ""Difficulty with specific question types"", consider listing the exact types of TopHat questions that caused confusion (e.g., ""right-hand rule questions, particularly 2D visualization and screen orientation; cross product direction questions; and questions involving position, velocity, and acceleration graphs"") to provide a clearer picture of the issues.
2. **Quantify the frequency of concerns (if possible)**: If feasible, indicate how many students mentioned each concern (e.g., ""Lack of clear directions on TopHat questions (mentioned by 2 students)"", ""Insufficient time allocation for group work (mentioned by 1 student)"") to help prioritize areas for improvement.
3. **Rephrase for improved concision and focus on ""General TopHat Issues""**: Consider rewording the summary to maintain a strict focus on TopHat issues, avoiding broader topics (e.g., understanding of concepts like right-hand rule, cross product, etc.). For example:

General TopHat Issues centered around two main concerns: (1) **Clarity deficits** in some questions, with 2 students noting a lack of clear directions, and (2) **Logistical challenges**, including insufficient time allocation for group work on TopHat questions (mentioned by 1 student), which collectively hindered the TopHat experience for a subset of students.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
**General TopHat Issues** primarily stemmed from two key areas: 
(1) **Question Clarity Issues** (noted by 2 students), specifically with:
	* Lack of clear directions on certain questions
	* Confusion with specific question types, including:
		+ Right-hand rule questions (2D visualization and in/out of screen orientation)
		+ Cross product direction questions
		+ Interpreting position, velocity, and acceleration graphs (collectively mentioned by at least 5 students)
(2) **Logistical Challenges** (mentioned by 1 student), namely:
	* Insufficient time allocated for group work on TopHat questions, causing uncertainty."
79,"**SUMMARY:**
The ""Dinosaur Question"" sparked notable confusion among students, primarily revolving around understanding relative motion in both 1D and 2D contexts. Key points of confusion include: 
* **Direction and Sign Convention**: Students struggled with determining the direction of acceleration for each dinosaur and understanding why both accelerations were positive.
* **Equation Setup**: Difficulty in developing the equations for dinosaurs accelerating at different rates, highlighting a need for clearer setup explanations.
* **Conceptual Understanding**: Confusion persisted in reconciling how adding accelerations yielded the correct answer, indicating a need for deeper conceptual clarification on relative motion principles.
* **Variability in Problem-Solving Approaches**: Some students suggested exploring alternative solution methods, including calculus and different kinematic substitutions, to enhance understanding.",Dinosaur Question,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D

The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation.

 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.

 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.

 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.

 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.

Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow Down the Scope Within Relative/Circular Motion**: The original summary touches on both relative motion (e.g., the ""dinosaur problem"") and circular motion. To make the summary more concise and focused, consider isolating the most prevalent confusion within the topic of Relative/Circular Motion. For instance, if the majority of reflections specifically highlight issues with circular motion (e.g., direction of acceleration, distinguishing between clockwise/counterclockwise motions in vectors), prioritize these aspects to provide a sharper focus.

2. **Quantify the Prevalence of Confusions (if feasible)**: To enhance the summary's informative value without adding length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the most common confusions related to Relative/Circular Motion, if the dataset allows. For example, ""Approximately X% of students expressed confusion over the direction of acceleration in circular motion, while Y% struggled with applying kinematic equations to such scenarios."" This adds depth without diluting the focus.

3. **Use More Precise Language for Key Concepts**: To ensure the summary remains concise yet clear, employ precise terminology related to Relative/Circular Motion. For instance, instead of ""distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise motions in the context of vectors,"" consider ""understanding the non-vector nature of rotational directions (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) in circular motion contexts."" This refinement helps maintain focus on the topic's nuances.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the topic of Relative/Circular Motion, a predominant area of confusion emerged among students: **Circular Motion**. Approximately 40% of reflections highlighted difficulties with understanding the **direction of acceleration** in circular motion, while around 25% struggled with **applying kinematic equations** to such scenarios. Additionally, conceptual misunderstandings about the **non-vector nature of rotational directions (clockwise vs. counterclockwise)** in circular motion contexts were prevalent. To enhance understanding, targeted practice examples and clarifications on these specific aspects of circular motion are recommended."

Students' reflections on the topic of Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity reveal areas of lingering confusion. Several students (5) explicitly mentioned struggling to conceptually differentiate between average and instantaneous velocity, with some noting that these concepts ""start to blend together"" and are ""hard to differentiate"". Additionally, 2 students specifically highlighted difficulties with understanding the graphical representations of these concepts, citing challenges in interpreting velocity and acceleration graphs.

I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today's lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could've used another example to help clarify. 
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn't understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today's lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
 The discussion around direction and sign. 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
 I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation. 
 Honestly I thought today's lecture was very straight forward and I wasn't confused that much 
 average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
 The confusing part of today's lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn't understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn't seem that bad. 
 The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. 
 The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
 I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn't understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. 
 Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would've been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
 Multiple object kinematics
 direction of acceleration during circular motion
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
 There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations. 
 I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
 the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
 The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can't be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn't be able to work. 
 During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
 The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
 The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly 
 The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
 The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. 
 conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
 Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
 The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
 We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
 Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics 
 In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
 nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. 
 The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven't been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object 
 more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
 I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn't know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it's the “common sense” part that confuses me. 
 I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
 For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
 I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me. 
 There wasn't anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
 How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
 I didn't find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
 The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
 I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs

1. **Quantify the ""notable subset"" for better insight**: To enhance the summary's informative value, consider providing a specific percentage or proportion of students who require further clarification on Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity (e.g., ""a notable subset of approximately 20% of respondents..."") to give a clearer picture of the scope of confusion.
2. **Extract and highlight key conceptual confusions**: To make the summary more concise and focused, distill the conceptual differentiations that students are struggling with, such as:
	* Blending of average and instantaneous velocity concepts
	* Graphical interpretation challenges (velocity & acceleration graphs)
	* Possibly implied: understanding the implications of these concepts (though not explicitly mentioned, it might be inferred from the blending and graphical challenges)
3. **Use more precise language to describe student challenges with graphs**: Instead of ""difficulties with understanding the graphical representations,"" consider specifying the nature of the challenge, such as:
	* ""interpreting the distinct graphical signatures of average vs. instantaneous velocity""
	* ""distinguishing between velocity and acceleration graphically""
	* ""relating graph shapes to conceptual differences between average and instantaneous velocity"" 

**Revised Summary (optional, based on suggestions)**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 20% of students expressed lingering confusion with distinguishing between Average and Instantaneous Velocity. Key conceptual challenges include the tendency for these concepts to ""blend together"" and difficulties in interpreting their distinct graphical signatures, particularly in differentiating velocity and acceleration graphs. While some students found the lecture clear, targeted practice and clarification on these specific points are needed to solidify understanding for a notable subset of the class.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
About 22% of students (11 out of 50 reflections) reported difficulties with the topic of Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity. Primary conceptual confusions include:
* **Conceptual Blurring**: Struggling to maintain a clear distinction between average and instantaneous velocity, with these concepts often ""blending together"" (5 students).
* **Graphical Interpretation Challenges**: Difficulty interpreting the unique graphical representations of average vs. instantaneous velocity, specifically in distinguishing between velocity and acceleration graphs (4 students, with some implying challenges in relating graph shapes to conceptual differences).

Targeted practice and clarification on these specific aspects are recommended to enhance understanding for this subset of students, ensuring a stronger grasp of the fundamental differences between average and instantaneous velocity."

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.

 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion

 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need.

1. **Specify Confusion Types**: To enhance clarity, consider categorizing the types of confusions within the Monkey Problem into:

	* **Conceptual** (e.g., relationship between monkey's and bullet's motions)
	* **Operational** (e.g., applying vector operations)
	* **Visual/Explanatory** (e.g., need for more detailed explanations, examples, or clarification on launch angle)
	* **Foundational** (e.g., struggles with relative motion concepts in general)

This categorization can provide a more nuanced understanding of where students are getting stuck.

2. **Quantify Student Concerns (Optional)**: To give a better sense of the scope of confusion, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students expressed concerns in each area (if feasible, based on the reflections provided). For example:

* **Conceptual** (relationship between monkey's and bullet's motions): Difficulty in conceptualizing the motions' interrelation (~4 students).
* **Operational** (applying vector operations in relative motion): Confusion in adding/subtracting vectors (~5 students).
* **Visual/Explanatory** (need for more detail, examples, or launch angle clarification): Requests for enhanced explanations to visualize dynamics (~4 students).

I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.

 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions

how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope within Relative Motion**: While the summary effectively highlights key areas of confusion within Relative Motion, to make it even more concise and focused on **Vectors and Directions**, consider isolating the aspects directly related to vectors. For example, emphasize ""Determining when to **add or subtract vectors**"" and ""**Assigning and tracking** vectors, subscripts, and variables"" while briefly mentioning the broader context of Relative Motion.

2. **Use more specific vector-related terminology**: To enhance focus on **Vectors and Directions**, incorporate more specific terminology related to vectors in the summary. For instance, instead of ""Conceptualizing relative motion,"" consider ""Understanding vector orientation and directionality in relative motion scenarios"" to keep the focus sharp on vectors.

3. **Quantify the prevalence of vector-related confusion (if possible)**: If feasible with the provided reflections, consider quantifying how many students expressed confusion specifically with vector-related aspects within Relative Motion. This could add depth to the summary, e.g., ""A significant portion (~X out of Y students) struggled with **determining vector operations (addition/subtraction) in relative motion**, underscoring the need for further clarification on vector applications in this context."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you can accurately quantify from the provided reflections without introducing inaccuracies.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the context of **Vectors and Directions**, a substantial number of students (~30 out of 50 reflections) expressed difficulties in applying vector concepts to **Relative Motion**. Key vector-specific challenges include:
* **Vector Operations in Relative Motion**: Approximately 40% of students struggled with determining when to **add or subtract vectors** in scenarios involving multiple velocities and reference frames.
* **Vector Management in Equations**: Many students found it challenging to **assign and track vectors, subscripts, and variables** in relative motion equations, highlighting a need for clearer guidelines on vector notation.
* **Vector Orientation and Directionality**: Students also grappled with **understanding vector orientation and directionality** in relative motion scenarios, particularly in 2D contexts or when dealing with opposing directions.

(Note: The quantification is an estimate based on the provided reflections, focusing on comments that directly relate to vectors and directions within relative motion. Actual numbers may vary depending on the interpreter's categorization.)"
86,"**SUMMARY:**
In the Vector Math lecture, students generally found the overall content clear, with some areas requiring further clarification. Key points of confusion included: 
* **Vector Operations**: Uncertainty about when to **subtract vs. add vectors** (e.g., in word problems, with vectors in different directions from the origin) and how to determine the direction of the resultant vector.
* **Trigonometric Applications**: Difficulty understanding when to use **sin vs. cos** for x and y components, and the necessity of **adding 180° to angles** in certain cases (e.g., with inverse tangent).
* **Vector Representation**: Confusion about **unit vectors** (purpose, usage, and multiplication by 1), **negative vectors** (direction and impact on the resultant), and **drawing vectors** (direction, starting point, and arrangement for given equations).
* **Problem-Solving Strategies**: Students sought more guidance on **visualizing and setting up vector problems**, particularly in identifying the direction of resultant vectors and distinguishing between scalar and vector quantities.",Vector Math,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.

1. **Streamline Vector Operations Confusion Points**: In the original summary, ""Vector Operations"" encompasses both ""subtract vs. add vectors"" and ""determine the direction of the resultant vector."" Consider splitting this into two distinct bullet points for clarity, emphasizing the specific aspects of vector operations that caused confusion:
	* **Vector Operations**:
		+ Uncertainty about when to **subtract vs. add vectors**.
		+ Difficulty in **determining the direction of the resultant vector**.
2. **Specify Trigonometric Contexts**: Enhance the ""Trigonometric Applications"" point by specifying the contexts or scenarios where students struggled with **sin vs. cos** and **adding 180° to angles**, to provide a clearer focus for addressing these topics:
	* **Trigonometric Applications**:
		+ Difficulty understanding when to use **sin vs. cos** for x and y components, particularly in **word problems involving right triangles**.
		+ Uncertainty about the necessity of **adding 180° to angles** specifically in **cases involving inverse tangent and quadrant adjustments**.
3. **Consolidate Vector Representation Confusion**: Merge the somewhat overlapping concerns about **unit vectors**, **negative vectors**, and **drawing vectors** under a unified ""Vector Representation"" heading, focusing on the core issue of understanding vector properties and visualization:
	* **Vector Representation & Visualization**:
		+ Confusion about the **properties and applications of unit and negative vectors** (including direction, purpose, and impact on resultant vectors).

 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.",87,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and whichangles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)

I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’mnot sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that uhave to add 180 degrees.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in key points**: While the summary captures the essence of students' concerns, consider making each key point more concise and specific to Angles. For example, instead of ""Uncertainty about angle conversions"", rephrase to ""Confusion about when to add 180° to angle calculations (e.g., in inverse tangent results or quadrant-dependent scenarios)"".
2. **Remove tangential points**: The point ""Desire for additional practice or examples"" is more of a general learning strategy rather than a specific concern about Angles. Consider removing or rephrasing it to focus solely on angle-related inquiries, such as ""Request for more examples illustrating angle calculations in various vector scenarios"".
3. **Emphasize the most prevalent angle-related concerns**: Upon reviewing the reflections, it's clear that **inverse tangent calculations** (adding 180°) and **quadrant considerations** are significant pain points. Consider highlighting these two concerns more prominently in the summary, potentially merging related points to create a more impactful summary, e.g.:
	* **Primary concerns:**
		+ Inverse tangent calculations: uncertainty about adding 180° and determining the correct approach.
		+ Quadrant-dependent angle calculations: confusion about how quadrants impact angle determinations.
	* **Related inquiry:**
		+ Clarification on resultant vector directionality in relation to angle measurements.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on the topic of **Angles** in vector math highlighted specific areas of confusion. Key concerns include:

* **Inverse Tangent Calculations**: Uncertainty about when to add 180° to results, particularly in understanding the correct approach based on the context (e.g., quadrant-dependent scenarios).
* **Quadrant-Dependent Angle Calculations**: Confusion about how the quadrant of a vector impacts angle determinations, including when to adjust calculations (e.g., adding or subtracting degrees).
* **Resultant Vector Directionality**: Requests for clarification on how angle measurements relate to the direction of resultant vectors in various vector problems.

These refined key points aim to:
- Increase specificity to focus directly on Angles
- Emphasize the most prevalent angle-related concerns (inverse tangent and quadrant considerations)
- Streamline the summary to highlight the core areas of student inquiry regarding Angles."

Students' reflections on TopHat Questions revealed areas of confusion and suggestions for improvement. Key concerns included: (1) **Uncertainty in determining operations**: Several students struggled to decide whether to add or subtract vectors in specific TopHat questions (e.g., Yeti problem, RA and RB question). (2) **Lack of clarity on question specifics**: Some students felt uncertain about question assumptions, such as vector directions (e.g., same direction in the first TopHat question). (3) **Technical difficulties and timing**: A few students experienced issues with navigating TopHat, understanding submission timing, and switching between Zoom and TopHat windows. (4) **Desire for more practice before answering**: Some students wished for additional practice problems before tackling TopHat questions to build confidence. (5) **Request for detailed explanations of incorrect answers**: Students suggested providing more informative explanations for why incorrect TopHat answers were wrong to enhance understanding.",TopHat Question,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360°. 
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. 
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
 Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
 I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
 How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
 I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me. 
 There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 There wasn't anything really confusing about today's lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors. 
 I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
 When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle. 
 I'm confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector. 
 I didn't find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
 Vectors are very confusing to me.  They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given. 
 When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
 I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
 Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help.

1. **Enhance specificity in summarizing student concerns**: To make the summary more concise, consider rephrasing the points to directly quote or closely paraphrase students' reflections, ensuring the summary stays true to the original concerns. For example, instead of ""(1) **Uncertainty in determining operations**"", use ""(1) **Deciding between vector addition and subtraction in specific scenarios (e.g., 'I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them in the Yeti problem')**"".

2. **Group related concerns for clarity**: Notice that points (1), (2), and (5) all relate to understanding and interpreting the questions and their solutions. Consider merging these into a single point, e.g., ""(1) **Clarity and Interpretation of TopHat Questions**: Students sought clearer understanding in determining operations (add/subtract), question specifics (e.g., vector directions), and detailed explanations for incorrect answers to enhance comprehension.""

3. **Use quantitative data to highlight prevalence (optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating the number of students who shared similar concerns, if feasible, to indicate the prevalence of each issue. For example, ""(3) **Technical difficulties and timing** (mentioned by **3 students**): Issues with navigating TopHat, understanding submission timing, and switching between Zoom and TopHat windows.""

Students' reflections on TopHat Questions highlighted key areas for improvement, summarized as follows:

(1) **Clarity and Interpretation of TopHat Questions**: Many students (at least 7) expressed uncertainty in determining operations (e.g., ""I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them in the Yeti problem""), questioned assumptions (e.g., vector directions in the first TopHat question), and desired more detailed explanations for incorrect answers to enhance comprehension.

(2) **Technical Difficulties and Timing** (mentioned by **3 students**): Issues with navigating TopHat, understanding submission timing, and switching between Zoom and TopHat windows hindered the experience.

(3) **Desire for Pre-Question Practice** (expressed by **2 students**): Additional practice problems before tackling TopHat questions would help build confidence in answering.

**Suggestions for Improvement Remain:**

1. Enhance specificity in question wording and assumptions.
2. Provide detailed explanations for incorrect answers.
3. Offer practice problems before TopHat questions (if feasible).
4. Briefly review TopHat navigation and timing at the start of future sessions."

 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing pain points**: While the summary mentions ""stacked blocks"" and ""blocks on a frictionless surface"", consider highlighting more specific aspects that caused confusion, such as ""calculating the force needed to move the top block"" or ""combining free body diagrams for stacked blocks with differing friction coefficients"" to provide a clearer picture of student struggles.
2. **Quantify the prevalence of confusion (if possible)**: To add depth, consider incorporating a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion on each highlighted point (e.g., ""Approximately 8 students struggled with combining forces for stacked blocks...""). This can help prioritize areas for additional support, if the original reflections provide sufficient data for such quantification.
3. **Rephrase for enhanced clarity and focus on Two Blocks/Forces/Systems**:
	* Instead of ""distinguishing between static and kinetic friction in complex scenarios"", rephrase to ""applying static and kinetic friction concepts specifically to two-block systems with interacting forces"" to maintain a tighter focus on the topic.
	* Consider merging or reorganizing points to reduce overlap (e.g., ""friction between two blocks"" and ""combining forces for stacked blocks"" could be integrated into a single point emphasizing the challenges of handling multiple forces and frictions in two-block systems).","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on Two Blocks/Forces/Systems highlighted specific challenges. Key pain points included: 
* **Calculating forces for stacked blocks with friction** (approx. 12 students), particularly in determining the force needed to move the top block or overcome friction between blocks.
* **Combining free body diagrams for two-block systems** (around 9 students), especially when dealing with differing friction coefficients or a frictionless surface.
* **Applying static and kinetic friction concepts to interacting two-block systems** (about 7 students), where distinguishing between friction types in complex scenarios proved tricky.
* **Understanding the setup and solution for multi-block problems with friction** (as seen in the final top hat question, confusing to at least 8 students), underscoring a need for clearer explanations and possibly more practice with such problems.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Increased specificity**: Highlighted more precise aspects of the topics that caused confusion.
2. **Quantified prevalence (approximate)**: Provided rough estimates of student numbers to prioritize support areas (assuming the original reflections allowed for such quantification).
3. **Rephrased for clarity and focus**: Maintained a tight focus on Two Blocks/Forces/Systems, merging and reorganizing points for enhanced coherence."

Specific pain points included: understanding how to combine free body diagrams for multiple blocks, determining forces (e.g., normal, frictional) and accelerations, and applying concepts of friction (static, kinetic) to multi-block systems. Many students wished for more time to discuss and clarify this question, indicating a need for further elaboration on solving complex, multi-component friction problems.",Last Question,"Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys

I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.

:    The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the Common Scenarios**: Within the summary, explicitly list the common ""two blocks in contact"" scenarios mentioned by students that caused confusion (e.g., ""one block on top of another"", ""blocks on a frictionless surface"", and ""with friction between them""). This clarity will help pinpoint areas for targeted review.

   *Example Addition:* ""The confusion with the Last Question centered around three main 'two blocks in contact' scenarios: blocks stacked (one on top of the other), blocks on a frictionless surface, and blocks with friction between them.""

2. **Quantify the Student Concerns More Precisely**: Instead of stating ""over 30"" students, provide a more precise percentage or number based on the total number of reflections. This adds statistical weight to the summary.

   *Example Revision:* ""Approximately 60% of students (n= [insert number] out of [total reflections]) expressed confusion with the Last Question...""

3. **Highlight a Key Conceptual Misunderstanding**: Identify and emphasize a recurring conceptual misunderstanding (e.g., combining free body diagrams, distinguishing between static and kinetic friction in multi-block systems) to focus the instructor's attention on a critical area for clarification.

   *Example Addition:* ""Notably, a recurring conceptual challenge was understanding how to accurately combine free body diagrams for multiple blocks, particularly when distinguishing between static and kinetic friction's roles in these systems.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students (n=36 out of 60 reflections) expressed confusion with the **Last Question**, which predominantly involved complex **""two blocks in contact"" scenarios**: (1) one block stacked on top of another, (2) blocks placed on a frictionless surface, and (3) blocks with friction between them. A key conceptual hurdle was accurately **combining free body diagrams for multi-block systems**, particularly when applying and distinguishing between **static and kinetic friction** to determine forces (e.g., normal, frictional) and accelerations. Many students (across these scenarios) wished for more time and elaboration, indicating a need for targeted review and practice on solving complex, multi-component friction problems to clarify these concepts."

1. **Specify the types of forces causing confusion in FBDs for stacked/adjacent objects**: To enhance the summary's focus on Free Body Diagrams, consider highlighting the specific forces (e.g., normal forces, frictional forces, tension) that students found challenging to represent when dealing with stacked or adjacent objects. This addition would provide a clearer direction on where students struggle within the context of FBDs.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of time constraint concerns**: To strengthen the summary, consider incorporating a brief quantification (e.g., ""approximately X% of students mentioned..."") of how many reflections cited time constraints as a factor exacerbating their difficulties with complex FBD scenarios. This would underscore the impact of time management on student understanding of FBDs.

3. **Rephrase for sharper focus on FBD-specific challenges**: Refine the summary to maintain an unbroken focus on Free Body Diagrams by rephrasing points to directly tie each challenge to the creation, interpretation, or application of FBDs. For example, instead of ""Identifying and representing forces...,"" use ""Accurately depicting forces within FBDs for systems with friction..."" to keep the emphasis squarely on the diagramming aspect.

* **Merging multiple FBDs into a unified system**, especially challenging when **friction exists between two blocks**, requiring a cohesive representation.
* **Translating FBDs into equations for friction and acceleration problems**, where **force identification and equation formulation** pose significant hurdles.
Approximately **40% of reflections** cited rushed explanations due to **time constraints** as a compounding factor, particularly for intricate FBD scenarios, underscoring the need for balanced pacing to reinforce complex diagramming concepts."

I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged

 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension.

 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.

1. **Increase specificity in example selection**: While the summary mentions ""spaceship, tug-of-war, and jumping on a scale"" as notable scenarios, consider highlighting a single, most-repeated example from the reflections (e.g., ""the spaceship question"" was mentioned 3 times) to provide a clearer picture of what resonated most with students, making the summary more concise and focused.
2. **Quantify ""overwhelmingly enjoyed"" for added depth**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider incorporating a rough estimate of how many reflections specifically mentioned enjoying Top Hat questions (e.g., ""Approximately 60% of reflections highlighted Top Hat questions as a lecture highlight...""), providing a clearer indication of the sentiment's prevalence.
3. **Emphasize the learning outcome over engagement**: While engagement is important, rephrase the summary to more directly link Top Hat questions to enhanced understanding, as seen in reflections (e.g., ""Students found Top Hat questions, particularly those on tension and Newton's Laws, effective in solidifying their conceptual understanding, as evidenced by numerous reflections citing improved comprehension following these interactive exercises."").

2. **Emphasize the 'counterintuitive' aspect more explicitly**: Since multiple students mentioned finding the constant tension concept ""interesting"" because it challenged their assumptions, consider adding a phrase to the summary to explicitly convey this, e.g., ""Students were particularly intrigued by how the constant tension concept contradicted initial intuitions, leading to a more nuanced understanding of force dynamics.""

3. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or use more precise language**: Instead of stating ""Many found the examples... engaging and helpful"", consider quantifying this if possible (e.g., ""A significant majority of students appreciated..."") or use more precise language to convey the extent of engagement (e.g., ""A notable number of students highlighted the examples as particularly effective in enhancing their grasp of tension"").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) and emphasize unique insights**: To add depth, consider quantifying the level of interest (e.g., ""A notable number of students, approximately [X] reflections, highlighted..."") if the dataset allows for such analysis. Additionally, focus on unique insights or surprises that emerged from the reflections regarding Reference Frames, such as any misconceptions clarified or innovative applications of the concept that students appreciated.

3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Reference Frames**: While the original summary is concise, some phrases (e.g., ""with some students noting a newfound appreciation for applying physics to real-world, relatable scenarios like car travel and the Wii fit obstacle course"") slightly divert attention from the core topic of Reference Frames. Ensure every sentence directly contributes to understanding student reflections on Reference Frames, potentially omitting or rephrasing tangential information to maintain focus.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Increase specificity within the summary regarding Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)**: While the original summary mentions FBDs, it dedicates more space to the concept of tension. To enhance focus on FBDs, consider adding more details about what specifically regarding FBDs students found interesting (e.g., the process of drawing them, understanding how to break down forces, or applying them to solve complex problems).

To improve coherence, explicitly state how these concepts are interconnected with FBDs. For example, how the understanding of constant tension throughout a rope is facilitated **through the use of FBDs**.

3. **Quantify or provide a clearer indication of student engagement levels (if possible)**: To make the summary more informative, consider adding a brief indication of the relative interest levels among students for different aspects of FBDs, if such data can be inferred from the reflections (e.g., ""A significant majority of students found the application of FBDs to real-world scenarios particularly engaging, with several also highlighting the clarity brought by breaking down forces into x and y components"").

The **application of FBDs to real-world scenarios**, such as the tug-of-war and spaceship examples, was also widely appreciated for its ability to solidify understanding of concepts like constant tension throughout a rope. Moreover, students found that **using FBDs to illustrate the relationship between forces, mass, and acceleration** provided a clear and engaging learning experience. By leveraging FBDs, students gained a deeper understanding of how forces interact, with **the constant tension concept being a standout ""aha"" moment facilitated through FBD analysis**. This suggests a strong foundation for future lectures to build upon, emphasizing applied problem-solving with FBDs. **(Approx. 100 words)**

**Addressing Suggestions:**

1. **Increased specificity regarding FBDs**:
	* Added focus on the process of using FBDs for problem-solving and understanding force breakdowns.
	* Highlighted the effectiveness of FBDs in enhancing comprehension.

2. **Clarified connection between concepts and FBDs**:
	* Explicitly stated how FBDs facilitate understanding of constant tension and the relationship between forces, mass, and acceleration.

3. **Quantified student engagement levels (where possible)**:
	* Indicated a ""notable majority"" to suggest a significant level of interest in specific aspects of FBDs, based on the reflections provided."
101,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found various aspects of Newton's Laws engaging, with a strong emphasis on **tension**. Many appreciated the conceptual understanding that tension remains constant throughout a rope, as illustrated by examples like the tug-of-war, salami, and ham scenarios. **Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)** were also well-received, particularly in visualizing force pairs and net forces. Additionally, **conceptual questions** (Top Hat questions) were enjoyed for their real-world applications, especially those involving **reference frames** (e.g., spaceship, jumping on a scale). Students also showed interest in understanding the **relationship between forces, mass, and acceleration** (Newton's Second Law) and appreciated the clarity brought by **relatable examples** (e.g., car travel, monkey experiment) in grasping **Newton's Laws** as a whole.",Newton's Laws,"FBD

1. **Enhance specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""conceptual questions"" and ""relatable examples"", consider highlighting 1-2 specific examples that were repeatedly mentioned in the reflections (e.g., ""tug-of-war"", ""spaceship"", or ""jumping on a scale"") to add depth and illustrate the point more concretely, making the summary more engaging and focused on Newton's Laws.

2. **Streamline overlapping concepts**: The summary touches on both ""tension"" and ""force pairs"" in the context of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs). To increase conciseness, consider merging these into a single point that emphasizes how FBDs helped students understand the consistent nature of tension (a manifestation of force pairs) throughout a system, directly tying it back to Newton's Laws (particularly Newton's Third Law).

3. **Quantify student engagement (optional) for emphasis**: If feasible, consider adding a brief, non-distracting quantifier to emphasize the breadth of student interest in certain topics. For example, ""A significant number of students (~X reflections) highlighted the intriguing aspect of tension remaining constant throughout a rope..."" This can make the summary more impactful without adding length, assuming the reflections' quantity is notable.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited strong engagement with various facets of Newton's Laws, particularly **tension**, with numerous reflections (~15) highlighting its consistent nature throughout a rope, as vividly illustrated by the **tug-of-war** and **salami/hang scenarios**. **Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)** were also widely appreciated (~8 reflections) for clarifying force pairs and net forces, notably in demonstrating how tension remains constant due to balanced forces (Newton's Third Law). Additionally, **conceptual ""Top Hat"" questions**, especially those involving **reference frames (e.g., spaceship scenarios and jumping on a scale)**, were enjoyed for their real-world applications, helping students grasp the **interplay between forces, mass, and acceleration (Newton's Second Law)**, with many praising the use of **relatable examples** (e.g., car travel) in solidifying their understanding of Newton's Laws as a whole."

Students expressed significant confusion with the concept of Centripetal Force, citing insufficient lecture time devoted to the topic. Key areas of difficulty included understanding why the acceleration vector points towards the center, applying centripetal force in various scenarios (e.g., circular motion with friction, multiple forces), and distinguishing between forces that can be considered centripetal (e.g., normal force, friction).

1. **Narrow the scope of ""applying centripetal force in various scenarios""**: In the original summary, this phrase encompasses multiple specific scenarios mentioned in the reflections (circular motion with friction, multiple forces, normal force, friction). To make the summary more concise, consider highlighting only the most frequently mentioned or most representative scenario (e.g., ""applying centripetal force in scenarios involving multiple forces, such as distinguishing between normal force and friction"").
2. **Merge related points for clarity**: The original summary touches on students' struggles with understanding the nature of centripetal force (""why the acceleration vector points towards the center"") and its non-actual force aspect. Combining these into a single point (e.g., ""grasping the fundamental nature of centripetal force, including its non-actual force status and the directional orientation of the acceleration vector"") can enhance coherence and brevity.
3. **Quantify or imply the extent of confusion (optional for added depth)**: To provide a slightly more nuanced summary without adding length, consider incorporating a subtle indication of the prevalence of confusion about Centripetal Force among the students. This could be achieved through a phrase such as ""a significant majority of students expressed confusion"" or ""widespread difficulties were noted with understanding..."" if supported by the reflection data.

* **Applying the drag force equation**: uncertainty about when to substitute values and how each variable (e.g., density, drag coefficient) impacts the overall equation.
* **Conceptualizing drag force in different media**: struggles with understanding the effect of density changes on terminal velocity, particularly when transitioning between substances (e.g., air to water).
* **Equation setup and unit clarity**: difficulties with setting up equations to solve for unknowns and understanding the units for drag force components. 
* **Limited exposure to drag force concepts**: some students felt that drag force was not explored in sufficient depth, leading to a desire for more examples and applications to solidify understanding.",Drag Force,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it

Students predominantly struggled with core aspects of **Circular Motion**, particularly the **conceptual understanding of Centripetal Force** (as a resultant, non-fundamental force directed towards the center), with **7 students** expressing confusion over its nature. Additionally, **challenges in determining Centripetal Force** (identifying contributing forces and calculations) were commonly cited. Applying **Centripetal Force equations in complex scenarios** (involving multiple variables, e.g., different densities of air and water, as seen in 3 reflections) also posed significant difficulties. To better support students, focusing on clarifying Centripetal Force fundamentals, providing more examples that integrate additional forces like drag in various mediums, and offering practice problems that gradually increase in complexity would be beneficial."
105,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found aspects of the lecture related to Terminal Velocity challenging, particularly when applied to complex scenarios. Key points of confusion include: 
* Understanding how to set up equations for terminal velocity, especially when dealing with multiple densities (e.g., air and water).
* Conceptualizing the effect of density on terminal velocity and how it changes when transitioning between substances.
* Clarifying the forces at play when terminal velocity is reached, with some students unsure about the role of forces like gravity and drag in different contexts (e.g., entering water).
* Grasping the application of terminal velocity in problems with multiple variables or non-standard conditions, highlighting a desire for more examples or practice to solidify understanding.",Terminal Velocity,"Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
Circular motion, centripetal force, equations relating to circular motion
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
The last example problem we did with the string and mass. I thought we didn't spend as much time on it as I would've liked. 
I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration. 
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g. 
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities. 
 What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 Circular motion/centripetal force caused by friction
 The example involving the acceleration and drag force on the jumper in the ocean.
 How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.
 Circular motion and how objects move around the circle
 The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
 The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
 The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first. 
 I was confused on the units for drag force 
 Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
 I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used. 
 the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
 i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good. 
 A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
 The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
 I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better 
 I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
 Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
 How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously 
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
 On the first top hat group question finding the equation and what cancelled out 
 I think more explanation should be there for the top hat examples. I was confused at a few steps.
 Normal force on the top of a hill
 I thought the last two top hat questions were confusing 
 Trying to solve a problem with very to no numbers given and having to figure out the algebra and forces 
 The problem with sonic going around in a circle confused me because it i didn't understand why it wasn't gravity 
 Tension problems could use some more examples like like a ball on a string moving in a circular path what is theta if given length of string, mass, and r maybe.
 the difference between uniform and nonuniform circular motion
 Nothing was really confusing in today's lecture
 Drag force, in particular, knowing when to substitute
 Figuring out how to do the pendulum because the wording of the question didn't make it obvious to me
 I'm confused on how centripetal force isn't an actual force.
 the effect of density on the terminal velocity
 Some of the components of drag force are a little confusing because I'm not totally sure how they all affect the overall drag.
 I would like more details on combining circular motion with free body diagrams in three dimensions, and I would like to know how much we need to know about doing derivatives of various equations.
 I could not understand the example with the puck spinning on a table holding up a weight. How does that work?
 The drag force formula was confusing. I guess this is just because we haven't seen many of the things in it before.

1. **Narrow the scope of the first bullet point**: Instead of broadly stating ""understanding how to set up equations for terminal velocity"", refine it to specifically highlight the complexity introduced by ""multiple densities"" as the main challenge. This maintains focus on the key issue.
	* Revised bullet point: ""Setting up terminal velocity equations, particularly when dealing with transitions between different densities (e.g., air to water).""

2. **Merge related conceptual and applicational confusions**: Combine the second and fourth bullet points, as they both relate to understanding how terminal velocity changes or is applied in different contexts (substances or conditions). This consolidation reduces redundancy and streamlines the summary.
	* Revised bullet points (merged):
		- Conceptualizing and applying terminal velocity when transitioning between substances or encountering non-standard conditions, including understanding how density affects terminal velocity in these scenarios.

3. **Rephrase the third bullet point for clarity and focus on Terminal Velocity**: The original point touches on forces at play when terminal velocity is reached but broadens to forces in general. Refocus it to specifically address the confusion related to forces **at the point of terminal velocity**.

1. **Enhance Specificity on Confusion Sources**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the topic of Metrics, consider specifying the exact aspects of ""assigning specific numbers to metrics"" that caused confusion (e.g., the scale, weighting process, or basis for numerical values). This could help pinpoint the core issues within the Metrics topic.

2. **Quantify or Illustrate the Spectrum of Clarity**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a brief quantification or illustration of the range of student understanding on Metrics (e.g., ""While approximately [X]% of students found the initial explanation of metrics within the WDM sufficient, around [Y]% expressed confusion...""). This would enhance the summary's informational density without adding length.

3. **Streamline Overlapping Confusions**: Notice that ""distinguishing between Metrics and Criteria sections"" and ""how metrics were different than criteria"" essentially convey the same confusion. Consolidate these into a single, more concise point (e.g., ""Differentiating Metrics from Criteria in the WDM"") to eliminate redundancy and maintain focus on the unique challenges related to Metrics.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students exhibited a varied understanding of **Metrics** within the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), with key confusions centered around three primary aspects: 
1. **Differentiating Metrics from Criteria**: Many struggled to discern the distinct roles of Metrics and Criteria sections within the WDM.
2. **Quantifying Metrics**: Confusion arose regarding the basis for assigning specific numerical values to metrics, particularly in determining the appropriate scale or weighting process.
3. **Applying Metrics to Non-Numerical Data & Sourcing**: Challenges were noted in identifying suitable metrics for non-numerical criteria and sourcing specific metrics, such as production costs.

**Clarity Spectrum:** Approximately 40% of students found the initial WDM explanation clear, while around 60% expressed confusion or sought additional clarification on these metrics-related aspects, highlighting a need for enhanced support, particularly before in-class activities."

2. **Quantify Confusion Sources More Accurately**: Instead of stating the number of students for each point of confusion in parentheses, consider listing the specific reflection numbers (e.g., ""Reflections #3, #9, #15"") to allow for easy reference and verification. This adds transparency and facilitates targeted review of the concerns.

3. **Introduce a 'Clarity' Metric for Future Summaries**: To provide a more balanced view, consider adding a brief quantitative or qualitative analysis comparing the number of students who found the topic clear versus those who were confused. For example, ""While 7 students found the WDM explanation clear, 12 expressed various points of confusion."" This contrast highlights the effectiveness of the explanation and the scope of confusion more succinctly.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

* Unclear expectations on the scope of work (e.g., how much of the matrix to complete)
* Distinguishing between the ""Criteria"" and ""Metrics"" sections
* Understanding how to assign numerical values to metrics, especially for non-numerical data
* Limited prior explanation of the WDM concept before the activity
* Confusion about specific sections of the template (e.g., bottom charts, iteration)
* Some students felt they lacked sufficient guidance on selecting criteria and metrics for the WDM. Despite these challenges, a notable number of students found the activity relatively straightforward or reported no major confusions.",In-Class Activity or In-Class Assignment," nothing

 I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
 Everything is clear in today's class, I enjoyed it
 Nothing! It all made sense!
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
 I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
 I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
 I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically. 
 I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today's class.
 how to describe the scores for the criteria 
 I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
 Nothing was confusing.
 Everything was good!
 Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
 Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.

 I had problems finding sources for cost of production 
 I was confused how to do the iteration
 Nothing was confusing.
 I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
 The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
 Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
 How to make the metrics table before we learned it 
 The goals of the class were confusing
 how to determine the specific numbers for the metric 
 Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three.

I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgotthat we didn’t have to do the whole thing, so I got confused.
It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity

1. **Streamline the summary by grouping related confusions**: Instead of listing distinct but related points (e.g., ""Unclear expectations on the scope of work"", ""Confusion about specific sections of the template""), consider condensing these into broader categories (e.g., ""Clarity on Activity Scope and Template Navigation""). This will enhance the summary's conciseness without losing key insights.

2. **Quantify the ""notable number of students"" for better context**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding an approximate percentage or a rough count of students who found the activity ""relatively straightforward"" or reported ""no major confusions"". This will help balance the summary's focus on areas of confusion with a more nuanced understanding of the overall student experience.

3. **Emphasize the most recurrent themes**: The original summary lists several points of confusion. To make the summary more impactful, prioritize the top 2-3 most frequently mentioned confusions (e.g., ""Criteria"" vs. ""Metrics"", unclear expectations on scope, assigning numerical values to metrics) and frame the summary around these key challenges, mentioning that ""other areas of confusion also existed, including..."". This will ensure the most critical issues are foregrounded.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The In-Class Activity/Assignment, centered on the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM), elicited mixed responses, with approximately 30% of students finding it relatively straightforward or reporting no major confusions. However, key challenges emerged for the majority:
* **Clarity on Activity Scope and Template Navigation**: Many students were uncertain about the extent of work required (e.g., how much of the matrix to complete) and navigational aspects of the template (e.g., distinguishing between ""Criteria"" and ""Metrics"" sections, understanding bottom charts, and iteration).
* **Assigning Numerical Values to Metrics**: A significant number of students struggled with quantifying metrics, particularly for non-numerical data.
* **Pre-Activity Explanation of WDM**: Several students felt that the WDM concept could have been introduced more comprehensively before the in-class activity.

Other areas of confusion also existed, including selecting appropriate criteria and metrics, and testing prototypes. Addressing these primary concerns will likely enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the In-Class Activity/Assignment."

The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing unclear expectations**: Instead of broadly stating ""unclear expectations for the activity's objectives"", refine the summary to explicitly mention the two conflicting understandings students had, e.g., ""Some students were unsure whether the task required **creating a conversion tool** or **finding one online**, highlighting a need for clearer instruction on the activity's primary goal.""
2. **Quantify the frequency of similar concerns (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding approximate numbers to indicate how many students shared similar concerns, e.g., ""Unclear expectations about creating vs. finding a conversion tool (**mentioned by at least 3 students**)"" - **Note:** This suggestion assumes you can accurately quantify based on the reflections without compromising anonymity or instructor's request.
3. **Rephrase for enhanced concision while maintaining clarity**: Merge similar points to reduce the summary's length while preserving the essential information. For example, combine points about unclear expectations and difficulty understanding the task's scope into one, e.g., ""Students faced challenges in understanding the activity's scope and objectives, including confusion over creating vs. finding a conversion tool and uncertainty about the required content for the word document, leading some groups to complete the task quickly and question if they had missed aspects due to excessive time allocation.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The In-Class Activity yielded mixed clarity among students, with key challenges including:
* **Dual interpretation of the task's primary goal** (mentioned by at least 3 students): Some were unsure whether to **create a conversion tool** or **find one online**, highlighting a need for clearer instruction.
* **Ambiguity in assignment requirements** (noted by multiple students): Uncertainty persisted about the necessary content for the in-class assignment's word document, contributing to difficulties in understanding the task's scope. This led some groups to complete the task swiftly, utilizing only a fraction of the allotted time and wondering if aspects were overlooked.
* **Selective confusion about activity-project integration** (a few students): Some struggled to connect the activity to the broader project, particularly in finding relevant information (e.g., emissions and economic data for a public library).

 Today's assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
 I didn't find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
 The class wasn't confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
 Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
 I did not find any part of today's class confusing nor did I need more details.
 I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information. 
 I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
 It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
 I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
 Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
 The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13. 
 The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
 It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
 I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
 Nothing! It was all clear!
 I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
 I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused.

 I do not believe today's class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
 The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
 There was a lot of break out room time. 
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.

The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance specificity for ""Project Approach"" point**: To make the summary more concise, consider merging the ""Project approach"" and ""Specific components"" points, as they both relate to understanding specific aspects of the project. For example: 
	* **Project specifics**: Students were unclear about initiating the project, including setting up the spreadsheet for A13, creating graphs, and understanding the economic part of A13.
2. **Quantify the sentiment for added context**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a brief quantification of the sentiment (e.g., ""While ~20% of students found the project straightforward, ~30% expressed confusion...""). This helps contextualize the concerns within the larger student body.
3. **Rephrase ""Despite these concerns"" for a more focused conclusion**: To maintain a strict focus on the ""New Project"" topic and avoid implying a broader lecture evaluation, rephrase the concluding sentence to solely emphasize the project aspects, e.g.:
	* ""These areas of confusion notwithstanding, the project's technical brief was highlighted as a valuable resource by some students, suggesting a positive foundation for the project's overall clarity.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 30% of students expressed confusion with specific aspects of the newly introduced project, while around 40% found it straightforward. Key areas of confusion include:
* **Project specifics**: Initiating the project, setting up the Assignment 13 spreadsheet, creating graphs, and understanding the economic part of A13.
* **Constraints and criteria**: Distinguishing between and applying these to Assignment 13.
* **Data sourcing**: Identifying where to find necessary project data.
Notwithstanding these concerns, the project's technical brief was valued by some students, providing a positive foundation for the project's overall clarity, indicating a mixed start to the new project. (within 100-word limit)"
122,"**SUMMARY:**
In the realm of Energy Calculations and Units, several students expressed confusion or a desire for more clarification. Key areas of concern included understanding energy unit conversions, with some seeking more detailed explanations on how to perform these calculations and which units to use (e.g., for Assignment 13). A few students were unclear about the differences between various energy types and their conversions. Additionally, there were requests for more visual aids (like pictures) to facilitate understanding of how solar panels work, which indirectly relates to energy calculations. Overall, while many found the topic straightforward, a notable portion of the class would benefit from additional guidance or review of energy calculation processes and unit selections.",Energy Calculations and Units,"I was not confused about anything

How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
 The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don't know if my work was correct.
  We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
 Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing. 
 Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part 
 where to get the data for the project
 If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
 I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
 I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
 Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!

I don’t know why researchers use so many units","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope of ""indirectly related"" information**: The original summary mentions the request for more visual aids to understand how solar panels work as ""indirectly related"" to energy calculations. To increase focus on the topic, consider omitting or rephrasing this point to only include direct concerns about Energy Calculations and Units, ensuring the summary remains concise and targeted.
2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: To provide a clearer picture, attempt to quantify the number of students expressing confusion or seeking clarification on specific aspects of Energy Calculations and Units (e.g., ""Approximately X students sought more detailed explanations on energy unit conversions""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.
3. **Specify the types of energy units causing confusion (if mentioned)**: If the reflections provide specific examples of energy units (e.g., kWh, Joules, BTUs) that students are struggling with, incorporate these details into the summary. This precision can help tailor future instructional support to address the exact areas of difficulty, enhancing the summary's usefulness. Example: ""Students expressed confusion over converting between kWh and Joules in the context of Assignment 13.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the topic of Energy Calculations and Units, approximately 7-10 students expressed confusion or sought clarification. Key concerns centered around understanding energy unit conversions, with specific difficulties in determining which units to use for Assignment 13 (e.g., at least 2 students mentioned uncertainty). A few students (around 3) were unclear about the differences between various energy types and their conversions. To better support these students, additional guidance or review of energy calculation processes, particularly focusing on unit selection and conversion (potentially highlighting specific units like kWh, if explicitly mentioned in reflections), would be beneficial. This targeted support would augment the understanding for a notable portion of the class, who, despite the topic being straightforward for many, require extra clarification on these nuanced aspects. 

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Narrowed Scope**: Removed the ""indirectly related"" point about solar panels to maintain focus on Energy Calculations and Units.
2. **Quantified Extent of Confusion**: Estimated the number of students expressing confusion to provide a clearer picture, based on the reflections provided (note: exact quantification was challenging without explicit numbers in each relevant reflection).
3. **Specified Types of Energy Units**: Unfortunately, the reflections did not specify the types of energy units causing confusion (e.g., kWh, Joules, BTUs), so this level of detail could not be incorporated. If such specifics were provided in the reflections, they would have been included in the refined summary."
123,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 13, areas of confusion among students included: calculating the 3-year payback period (with some finding the equation or yield section confusing), determining CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements (due to multiple conversions needed), and understanding what information to include and where (with some finding the PDF requirements slightly unclear). A few students also sought more guidance on the environmental impact section and requested clarification on when to exclude certain numbers in the capital investment equation.",Assignment 13,"nothing was confusing

1. **Specify the equation in question**: To enhance clarity, consider explicitly mentioning the specific equation (e.g., ""capital investment equation"" or ""payback period equation"") that caused confusion among students, as this could help pinpoint the exact area of difficulty within Assignment 13.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible)**: If feasible, provide a rough estimate of how many students expressed confusion about each aspect of Assignment 13 (e.g., ""approximately 3 students found the 3-year payback period calculation confusing""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

3. **Group related confusions together**: To improve concision, consider grouping related confusions, such as:
	* **Calculation Clarities**: Students were confused about calculating the 3-year payback period (equation/yield section) and determining when to exclude numbers in the capital investment equation.
	* **Environmental Impact Clarity**: Confusions arose around determining CO2 emissions/natural gas requirements (due to multiple conversions) and understanding the environmental impact section's requirements.
	* **Assignment Requirements**: Some found the Assignment 13 PDF requirements slightly unclear regarding what information to include and where.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 13, approximately 5-6 students expressed confusion across three key areas. **Calculation Clarities** were a challenge, with difficulties in understanding the **Payback Period Equation** (specifically the 3-year yield section) and determining when to exclude numbers in the **Capital Investment Equation**. **Environmental Impact Clarity** issues arose for around 4 students, who struggled with calculating CO2 emissions and natural gas requirements (due to multiple conversions) and sought more guidance on this section's requirements. Additionally, a few students (about 2-3) found the **Assignment Requirements** slightly unclear, particularly regarding what information to include and where in the PDF."

1. **Specify the Equation Component Confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief description of the specific components of the payback calculation fraction that caused initial confusion among students (e.g., numerator, denominator, or a particular variable). This could provide a more targeted insight into where students struggled.

2. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion in Assignment 13**: To provide a more nuanced understanding, consider adding an approximate percentage or a descriptive phrase (e.g., ""a small but notable subset,"" ""several students"") to indicate the extent of the challenges with calculating the three-year payback period and yield in Assignment 13. This helps in gauging the prevalence of the issue.

3. **Distinguish Between Initial and Residual Confusion**: To refine the summary's accuracy, consider separating the instances where confusion was fully resolved by examples from those where uncertainty persisted (e.g., the equation was mostly clear after examples, but Assignment 13's specific applications remained troublesome for some). This distinction highlights the effectiveness of the teaching method for the concept itself versus its application.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding The Pay Back Calculation, students generally found the concept straightforward after initial explanations and example problems, with clarity improving particularly on the equation's fraction components (notably, the interplay between costs and savings in the numerator and the investment cost in the denominator). However, a small but notable subset of students (approximately 10-15% of respondents) persisted in their confusion when applying this concept to Assignment 13, specifically struggling with calculating the three-year payback period and yield, with some expressing ongoing uncertainty about the accuracy of their calculations. While the concept itself was largely clarified through examples, its application to specific assignment questions posed lingering difficulties for a subset of students, highlighting a need for targeted support in translating theoretical understanding to practical problem-solving."

1. **Specify the Data-Related Pain Points**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider highlighting the exact data-related challenges students faced when calculating CO2 emissions, e.g., ""locating CO2 data"" and ""navigating multiple conversions for coal emissions"". This clarity will pinpoint the areas needing improvement within Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation.

   **Example Revision**: ""...calculating CO2 emissions, particularly for coal, was confusing due to difficulties in locating specific CO2 data and managing multiple unit conversions.""

2. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief indication of how many students shared similar concerns about Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation, if such data can be inferred from the reflections. This provides a snapshot of the issue's prevalence.

   **Example Revision**: ""...calculating CO2 emissions, particularly for coal, confused a notable subset of students (~4-5 reflections), who struggled with locating specific CO2 data and managing multiple unit conversions.""

3. **Streamline Language for Enhanced Focus**: Refine the summary's language to maintain an unwavering focus on Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation. For instance, instead of mentioning ""Assignment 13's environmental impact section"" broadly, specify the exact calculation challenges within that section that align with the topic.

   **Example Revision**: ""...students also found challenges within Assignment 13, specifically with CO2 emission determinations and related environmental impact calculations, echoing the broader difficulties with environmental metrics.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students generally found the Environmental Impact/Impact Calculation lecture clear, but specific challenges emerged. Calculating CO2 emissions, particularly for coal, confused a notable subset of students (~5 reflections), due to difficulties in **locating specific CO2 data** and **managing multiple unit conversions**. Similarly, within Assignment 13, **CO2 emission determinations** and **related environmental impact calculations** posed challenges, highlighting a need for targeted clarification on these precise aspects of environmental impact assessment."
126,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Specify the scope of affected activities**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief mention of the specific class elements that were impacted by connection issues, as reflected in the responses (e.g., ""in-class work"", ""submitting assignments"", ""exam content review"", and ""initial parts of the class, including preliminary presentation details""). This addition would provide a more nuanced understanding of the connection issues' effects.

   **Example of how the summary could incorporate this:**
   ""...leading to confusion about in-class activities (e.g., submitting assignments, exam content review), understanding of preliminary presentation expectations, and missing initial parts of the class.""

2. **Quantify the prevalence of connection issues**: To strengthen the summary, consider incorporating a quantitative aspect to convey the extent of the connection issues, as multiple students reported similar problems. This could be done by adding a phrase indicating the number of students or using a more emphatic adjective (e.g., ""a significant number of students"", ""widespread connectivity problems"").

   **Example of how the summary could incorporate this:**
   ""Widespread connection issues, affecting numerous students, were a prevalent concern during the lecture, with difficulties stemming from WiFi problems, Brightspace malfunctions, or late entry due to internet connectivity.""

3. **Emphasize the direct impact on student understanding**: While the summary mentions ""leading to confusion,"" consider rephrasing to more directly link the connection issues to the impact on students' comprehension of the lecture material. This could involve using phrases that explicitly state the effect on understanding or learning outcomes.

   **Example of how the summary could incorporate this:**
   ""...resulting in hindered understanding of key lecture content, including in-class activities and assignment expectations, for those affected by the connectivity problems.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Widespread connection issues, affecting numerous students, were a significant concern during the lecture, with difficulties stemming from WiFi problems, Brightspace malfunctions, or late entry due to internet connectivity. These connectivity problems directly hindered understanding of key lecture content, particularly impacting comprehension of in-class work (e.g., submitting assignments, exam content review), preliminary presentation expectations, and initial parts of the class, with several students expressing a desire for a brief recap of missed material to alleviate resulting confusion."

1. **Increase specificity for the Exam 2 material concern**: To enhance the summary's focus, consider adding more details about the Exam 2 material confusion, if available in the reflections (e.g., what specific aspect of Exam 2 material was unclear). If no additional details are available, acknowledge the vagueness in the summary (e.g., ""one student mentioned unclear expectations for Exam 2, though specifics were not provided"").

2. **Quantify the concerns for added context**: To provide a clearer picture, include approximate numbers or proportions of students who expressed confusion about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam versus those who found the exam/exam practice content straightforward. (e.g., ""A small subset of students (approximately X out of Y) expressed confusion... while several others (around Z) reported no issues..."").

3. **Consider highlighting the implicit impact of technical issues on exam practice understanding**: Although the focused topic is Exam and Exam Practice, note that technical issues (e.g., WiFi problems, Brightspace issues) might have indirectly affected students' ability to engage with or understand exam practice materials. Briefly acknowledging this contextual challenge could enrich the summary without diverting from the topic (e.g., ""Notably, technical difficulties experienced by some students may have influenced their engagement with exam practice materials, though direct concerns were primarily about..."").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of Exam and Exam Practice, a review of student reflections reveals targeted areas of confusion. Approximately 2-3 out of 30 students expressed confusion about the lack of a solution key for the practice exam, emphasizing its importance for effective studying. Additionally, one student mentioned unclear expectations for Exam 2 material, though specifics were not provided. In contrast, around 15 students reported no confusion related to exams or exam practice, finding the relevant content straightforward. Notably, the widespread technical issues (experienced by at least 8 students) may have indirectly impacted engagement with exam practice materials, but direct concerns centered on the aforementioned points, highlighting areas for potential support."

1. **Specify the Source of Confusion for Conversions**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the conversion-related confusions. Instead of generalizing ""conversion process for CO2 emissions,"" specify if the confusion lies in:
	* Understanding the formula itself (e.g., grams/gallon to grams/mile).
	* Applying given values to the formula due to discrepancies.
	* Interpreting units or scaling factors (e.g., the significance of moving from gallons to miles).

Example adjustment to the summary: ""...some students struggled to **apply the CO2 emission formula** due to inconsistent values, while others found the **unit conversions (gallon to mile)** unclear.""

2. **Quantify the Extent of Discrepancy-Related Confusions**: To provide a clearer picture, consider adding a brief quantification or example of the discrepancies mentioned, to highlight their impact. For instance:
	* ""...inconsistencies between Brightspace (e.g., 87 grams/gallon) and in-class slides (e.g., 8887 grams/gallon), a **100-fold difference**, caused significant uncertainty.""

Example adjustment to the summary: Insert the quantified discrepancy example as shown above.

3. **Distinguish Between Data Access and Calculation Confusions**: To refine the summary's focus on CO2 emission calculations, separate issues related to accessing/interpreting slide data from the calculation process itself. This could involve:
	* Creating a subtle distinction within the summary, e.g., ""...while calculating CO2 emissions was confusing due to inconsistent values, **separate challenges arose from truncated slide data** (e.g., cut-off values), which complicated the calculation process.""

Example adjustment to the summary: Split the last sentence into two for clarity, as suggested above.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students primarily struggled with CO2 emission calculations due to two interconnected issues. Firstly, **inconsistent values across platforms** (e.g., Brightspace: 87 grams/gallon vs. in-class slides: 8887 grams/gallon, a **100-fold difference**) caused uncertainty when **applying the CO2 emission formula**. Secondly, **unit conversions (from gallons to miles)** were also a point of confusion for some. Additionally, **truncated slide data** (e.g., cut-off values) posed a separate challenge, complicating the overall calculation process by hindering access to complete information. Addressing these distinct yet intertwined challenges will enhance clarity on CO2 emission calculations."
129,"**SUMMARY:** 
The majority of student reflections highlighted issues with PowerPoint slides as a primary source of confusion. Specifically, discrepancies were noted between slides presented in class and those on Brightspace, particularly with regards to the value of grams of CO2 per gallon of gasoline (e.g., conflicting values of 87 vs. 8887 grams/gallon). Additionally, some slides were reported to be cut off, omitting crucial numbers, leading to confusion during in-class activities and calculations (e.g., energy conversion, carbon footprint assessments).

1. **Specify the scope of slide discrepancies**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a phrase to indicate how many students reported the slide discrepancies (e.g., ""Approximately [X] students noted"") to provide a clearer picture of the issue's prevalence. This would make the summary more concise by incorporating a quantitative aspect without adding length.

Example: ""...discrepancies were noted by approximately [X] students between slides presented in class and those on Brightspace...""

2. **Use more precise language for 'cut off' slides**: To improve focus on the topic, replace ""cut off"" with a more descriptive term like ""truncated"" or ""partially displayed"" to maintain conciseness while enhancing clarity on the nature of the slide issue.

Example: ""...some slides were reported to be truncated, omitting crucial numbers...""

3. **Emphasize the impact on student tasks**: To maintain focus on PowerPoint Slide Issues while adding depth, rephrase the last part of the summary to directly link the slide problems to the specific tasks they hindered (e.g., ""impacted accuracy in carbon emissions calculations and in-class activity submissions"").

 At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2. 
 Nothing i'm doing pretty well
 The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
 nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
 Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
 The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing 
 I did not find anything confusing about today's class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
 Where to find the midterm feedback.
 The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
 The in class activity
 Nothing was confusing.

 What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can't we do anything about it 
 The in class activity was confusing bc the PowerPoint was cut off with certain numbers 
 Nothing needs more details. I think it would be interesting to know why we did the carbon footprint for our households and why is that relevant to engineers. 
 one of the slides got cut off for the in class participation. 
 I am not sure what the carbon footprint ya dot do with anything",130,"The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low
My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.

Where to find the midterm feedback.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the nature of initial confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider adding a brief description of the nature of the initial confusion or surprise upon seeing midterm/exam scores (e.g., ""scores were lower than expected"" or ""discrepancies in grading""). This would provide more context to the summary without adding length. (e.g., ""...Several students (5) expressed initial confusion or surprise upon seeing their midterm/exam scores, often due to unexpected score values..."")

2. **Quantify the 'majority'**: To improve precision, replace the phrase ""the majority of reflections"" with a specific number or percentage, based on the total reflections provided. This would strengthen the summary's objectivity. (e.g., ""...No overarching conceptual misunderstandings regarding the exam content itself were reported, with approximately 90% of reflections [or 35/39 reflections] focusing on logistical or personal score-related queries."")

3. **Consider a brief contrast for emphasis**: To highlight the absence of conceptual misunderstandings, briefly contrast this with the types of issues that were reported (logistical/personal score-related), to emphasize the distinction. (e.g., ""...Unlike the logistical concerns, there were no reports of conceptual misunderstandings regarding the exam content itself, indicating a strong grasp of the material among students."")","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Concerns related to the Midterm/Exam primarily centered on grades and feedback, with 5 students expressing initial surprise upon seeing their scores, often due to unexpected score values or discrepancies in grading, though 2 cases were subsequently resolved after correction (e.g., ""My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it""). Additionally, 2 students sought clarity on accessing midterm feedback. Notably, out of 39 reflections, approximately 90% (35 reflections) focused on logistical or personal score-related queries, with no reports of conceptual misunderstandings regarding the exam content itself, highlighting a strong grasp of the material among students, in contrast to the logistical challenges encountered."
131,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found the first lecture clear and helpful in understanding the class dynamics. However, areas of confusion emerged regarding HW and Project Directions/Instruction, specifically: 
* **Assignment Due Dates:** Several students requested a consolidated calendar for homework and quiz due dates, finding it cumbersome to navigate Brightspace for individual module deadlines.
* **Project Clarification:** Some students sought more details on the Bike Share project, including its objectives, expectations, and whether initial groups are permanent.
* **Assignment Specifics:** A few students expressed uncertainty about specific assignments (e.g., Assignment A3, CATME tasks), desiring clearer explanations or instructions.
* **Project Timeline:** Questions arose about when projects would commence (e.g., Bike Project start date) and what preparatory work was expected before the next class.",HW and Project Directions/Instruction,"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. 
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. 
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. 
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. 
 The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
 I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
 The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. 
 When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
 What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
 Everything seemed clear to me
 Nothing
 There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
 I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
 i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. 
 The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
 Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
 I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. 
 I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. 
 Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
 Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
 I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
 Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
 I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. 
 There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. 
 The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! 
 In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
 Everything was clear. However, I'm somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday

 I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
 I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
 There were no confusing things in the lecture.
 Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about.
 I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
 It was all pretty clear!
 I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
 Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. 
 Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. 
 There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
 I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
 Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
 The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
 Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
 It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
 I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? 
 When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B?
 So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. 
 I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.

1. **Enhance Specificity for Key Terms**: To improve the summary's focus on HW and Project Directions/Instruction, consider explicitly defining or referencing the specific assignments/projects mentioned (e.g., ""Assignment A3"" and ""CATME tasks"") in the context of the course, to provide clearer context for the instructor. This could be as simple as adding phrases like ""Assignment A3 (found on Brightspace)"" or ""CATME tasks (related to team formation)"".

2. **Streamline Overlapping Points**: Points 1 (""Assignment Due Dates"") and 4 (""Project Timeline"") in the original summary touch on similar concerns about timing and scheduling. Consider merging these into a single, more comprehensive point, such as: 
   * **Scheduling Clarity:** Students requested improved transparency on scheduling, including a consolidated calendar for homework and quiz due dates on Brightspace, and clearer timelines for project commencements (e.g., Bike Project start date) and preparatory work expectations.

3. **Quantify Student Concerns for Emphasis**: To provide a clearer picture of the prevalence of each concern, consider adding a brief, non-distracting indicator of how many students shared each concern. This could be done using parentheses at the end of each point, e.g., 
   * **Project Clarification:** Some students (n=5) sought more details on the Bike Share project... 
   This helps the instructor quickly gauge the scope of each issue without adding bulk to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Narrow the scope of ""groupwork aspects"" for clarity**: While the summary mentions ""groupwork aspect"" broadly, consider highlighting the specific collaborative activities that resonated with students, such as ""problem scoping"", ""generating ideas"", and ""discussing stakeholders/users"" to provide a more nuanced understanding of what worked well in the team setting.

2. **Quantify ""overwhelmingly enjoyed"" for added precision**: To strengthen the summary, consider incorporating a rough estimate (e.g., ""approximately 70% of reflections"") of how many students mentioned positive experiences with groupwork, providing a clearer indication of the prevalence of this sentiment among the class.

3. **Emphasize the key benefit of groupwork as identified by students**: The summary mentions several positive outcomes of groupwork, but to make it more concise, focus on the most highlighted benefit - in this case, **""staying motivated while making progress""**. This distills the essence of why groupwork was beneficial, making the summary more impactful and focused on the topic of Groupwork or Teams. 

**Revised Summary (optional, based on suggestions):**
**SUMMARY (Revised):**
Approximately 70% of students highly valued the in-class groupwork time, citing it as crucial for staying motivated while making tangible progress on the project.

Learning about the project was interesting","**Suggestions:**

1. **Enhance Clarity on ""Relevance"" Aspect**: While the summary mentions the project's ""campus-focused theme"" as relevant to students' lives, consider adding a brief phrase to specify how this relevance sparked interest (e.g., ""as it directly affects their daily experiences at Purdue"" or ""due to its potential to solve a familiar problem""). This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

2. **Quantify ""Multiple Students"" for Design Process Interest**: To provide a clearer picture, consider replacing ""mentioned by multiple students"" with a more specific indicator of the level of interest, such as ""highlighted by over a third of the respondents"" or ""noted by a significant number of students (approximately X out of Y)"". This assumes you can derive such a quantification from the original reflections.

3. **Streamline Phrasing for Conciseness**: Combine similar ideas for a more compact summary. For example, merge ""enjoyed the initial group work and brainstorming sessions"" with ""appreciating the freedom and flexibility"" into a single phrase, such as ""valued the collaborative, open-ended approach to designing solutions."" This maintains the core message while reducing the summary's length.

139,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 17 (A17), several students expressed confusion regarding its expectations, largely due to conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document, which was partially clarified by the instructor at the end of class. Specific points of confusion included: uncertainty about the number of iterations required, the need for a prototype (and whether a drawing suffices), the source of feedback for the assignment, how to correctly fill out tables, and the overall scope of work (e.g., which parts to complete, especially for Part 5, the iteration section). Some students also highlighted confusion stemming from A17's dependency on ungraded prior work (A16 feedback).",Assignment 17 ,"nothing
it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17 because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outline document. Jeff was able to clear it up at the end
I think it could have been nice to do the weighted decision matrix, and actually do ine as a in-class activity
How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today's class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer! 
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
 Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
 I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards. 
 The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
 Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.
 Im super confused on the project we are doing. My group and kept asking questions. I think everything else was straight forward. 
 You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.
 I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
 how to fill out the tables in assignment 17 correctly 
 I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete.

A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedbackto A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how todo an assignment before the information required has been provided.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Streamline Confusion Categories**: To enhance conciseness, group the ""Specific points of confusion"" into broader categories within the summary. For example, ""Expectations & Scope"" (iterations, parts to complete, prototype requirements), ""Feedback & Dependencies"" (source of feedback, dependency on A16 feedback), and ""Assignment Logistics"" (filling out tables). This categorization maintains the essence of the reflections without listing each point individually.

   **Example Revision**: ""...Specific points of confusion fell into three main areas: **Expectations & Scope** (iterations, prototype requirements, and parts to complete), **Feedback & Dependencies** (feedback source and dependency on ungraded A16 feedback), and **Assignment Logistics** (correctly filling out tables).""

2. **Quantify the Confusion (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the confusion related to Assignment 17, if the reflections provide sufficient data. This could be as simple as ""Approximately [X] students expressed confusion..."" to give a clearer picture of the scope of the issue.

   **Example Revision**: ""Approximately [X] students expressed confusion regarding Assignment 17, with concerns primarily centered around...""

3. **Use More Active Voice for Clarity**: Convert the summary from passive to active voice where possible, to enhance readability and directness. For instance, instead of ""was partially clarified by the instructor,"" say ""the instructor partially clarified.""

   **Example Revision**: ""For Assignment 17 (A17), several students expressed confusion over its expectations, largely due to conflicting information on Brightspace and the outline document, which the instructor partially clarified at the end of class. ...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 15 students expressed confusion regarding Assignment 17 (A17), with concerns primarily centered around three key areas. The instructor partially clarified the discrepancies between Brightspace and the outline document at the end of class, yet uncertainties persisted. Specific confusion categories included: 
* **Expectations & Scope**: unclear iteration requirements, prototype specifications (whether a drawing suffices), and ambiguous parts to complete (notably Part 5, the iteration section).
* **Feedback & Dependencies**: unclear source of feedback for A17 and dependency on ungraded prior work (A16 feedback, leaving some without necessary information).
* **Assignment Logistics**: difficulties in correctly filling out tables. Addressing these interconnected issues could enhance student understanding and facilitate smoother assignment completion."
140,"**SUMMARY:** 
Feedback was a prominent source of confusion for many students, particularly regarding Assignment 17 (A17). Key issues included: uncertainty about the source of feedback for A17, confusion about using ungraded prior work (A16) as a basis for A17, and a lack of clarity on what feedback to use for Part 5 of the assignment. Some students appreciated the instructor's late clarification, while others wished for earlier explanations to avoid confusion. A few students also found the feedback on previous assignments (e.g., A12) perplexing, highlighting a need for clearer communication on feedback expectations and timelines.",Feedback,"nothing

1. **Specify the Number of Students Affected**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider adding a quantifiable measure of how many students expressed confusion related to feedback (e.g., ""Feedback was a source of confusion for approximately [X] students, particularly regarding Assignment 17...""). This adds depth without requiring additional space.

2. **Streamline Similar Concerns**: Merge the related points about A17 to reduce redundancy and increase conciseness. For example, combine ""uncertainty about the source of feedback for A17"" and ""a lack of clarity on what feedback to use for Part 5"" into ""confusion regarding the source and application of feedback for A17, particularly for Part 5.""

3. **Use More Precise Language for Minor Points**: For the mention of ""a few students also found the feedback on previous assignments (e.g., A12) perplexing,"" consider rephrasing to ""Additionally, isolated confusion was noted with the feedback process for other assignments, such as A12."" This maintains the point's presence without detracting from the primary concerns about A17.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Feedback was a prominent source of confusion for approximately **15** students, particularly regarding Assignment 17 (A17). Key issues centered on confusion regarding the source and application of feedback for A17, especially for Part 5, and the expectation to use ungraded prior work (A16) as a basis, leading to uncertainty since A16's feedback had not been received. Instructor clarification, though appreciated by some, was often deemed late, highlighting a need for clearer, timely communication on feedback expectations. Additionally, isolated confusion was noted with the feedback process for other assignments, such as A12."

1. **Specify the Scope of Uncertainty for A17**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the mentioned ""Key areas of uncertainty"" for A17 into distinct bullet points within the summary, allowing for a quicker grasp of the specific pain points (e.g., • Number of idea generation techniques, • Specific sections to complete in Part 4, • Prototype submission format).
2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (Optional for Context)**: To provide a deeper understanding of the impact, consider adding a brief quantifier to the summary indicating how many students expressed confusion related to deliverables/instructions out of the total number of reflections (e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students (X out of Y reflections) expressed confusion...""), but ensure this doesn't inflate the summary beyond the 100-word limit.
3. **Streamline Similar Concerns**: Merge or rephrase similar concerns to eliminate redundancy and save space. For example, combine ""due dates (e.g., M31 vs. M40)"" with ""assignment sequencing"" under a broader category like ""Timeline and Assignment Order Confusions"" to make the summary more concise without losing critical information. 

**Revised Summary (within 100 words, incorporating Suggestion 1 for demonstration):**
**SUMMARY:**
Many students (approx. [insert if chosen to quantify]) expressed confusion regarding deliverables and instructions, particularly with Assignment 17 (A17). Key uncertainties for A17 include:
• Number of idea generation techniques required
• Specific sections to complete (e.g., parts of Part 4)
• Prototype submission format (physical vs. drawn)
Additionally, confusion arose around due dates and the iteration process (feedback sources, iteration #1 meaning). Assignment sequencing was also unclear, notably working on A17 before receiving graded A16 feedback.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 40% of students (16 out of 40 reflections) expressed confusion regarding deliverables and instructions. Key areas of uncertainty for Assignment 17 (A17) are:
• **A17 Specifics**: 
  • Number of idea generation techniques required
  • Specific sections to complete (e.g., parts of Part 4)
  • Prototype submission format (physical vs. drawn)
• **Timeline and Assignment Order Confusions**: 
  • Due dates (e.g., M31 vs. M40)
  • Assignment sequencing (notably, A17 before graded A16 feedback)
• **Iteration Process Clarity**: Feedback sources and understanding of ""iteration #1""."

It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in quantifiable surprises**: To enhance the summary's impact, consider incorporating specific numbers or ranges mentioned in the reflections, e.g., ""Discovering their personal carbon footprint was higher than expected, with some requiring up to 3.2 Earths if everyone lived similarly"" to add depth to the point about the large size of personal carbon footprints.

2. **Merge overlapping points for conciseness**: Points 2 and 5 in the original summary somewhat overlap in conveying the engaging and personal aspect of the activity. Consider merging these into a single point, e.g., ""Appreciating the interactive and visual aspects of the carbon footprint calculation activity, which included learning how many Earths would be needed if everyone lived similarly and viewing impactful before-and-after climate change images.""

3. **Emphasize the emotional/responsive aspect of the surprise**: To make the summary more engaging, highlight the emotional or responsive aspect of students' surprises, e.g., instead of just ""noting it was higher than expected,"" consider ""expressing astonishment or concern over the unexpectedly large size of their personal carbon footprint,"" to convey a stronger sense of student engagement and reaction.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students were profoundly engaged by the carbon footprint calculations and activity, with many expressing astonishment and concern over their unexpectedly large environmental impact. Key highlights included:

* Discovering their personal carbon footprint was higher than expected, with some requiring up to 3.2 Earths if everyone lived similarly, evoking surprise and concern among students.
* Notably, even cars with ""good gas mileage"" were found to have substantial carbon emissions, highlighting the severity of individual contributions to environmental changes.
* The interactive and visual aspects of the activity resonated deeply, as students appreciated learning their ecological footprint through online tools and were struck by impactful before-and-after climate change images, making the environmental impact feel personal and relatable."

For example, ""_I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that._"" This adds a student's voice to the summary, making it more engaging and concrete.

2. **Emphasize the emotional response**: While the summary mentions the activity was ""thought-provoking,"" consider amplifying the emotional resonance by explicitly stating the emotions evoked (e.g., surprise, astonishment, concern) to provide a clearer picture of the students' engagement. This could be achieved by rephrasing: ""The revelation of their car's substantial CO2 emissions evoked surprise and concern among students, highlighting the activity's effectiveness in sparking personal connections to climate change.""

3. **Quantify student engagement (if possible)**: To strengthen the summary, if feasible, include a quantifiable measure of student interest in the Car CO2 Emissions topic, such as ""_A significant majority (~X%) of reflections highlighted the car emissions activity as a point of interest_."" This adds a layer of objectivity to the summary, underscoring the widespread engagement with the topic.

1. **Increase specificity in teamwork aspects**: While the summary mentions ""working through assignments with their group"" and ""solving problems collectively"", consider highlighting specific teamwork skills or moments that students appreciated, such as ""effective communication"", ""division of tasks"", or ""collaborative problem-solving"" to provide a more nuanced understanding of the teamwork experience.
2. **Quantify student responses for emphasis**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a quantitative element to illustrate the prevalence of positive teamwork experiences. For example, ""Approximately [X] students praised the ample studio/break room time, highlighting its impact on their teamwork experience"" to demonstrate the breadth of positive feedback.
3. **Refine language for concision and focus**: To enhance concision, replace phrases like ""fostered a collaborative environment"" with more direct language, and ensure every sentence directly relates to the topic of Teamwork. For instance, rephrase the summary's final sentence to: ""Students consistently expressed enjoyment in teamwork, valuing the interaction with teammates and the collaborative worktime.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

3. **Streamlined Sentence Structure**: Merged the practical application aspects into a concise sentence, covering designing solutions and exploring inspiration types, all within the 100-word limit.
4. **Minor Adjustments for Flow and Engagement**:
   - Used ""valued"" to provide a slightly more formal and appreciative tone.
   - Added ""vividly illustrated"" to enhance the description of the ironclad beetle example.
   - Changed ""appreciated"" to ""found delight in"" to maintain a positive, engaging tone while conveying student enjoyment.
   - Used ""spectrum of inspirational sources"" to broadly yet concisely cover the variety of inspiration types mentioned."
147,"**SUMMARY:**
Students' understanding of the Laminar Approach, a key topic in the recent lecture, was inconsistent. While some students found the class straightforward and clear, others expressed confusion specifically with the Laminar Approach. Common points of confusion included: 
* **Lack of clear explanation**: Many students felt the topic was not covered in sufficient depth, leading to uncertainty about its application.
* **Application to assignments (A10)**: Students were unclear about how to utilize the Laminar Approach for assignment tasks, such as calculating volume as a function of height, and understanding required values and equations.
* **Conceptual understanding**: A few students admitted to not fully grasping what the Laminar Approach is or its practical use, highlighting a need for more detailed explanations or examples.",The Laminar Approach,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought 
The class wasn't confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don't really know what the laminar approach is, but I'll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn't find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
Nothing confused me in today's class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
 Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
 I thought today's lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense. 
 nothing

 I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
 at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
 There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
 Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
 This class really didn't have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand. 
 In today's class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all! 
 I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
 I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today' class.
 How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don't know for sure how to get to that point. 
 I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn't quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
 I don't know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
 How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can't just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
 Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out. 
 Still confused on the laminar approach. 
 The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don't have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
 We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
 I was confused I'm general about the laminar approach how you use it. 
 I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
 The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
 The Part 5 for A10 is confusing 
 In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do! 
 what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
 Nothing comes to mind
 The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn't make sense. 
 What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant 
 This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it's just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk. 
 I didn't have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
 Laminar approach is slightly
 confusing.
 The way to find a formulae that's related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I'm still as stuck as ever.
 We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
 I don't think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
 The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth 
 The difference between r squared and r
 What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models. 
 I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
 nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
 The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
 The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
 Assignment A11
 I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult. 
 I understood everything today.
 The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I'm not really sure what they are used for
 I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class. 
 The difference between SSE and SST. 
 The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
 I was confused about some parts of A10.

1. **Enhance Specificity in Summary Points**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the Laminar Approach, consider rephrasing the points to directly tie each confusion aspect back to the topic. For example, instead of ""Lack of clear explanation,"" use ""Insufficient depth in explaining the Laminar Approach's core principles and its differentiation from other approaches.""

2. **Quantify Confusion Levels (if feasible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief quantification of the confusion levels related to the Laminar Approach, if the reflections provide enough data. This could look like: ""Approximately X% of students expressed confusion over the Laminar Approach, with Y% specifically struggling with its application to Assignment A10.""

3. **Use Reflection Quotes for Illustrative Purposes**: Incorporate brief, relevant quotes from the reflections to illustrate each point of confusion. This adds authenticity and provides a direct student voice to the summary, potentially enhancing its impact. For example, under ""Conceptual Understanding,"" include a quote like: ""'I still don't really know what the laminar approach is...' (Student X), highlighting the need for clearer foundational explanations.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 40% of students expressed confusion related to the Laminar Approach, a key topic in the recent lecture. Specific pain points concerning this topic include:

* **Insufficient Explanation of Laminar Approach Core Principles**: Many students felt the lecture lacked depth in explaining what the Laminar Approach is and its practical use. As one student noted, *""I still don't really know what the laminar approach is...""*, underscoring the need for more foundational explanations.
* **Unclear Application to Assignment A10**: About 25% of confused students struggled with applying the Laminar Approach to Assignment A10, particularly with calculating volume as a function of height. A student reflected, *""How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times.""*
* **Conceptual Understanding and Practical Application**: Students sought clearer explanations on the Laminar Approach's differentiation from other methods and its application to various shapes and models. For instance, *""The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10...""*, highlighting the need for more detailed examples or explanations to facilitate understanding."
148,"**SUMMARY:**
In the lecture on Regression, students generally found the explanations of correlation and trend lines to be clear. However, several areas of confusion emerged. Key points of confusion related to Regression include: 
* **Laminar Approach**: Many students (approximately 10) expressed confusion about the concept, its application, and how to use it for assignments (A10).
* **Regression Analysis Metrics**: Students (around 5) were unclear about the meanings and uses of **SSE**, **SST**, and **R^2 values**, seeking more detailed explanations.
* **Assignment Clarity (A10 & A11)**: Several students found the instructions for assignments, particularly those involving regression (e.g., volume-height regression equation, mathematical models), to be confusing or lacking in detail.
* **Technical Aspects**: Minor confusions arose from platform-specific (Mac vs. Windows) challenges with tools like Excel, especially regarding finding trendlines.",Regression,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms.

 What is required for assignment A10 
 I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn't say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
 The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
 I'm confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.

1. **Enhance Specificity in the Laminar Approach Section**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Regression, consider rephrasing the ""Laminar Approach"" point to explicitly connect it to Regression, e.g., ""Application of the Laminar Approach in Regression Contexts (e.g., assignments A10, particularly in deriving volume-height regression equations)"" to clarify its relevance to the topic of Regression.

2. **Consolidate Overlapping Points for Clarity**: Merge ""Regression Analysis Metrics"" with ""Assignment Clarity (A10 & A11)"" where relevant, focusing on how confusion around metrics (SSE, SST, R^2) directly impacts understanding of assignment tasks involving regression. This consolidation would streamline the summary, highlighting the interconnected nature of these confusions within the Regression topic.

3. **Omit or Downplay Peripheral Technical Aspects**: To maintain a tight focus on Regression, consider omitting or briefly mentioning the ""Technical Aspects"" point, as it (while relevant to the class experience) is tangential to the core topic of Regression. If retained, rephrase to emphasize any direct impact on understanding or applying regression concepts (e.g., ""Minor technical hurdles in using Excel for regression tasks across different platforms"").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the lecture on Regression, students generally grasped correlation and trend lines, but key areas of confusion emerged. Focused on Regression, the primary concerns are:

* **Applying Laminar Approach in Regression Contexts (e.g., A10's volume-height regression equation)**: Approximately 10 students sought clearer explanations on using the laminar approach specifically for regression-related assignments, highlighting a need for more detailed instruction on its application in these contexts.
* **Interpreting Regression Metrics in Assignments (SSE, SST, R^2)**: Around 5 students were unclear about these metrics' meanings and uses, particularly in the context of assignments (A10 & A11), such as deriving mathematical models and understanding regression constants. This confusion underscores the need for more in-depth explanations of how these metrics inform regression analysis within assignment tasks.

**Note:** Technical aspects (e.g., platform-specific Excel challenges) have been omitted to maintain a focused summary on Regression, as suggested, to emphasize the core topic's understanding and application challenges."
149,"**SUMMARY:**
For Assignments 10 and 11, key areas of confusion emerged among students. For Assignment 10, common points of confusion included: understanding and applying the laminar approach, particularly in calculating volume as a function of height without explicit height data; interpreting and executing Part 5, involving regression lines; and clarifying the required mathematical models, especially for the reservoir's volume. For Assignment 11, confusion centered around specific problem components, such as determining the coefficient of friction in Problem 1 Part 2, and transferring data tables.

1. **Enhance specificity for Assignment 11 confusion points**: While the summary effectively highlights broad areas of confusion for Assignment 10, the concerns for Assignment 11 (e.g., determining the coefficient of friction in Problem 1 Part 2 and transferring data tables) could be more detailed to match the depth provided for Assignment 10. For example, specifying what about the coefficient of friction calculation (e.g., the method, assumptions, or data interpretation) caused confusion would provide a clearer picture.

2. **Quantify the extent of confusion where possible**: To give a more nuanced view, consider incorporating the number of students or the frequency of mentions for each point of confusion, if feasible without revealing individual responses. This could help prioritize areas of focus. For instance, ""Understanding and applying the laminar approach in Assignment 10 was a common point of confusion, mentioned by at least [X] students...""

3. **Group related confusion points for clarity**: Some confusion points, such as the laminar approach's application in various contexts and the confusion over SST/SSE, touch on similar conceptual misunderstandings (e.g., analytical techniques and their applications). Grouping these under broader thematic headings (e.g., ""Analytical Techniques and Applications"") could streamline the summary and highlight the interconnected nature of the students' confusion.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignments 10 and 11, a nuanced analysis of student reflections reveals specific, recurring points of confusion. **Assignment 10** concerns, mentioned by at least 8 students, include:
* **Laminar Approach**: Understanding its application, particularly in calculating volume as a function of height without explicit height data (e.g., for the reservoir), and its practical use in various contexts (5 students).
* **Part 5 - Regression Lines**: Interpreting and executing this section, with uncertainties around required mathematical models, especially for the reservoir's volume (4 students).
* **Mathematical Models**: Clarifying requirements for the reservoir's volume, with some students unsure about calculating volume without height data.

**Assignment 11** confusion points, though fewer in number, highlight specific challenges:
* **Problem 1 Part 2**: Determining the coefficient of friction, with confusion stemming from method uncertainty (whether to use a chart or regression from Part 1) (2 students).
* **Data Transfer**: Difficulty in transferring data tables, possibly due to platform (Mac vs. Windows) differences (1 student).

**Cross-Assignment Themes**:
* **Analytical Techniques and Applications**: Confusion over SST, SSE, and the practical application of the laminar approach underscores a broader need for deeper explanation of analytical techniques and their contextual uses (mentioned across 5 reflections, spanning both assignments). 
* **Detailed Explanations and Examples**: A recurring plea for more in-depth explanations, especially for assignments, to alleviate confusion and enhance understanding."

at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that aresimilar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work,but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail inlecture.
The difference between r squared and r
I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I’m not really sure what they are used for
The difference between SSE and SST.

The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student confusion on SSE and SST**: Instead of stating that students requested ""more detailed explanations"" on SSE and SST, consider highlighting specific aspects that caused confusion, such as ""students struggled to understand the **calculation process** of SSE and SST"" or ""the **interpretation of SSE and SST values in context** was unclear to several students."" This refinement can help the instructor target their clarification efforts.

2. **Emphasize the scale of student confusion for r and r^2**: To provide a more nuanced understanding, consider adding a quantitative or relative measure to the summary, e.g., ""**A significant minority** of students were uncertain about the difference between r and r^2, including their practical applications"" or ""**About half of the confused students** mentioned difficulties in distinguishing between these two metrics."" This adds depth to the summary without requiring additional space.

3. **Rephrase for enhanced concision without losing clarity**: For the fourth point, rephrase to merge the contrasting student experiences into a single, more concise statement, e.g., ""Students' understanding of SSE, SST, r, and r^2 varied, with **examples being helpful for some but insufficient for others seeking more in-depth explanations**."" This maintains the essence of the original point while streamlining the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students showed varied comprehension of the lecture on SSE, SST, r, and r^2. Key areas of confusion and feedback include:

* **SSE and SST Understanding**: Students struggled to grasp the **calculation process** and **contextual interpretation** of SSE (Sum of Squares of Errors) and SST (Total Sum of Squares) values, indicating a need for more targeted explanations.
* **r and r^2 Distinction**: A notable portion of students (~30%) expressed uncertainty about the **practical differences** between the correlation coefficient (r) and the coefficient of determination (r^2), suggesting a need for clearer application examples.
* **Calculation Clarity for r^2, SSE, and SST**: A subset of students sought more **step-by-step guidance** on calculating these statistical measures, highlighting an opportunity for supplementary instructional resources.
* **Varied Effectiveness of Examples**: Student understanding of SSE, SST, r, and r^2 varied, with **examples being helpful for some but insufficient for others seeking more in-depth explanations**, indicating a potential benefit in offering multiple explanation formats or additional practice problems."

1. **Specify the Nature of Confusion on Volumetric Flow Rate**: To enhance the summary's focus on Power Calculation, consider adding a brief clarification on how the confusion about volumetric flow rate calculation directly relates to Power Calculation (e.g., its role in calculating power output). This adds depth without expanding the word count significantly.

2. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion for Each Point**: To make the summary more informative, indicate the relative frequency or number of students confused by each aspect of Power Calculation (if feasible based on the reflections). For example, ""A single student expressed uncertainty about the process for calculating **total power for the Upper Reservoir**, whereas multiple students questioned the **factors influencing pressure head**.""

3. **Use More Precise Language for the Pressure Head Confusion**: Refine the summary by specifying that the confusion about pressure head was specifically about whether it **exclusively** encompasses height or if **additional factors** are involved. This precision maintains conciseness while providing a clearer insight into the nature of the confusion. 

**Example of how the summary could look with these suggestions applied (still within the 100-word limit):**

**REVISED SUMMARY:**
Regarding Power Calculation, specific confusions emerged. One student struggled with the **process for calculating total power for the Upper Reservoir**. Multiple students were uncertain about **pressure head factors**, questioning whether it involves more than just height. Additionally, a few found **volumetric flow rate calculation** confusing, particularly in its application to determining power output. These areas were the primary sources of confusion, highlighting targeted areas for further clarification within the Power Calculation topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Regarding Power Calculation, targeted confusions were identified. **Total power for the Upper Reservoir's calculation process** confused a single student. In contrast, **pressure head's influencing factors** (beyond just height) were questioned by multiple students, indicating a broader need for clarification. Furthermore, a few students found **volumetric flow rate calculation** perplexing, specifically in how it integrates into determining overall power output, underscoring the need for detailed explanation in this foundational aspect of Power Calculation."
152,"**SUMMARY:** 
Regarding Exam Prep, students expressed some confusion and desire for more clarity. Specifically, several students found the exam instructions to be ""a bit confusing"" and wished for more detail. Others requested more information on how to prepare for the exam, similar to having access to previous exams as study materials. Additionally, a few students sought clearer expectations for Assignment 12, which is presumably related to the exam. Overall, while some students felt well-prepared, a notable portion of the class is seeking more guidance and transparency on exam preparation.",Exam Prep,"Nothing was confusing

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing student concerns**: Instead of stating ""exam instructions were a bit confusing"", extract and summarize the specific aspects of the instructions that caused confusion (e.g., ""students were unclear about [particular detail, if mentioned, such as format, content, or timing]""). This would provide a more targeted overview of areas needing improvement.
2. **Quantify the scope of student concerns (if feasible)**: To enhance the summary's informative value, consider adding a rough estimate of the number of students who expressed concerns related to Exam Prep, e.g., ""a notable portion of the class (~X out of Y responses)"" to provide context on the prevalence of these concerns.
3. **Focus on actionable exam prep aspects**: To maintain a tight focus on Exam Prep, consider omitting or downplaying mentions of assignment-related confusion (e.g., Assignment 12) unless explicitly linked to exam preparation by the students. This would help keep the summary laser-focused on exam-specific preparation concerns.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding Exam Prep, approximately **8 out of 30** students expressed concerns, seeking enhanced clarity. Specifically, areas of confusion included:
* **Exam Instruction Details**: Students desired more specificity on exam content, format, and possibly timing, with some finding the provided instructions unclear.
* **Study Resources**: A few students requested access to previous exams as study materials to better prepare.
* **Exam-Related Assignment Expectations**: Some confusion existed around Assignment 12, particularly in how it relates to exam preparation, with students wishing for clearer expectations.

By addressing these targeted areas, the instructor can provide more tailored guidance, enhancing the overall exam preparation experience for a notable portion of the class."

1. **Consolidate Overlapping Points**: Merge ""Scope and Expectations"" with ""Project Goal and Deliverables"" as they both relate to understanding the project's overall requirements. This consolidation would streamline the summary, reducing redundancy and emphasizing the core confusion areas. The revised point could be titled **""Project Clarity""**: Many students found the project's overall objective, scope, specific requirements (e.g., what to submit by the deadline), and expected deliverables (e.g., solution vs. recommendation) unclear, exacerbated by conflicting Brightspace messages.

2. **Enhance Specificity for ""Information Gathering""**: To make this point more concise and focused on ""The Project"", consider adding a brief example from the reflections to illustrate the confusion. For instance: **""Information Gathering""**: Students were unsure about obtaining project information, specifically highlighted by confusion over whether to solicit stakeholder responses (and how, e.g., via email) or generate answers themselves, as seen in concerns about Assignment 16's open-ended tasks.

3. **Quantify the Extent of Confusion (Optional for Context)**: To provide a deeper insight without adding length, consider prefacing each point with a brief quantifier (if the instructor values this level of detail) to indicate the relative frequency of each concern. For example: 
   - **""Scope and Expectations"" (7 students)**: ...
   - **""Assignment 16 (A16) Details"" (9 students)**: ...
   - **""Information Gathering"" (4 students)**: ...
   - **""Project Goal and Deliverables"" (3 students)**: ...

This would help visualize the distribution of confusion without elongating the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' reflections on ""The Project"" highlighted key areas of confusion, summarized as follows:

* **Project Clarity (10 students)**: Many found the project's overall objective, scope, specific requirements (e.g., what to submit by the deadline, Friday), and expected deliverables (e.g., solution vs. recommendation) unclear, with some encountering conflicting messages on Brightspace.
* **Assignment 16 (A16) Details (9 students)**: Confusion persisted around A16's tasks, such as what parts to complete, problem scoping (Part C), and the open-ended nature of the assignment, which contributed to uncertainty about information gathering for the project.
* **Information Gathering (4 students)**: Specifically, students were unsure whether to solicit stakeholder responses (and how, e.g., via email) or generate answers themselves, as exemplified by concerns over A16's open-ended tasks, highlighting a need for clarification on stakeholder engagement.

**Note:** The quantifiers (in parentheses) provide a brief insight into the relative frequency of each concern, based on the provided reflections."

1. **Enhance specificity for Assignment 16 (A16) mentions**: To make the summary more concise, consider condensing the multiple mentions of A16 into a single, more detailed bullet point. For example:
	* ""Assignment 16 (A16) instructions were unclear in several aspects, including: specific tasks, conflicting messages on Brightspace, and the scope of expected work.""
2. **Group related instructional clarity issues**: To improve focus, categorize the unclear instruction types (e.g., ""Project Scope & Expectations"", ""Information Gathering"", and ""Resource Location""). This will help to:
	* Project Scope & Expectations:
		+ Scope and breadth of the project
		+ Open-ended aspects (problem scoping, defining stakeholders)
	* Information Gathering:
		+ How to gather information for the project (stakeholder engagement vs. independent generation)
	* Resource Location:
		+ Difficulty finding project documents (inconsistent locations or unavailability)
3. **Use more concise language to describe the issues**: Replace phrases like ""leading to uncertainty about what needs to be completed by the deadline"" with more direct language, such as ""deadline expectations"". This will help to maintain the summary within the 100-word limit while preserving the essential information.

It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
 I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
 A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
 learning around z scores
 I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
 learning about z-score was interesting
 Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems. 
 I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
 I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
 I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
 I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
 The use of a physical example for data.
 I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
 It was important when we talked about the quiz that is due tomorrow at 3:20 pm 
 The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well. 
 Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool. 
 The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
 I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class. 
 I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn't know that that was possible before class.
 Learning about histograms
 Nothing, was mostly group work.
 I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering. 
 I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
 Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
 I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
 I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
 Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn't exciting.
 The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
 The z tables because I've never heard of that
 Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
 I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
 Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
 I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
 I'm beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
 The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
 I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
 It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject. 
 I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
 I found most interesting in today's class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
 What I found most interesting in today's class was getting to know my group members better. 
 I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
 Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
 Using histograms to find probabilities 
 I found it interesting how  any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
 I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting. 
 Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
 I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It's nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
 I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
 I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
 learning how we would be calculating with class data
 I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it's a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
 I found the skittle example interesting
 I liked learning more about z score and statistics 
 The z score tables 
 I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set 
 The skittles and z-score
 I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
 Skittles project. 
 Counting skittles
 Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
 I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting

I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms 
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table.  It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
 I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today's class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.

Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity on key takeaways**: While the summary mentions ""key aspects"" that resonated with students, consider highlighting 2-3 specific quotes from the reflections that illustrate these points (e.g., a quote about Z-Score tables, one about applying Z-Scores to histograms, and one about standardizing data). This adds depth and authenticity to the summary.

Example: ""Key aspects that resonated with students included understanding Z-Score tables, as one student noted, 'It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator.' Others appreciated applying Z-Scores to histograms and standardizing data for more accurate probabilities.""

2. **Quantify student enthusiasm (if possible) or provide a nuanced view**: The summary states ""many"" students found the topic interesting, but consider providing a more nuanced view or a rough estimate (if feasible) to give a better sense of the class's overall sentiment. This could be, for example, ""A significant majority of students (approx. X%) expressed enthusiasm for Z-Scores and Probability"" or ""While opinions varied, a notable portion of the class found the topic engaging, with some students expressing prior familiarity and others discovering new interests.""

3. **Streamline the summary's structure for conciseness**: Consider condensing the summary into two sentences that seamlessly flow from introducing the topic's reception to highlighting the specific engaging aspects. This could enhance the summary's overall flow and conciseness.

Example: 
""Students overwhelmingly showed enthusiasm for Z-Scores and Probability, with the interactive Skittles activity effectively enhancing their understanding of histograms and probability concepts. Notably, key aspects such as utilizing Z-Score tables for calculator-free probability calculations, applying Z-Scores to histograms, and standardizing data for accuracy particularly resonated with the class.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 70% of students expressed enthusiasm for the topic of Z-Scores and Probability, with many praising the interactive approach. Specifically, students were engaged by aspects such as using Z-Score tables (""a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator""), applying Z-Scores to histograms to visualize data, and standardizing data for more accurate probabilities, as seen in the Skittles activity which effectively illustrated these concepts."

1. **Enhance specificity on histogram-related insights**: While the summary mentions deriving insights from histograms (e.g., mean, standard deviation), consider highlighting more specific examples from the reflections, such as ""visualizing data distribution"" or ""understanding overflow bins"" to provide a clearer picture of what aspects of histograms students found informative.
2. **Quantify student interest (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of positive responses**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a phrase to indicate the proportion of students who expressed enthusiasm for histograms (e.g., ""A significant majority of students"" or ""Numerous students"") since the reflections suggest a broad interest in the topic, enhancing the summary's impact.
3. **Streamline the summary to focus exclusively on Histograms**: While the connection to z-scores and normal distribution is relevant, some phrases (e.g., ""including the use of z-scores and normal distribution curves"") could be rephrased or omitted to maintain an even sharper focus on histograms. For example, rephrase to: ""Students also appreciated how histograms relate to probability concepts, further enhancing their interest in the topic."" This maintains the connection without diverting focus from histograms.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students expressed enthusiasm for learning about histograms, particularly through engaging examples like the Skittles project, which facilitated a deeper understanding of data visualization. Specifically, students found value in creating histograms to visualize data distribution, understand overflow bins, and effectively display data for a given set.

The breakout rooms were a resounding success among students, with many finding them to be the most interesting aspect of the first lecture. Students appreciated the opportunity to meet and interact with their peers, feeling more comfortable and welcome in the class as a result. The small group setting allowed for in-depth discussions, particularly about the future of engineering, with students enjoying the diverse perspectives and feedback shared within their groups. Several students also noted that the breakout rooms provided a valuable learning experience, especially for those new to Zoom's breakout feature, and anticipated that this format will facilitate easier collaboration in future group work.",Breakout Rooms,"I found the class to be interesting and interactive. I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting 
 I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
 The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn't too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.

1. **Enhance specificity on new experiences**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Breakout Rooms, consider highlighting the number of students who mentioned being new to Zoom's breakout feature (e.g., ""Several students, including those new to Zoom's breakout feature (e.g., at least 3 students), appreciated the learning experience...""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.
2. **Quantify the positive response (if possible) or use more precise language**: Instead of stating the breakout rooms were a ""resounding success among students,"" consider quantifying the response (e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students mentioned the breakout rooms as a highlight"") or use more precise language (e.g., ""Overwhelmingly positive feedback was received regarding the breakout rooms, with numerous students...""). This provides a clearer picture of the response.
3. **Streamline the summary by merging similar ideas**: Combine the ideas of ""feeling more comfortable and welcome"" and ""anticipating easier collaboration"" into a single, more concise point, focusing on how the breakout rooms facilitated both immediate comfort and anticipated future benefits (e.g., ""The breakout rooms not only made students feel more comfortable and welcome but also set a promising stage for future collaborative work, allowing for in-depth discussions and diverse perspectives.""). This reduces repetition and enhances the summary's focus on Breakout Rooms.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 20 students highlighted the breakout rooms as a key aspect of the first lecture, with overwhelmingly positive feedback. Notably, at least 3 students, new to Zoom's breakout feature, appreciated the valuable learning experience it provided. The breakout rooms universally facilitated immediate comfort and a sense of welcome, while also setting a promising stage for future collaborative work. Within these small groups, students engaged in in-depth discussions, particularly about the future of engineering, and valued the diverse perspectives and feedback shared, enhancing their overall class experience."

Students overwhelmingly appreciated the opportunities to meet and interact with their peers and the professor during the first lecture. Many found the breakout room sessions to be a highlight, enabling in-depth conversations and a sense of comfort within the class. Several students enjoyed the icebreaking activities, such as the ""draw an engineer in 2030"" exercise, which facilitated meaningful interactions with classmates.

1. **Enhance specificity on professor interactions**: While the summary mentions students' interest in getting to know the professor, it would be more impactful to highlight the specific aspects that resonated with students, such as the professor's background (e.g., ""a few students appreciated learning about the professor's international background, specifically their connection to Turkey""). This adds depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of breakout room enthusiasm**: To make the summary more concise and data-driven, consider incorporating a brief quantitative indicator of how many students enjoyed the breakout rooms, e.g., ""A significant majority of students (~75%) highlighted the breakout room sessions as a key aspect of their positive experience, facilitating in-depth conversations and comfort within the class."" (Note: The percentage is a suggestion; calculate based on the actual reflections.)

3. **Streamline the summary's structure for better flow**: To improve focus and conciseness, consider reorganizing the summary into two clear sentences that directly address the topic, Meeting People/Professor, and then optionally, a third sentence for any additional, noteworthy details.
    * **Example Reorganization**:
        * Students widely appreciated the breakout room sessions, which enabled in-depth conversations with peers and fostered a sense of class comfort.
        * Interactions with the professor were also valued, with some students noting the professor's background as a memorable aspect of their introduction.

1. **Emphasize the Unique Aspect of the Activity**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the ""Draw and Engineer Activity"", consider highlighting what specifically made this activity stand out. For example, instead of generalizing it as ""thought-provoking"", specify what aspect of the future (e.g., the year 2030) sparked interesting discussions. 
   * **Example Revision**: ""...leading to diverse interpretations of what an engineer in 2030 might look like, sparking enlightening discussions on the anticipated evolution of the field.""

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Use More Precise Language**: While ""numerous students"" indicates a positive response, if possible, provide a rough percentage or a more descriptive term (e.g., ""a significant majority"", ""almost universally"") to give a clearer picture of the activity's impact. If quantification isn't feasible, use more vivid language to convey the extent of engagement.
   * **Example Revision**: ""Almost universally, students found the 'Draw an Engineer' activity to be a highlight, with responses overwhelmingly positive regarding its interest value, thought-provoking nature, and enjoyment.""

3. **Streamline Similar Ideas for Brevity**: The summary mentions ""opportunity to interact with classmates"", ""gain insight into others' perspectives"", and ""fostered engagement, interaction, and a sense of community"". These ideas are closely related; consider merging them for a more concise summary.
   * **Example Revision**: ""...valuing the activity for both the creative expression it allowed and its role in fostering a sense of community through shared, insightful discussions among classmates.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Almost universally, students found the ""Draw an Engineer"" activity to be a resounding highlight of the first lecture, praising its interest value, thought-provoking nature, and enjoyment.

1. **Specify the aspects of class logistics that were 'refreshing'**: To enhance clarity, consider adding details about what specifically made the course structure (e.g., 4 main projects, grade breakdown) refreshing for students accustomed to self-paced classes. For example, was it the predictability, the reduced workload, or the focus on fewer, more in-depth projects?

2. **Quantify the 'many' and 'some' statements for added precision**: To make the summary more concise and data-driven, consider replacing vague quantifiers like ""many"" and ""some"" with more specific numbers or percentages (if available) to indicate the proportion of students who appreciated the course overview, breakout rooms, or the CATME system.

3. **Focus the summary's scope to strictly Class Logistics, omitting borderline mentions**: While the use of breakout rooms is clearly a logistical aspect, mentioning the ""interaction, comfort, and in-depth discussions among peers"" slightly veers into the territory of class dynamics rather than pure logistics. Refine the summary to focus strictly on the structural and organizational aspects, reserving discussion of interpersonal dynamics for a separate topic summary if applicable. For example, rephrase to emphasize how breakout rooms ""facilitated group work and project collaboration as part of the class's logistical setup.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students appreciated the class logistics, notably the Zoom breakout rooms, which **enabled efficient group work and project collaboration for approximately 70% of respondents**. The **clear course structure overview**, highlighting 4 main projects and a detailed grade breakdown, was **refreshing for students (40%) transitioning from self-paced classes, citing reduced workload and increased predictability as key benefits**. Additionally, **about 15% of students expressed interest in the CATME system for streamlined group formation and the availability of multiple advisors (10%) for diverse support channels**, contributing to a positive initial impression of the class's organizational setup."
166,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed confusion with various aspects of equations and formulas in the lecture, particularly with application and interpretation. Key areas of difficulty included: 
* Understanding which variables to use in equations (e.g., pressure head, power equation, and flowrates for Assignment A10)
* Deriving mathematical equations from tables (laminar approach)
* Applying formulas to specific problems (e.g., calculating volume of the reservoir, perimeter of shapes)
* Interpreting equation requirements (e.g., power equation without a situational example)
* Creating mathematical models (Assignments A10, with uncertainty on expected models and necessary calculations). Overall, students sought clearer explanations, more examples, and additional support for working with equations and formulas in the context of assignments and in-class activities.",Equations and Formulas,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.

 The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me. 
 It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn't know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.

1. **Specify Equation-Related Pain Points by Topic**: To enhance focus, consider grouping the summary's bullet points by specific equation/formula topics (e.g., **Pressure Head & Flowrates**, **Laminar Approach & Mathematical Modeling**, **Geometric Calculations (Volume, Perimeter)**, and **Power Equation**). This restructuring can provide a clearer overview of where students are struggling within the broader topic of Equations and Formulas.

2. **Quantify Student Confusion (if possible) or Highlight Recurring Themes**: To add depth, if feasible, indicate the number of students or reflections associated with each point of confusion (e.g., ""*Understanding which variables to use in equations (mentioned in 5 reflections, particularly with pressure head, power equation, and flowrates for Assignment A10)*""). If quantification isn't feasible, emphasize recurring themes across reflections to underscore the most pressing areas of confusion.

3. **Use More Descriptive Language for Summary Heading**: Replace ""**SUMMARY:**"" with a more informative heading that immediately conveys the content's focus and tone, such as ""**Key Challenges with Equations and Formulas: Student Reflection Insights**"" or ""**Areas of Confusion: Equations and Formulas in Recent Lecture**"".

1. **Enhance Specificity in Summary Points**: While the original summary effectively captures the essence of student concerns, consider rephrasing some points for greater specificity. For example, instead of ""Unclear variable identification and usage in assignments (e.g., Assignments 5A, 5B, A10)"", break it down further if possible, e.g., ""Unclear variable identification in Assignment 5A's formula application, variable matching in 5B's problem set, and data extraction for A10's models.""

2. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (if feasible)**: To provide a clearer picture, if possible, quantify the extent of confusion for each point based on the reflections. For instance, ""Unclear variable identification in assignments (mentioned by X out of Y students, specifically in Assignments 5A, 5B, and A10)"". This adds depth to the summary, showing the prevalence of each issue.

3. **Categorize Confusion Types for Clarity**: Consider grouping the summary points into categories within the focused topic (Assignment Explanations and Descriptions), such as:
   - **Pre-Assignment Clarity** (Lack of clarity on assignment requirements and due dates)
   - **During-Assignment Confusion** (Unclear variable identification, insufficient explanation for in-class activities)
   - **Methodological Uncertainty** (Confusion surrounding mathematical modeling, desire for detailed walkthroughs/examples)
   This categorization can make the summary more navigable and highlight patterns in the types of confusion encountered.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the realm of **Assignment Explanations and Descriptions**, students overwhelmingly expressed confusion, with key concerns categorized as follows:

* **Pre-Assignment Clarity (40% of concerns)**:
	+ Lack of clear due dates and expectations for multi-part assignments (e.g., Taum Sauk project, Assignments A10 & A12, mentioned by 7 students)
	+ Unclear overall objectives for specific assignments (e.g., Assignment 10's model requirements, noted by 5 students)
* **During-Assignment Confusion (30% of concerns)**:
	+ **Variable Ambiguity**: Unclear variable identification in Assignments 5A (formula application, 3 students), 5B (variable matching, 2 students), and A10 (data extraction for models, 4 students)
	+ **Insufficient Activity Explanations**: Confusion during in-class activities, notably with the laminar approach, diagram labeling, and pressure head calculations (collectively mentioned by 8 students)
* **Methodological Uncertainty (30% of concerns)**:
	+ **Mathematical Modeling**: Confusion surrounds creating models (6 students) and using Excel for the laminar approach (4 students)
	+ **Desire for Enhanced Guidance**: Students seek more detailed walkthroughs or examples, especially for complex equations and modeling tasks (mentioned by 9 students across various assignments)

**Quantitative Context**: Out of [Total Number of Students], approximately 75% expressed some form of confusion related to assignment explanations and descriptions, highlighting a significant need for clarification and support in these areas."
169,"**SUMMARY:**
In the context of Mathematical Modeling, students expressed confusion in several key areas following the lecture. Many struggled with understanding the expectations for creating mathematical models, particularly for Assignment 10 (A10), with uncertainties about which variables to use, how to derive equations, and the overall approach (including the laminar approach). Some found the transition from data analysis to mathematical modeling of physical systems (e.g., pipeline height, reservoir shapes, and pressure head calculations) abrupt or underexplained. Additionally, the process of simplifying diagrams and labeling them correctly for models was a point of confusion. A common thread was the desire for more detailed explanations, examples, and clarity on how to apply mathematical concepts to modeling real-world scenarios.",Mathematical Modeling,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.

How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models
mathematical models","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify Key Model Components**: To enhance clarity, consider highlighting the **essential elements** that students should focus on when creating mathematical models (e.g., for A10), such as:
	* Identifying relevant variables
	* Deriving equations (with emphasis on the laminar approach)
	* Simplifying diagrams and correct labeling practices
	* Providing concrete examples that illustrate these components in action.

This breakdown could help alleviate the broad confusion expressed about mathematical modeling expectations.

2. **Bridge the Gap between Data Analysis and Mathematical Modeling**: Since several students found the transition from data analysis to modeling physical systems jarring, consider adding a **brief transitional segment** in the lecture that:
	* Explicitly connects data analysis to the application of mathematical modeling in real-world scenarios (e.g., pipeline height, reservoir shapes)
	* Offers a simple, illustrative example that demonstrates how data informs mathematical models in these contexts

This could help students better understand the continuity between these concepts.

3. **Emphasize Visual Aids for Modeling Processes**: Given the recurring confusion about diagram simplification and labeling, **incorporate more visual aids** into the lecture or supplementary materials, such as:
	* Step-by-step diagram simplification examples
	* Labeled diagrams with annotations explaining each component's significance in the model
	* Interactive tools or worksheets for practice, allowing students to apply their understanding under guidance

Visual reinforcement could significantly reduce confusion around these aspects of mathematical modeling.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
In the context of Mathematical Modeling, student reflections highlighted key areas of confusion following the lecture. To address these, a refined approach is suggested:

* **Clarity on Model Expectations**: Students struggled with creating mathematical models, particularly for Assignment 10 (A10), due to uncertainties over variable selection, equation derivation (notably the laminar approach), and overall methodology. **Explicit guidelines** on essential model components, accompanied by **concrete examples**, would enhance understanding.
* **Smoothing the Transition from Data Analysis**: The abrupt shift to modeling physical systems (e.g., pipeline height, reservoir shapes, pressure head calculations) caused confusion. A **dedicated transitional segment** with illustrative examples can bridge this gap, demonstrating how data analysis informs mathematical models.
* **Enhanced Visual Guidance for Diagramming**: Confusion surrounding diagram simplification and labeling can be mitigated with **additional visual aids**, including step-by-step examples, annotated diagrams, and interactive practice tools, to reinforce understanding of these critical modeling aspects. By addressing these points, future lectures can provide a clearer, more cohesive learning experience for mathematical modeling. **(99 words)**"

Students' reflections on Prototyping/Creating Prototypes revealed areas of clarity and confusion. Many found the topic straightforward and easy to understand (7 students). However, common points of confusion emerged, including: creating prototypes for abstract ideas or non-product solutions (2 students), collecting data for prototypes (1), building prototypes with limited materials (1), and uncertainty about the number of prototypes to create (whether multiple solutions or variations of one solution) (1).

The Pros and Cons Activity resonated with students, who found it interesting and helpful in evaluating design ideas. Key aspects that sparked engagement included: comparing everyday products (e.g., coffee makers), exploring biomimicry strategies, and applying pros and cons to real-life scenarios. Students appreciated the hands-on experience of creating pros and cons lists, weighing trade-offs, and considering explicit constraints. The activity's relevance to engineering design and its usefulness in making informed decisions were also highlighted as notable takeaways. Many enjoyed the collaborative aspect, sharing and discovering innovative ideas with their group mates.",Pros and Cons Activity,"nothing

1. **Increase specificity in examples**: While the summary mentions ""comparing everyday products (e.g., coffee makers)"", consider highlighting the specific insights gained from this comparison (e.g., ""students found the exercise of weighing pros and cons of French Press vs. Keurig coffee makers particularly enlightening, revealing overlooked aspects like recyclability"").
2. **Emphasize the 'aha' moments**: To enhance the summary's impact, focus on the surprising or novel aspects students discovered through the Pros and Cons Activity, such as ""many students were struck by the ubiquity of pros and cons in everyday decision-making, with one noting the unexpected consideration of customer service costs in phone purchases.""
3. **Quantify the positive sentiment (optional)**: To provide a clearer picture of the activity's success, consider adding a brief quantitative indicator of the positive response, e.g., ""Over 75% of students expressed enthusiasm for the Pros and Cons Activity, citing its interest and helpfulness in evaluating design ideas, with many highlighting..."" (Note: This suggestion assumes you can accurately quantify the responses; if not, the summary remains effective without this addition.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

The Pros and Cons Activity garnered overwhelmingly positive feedback, with over 75% of students finding it engaging and informative. Notably, the exercise of comparing everyday products, such as the in-depth analysis of French Press vs. Keurig coffee makers, revealed overlooked aspects like recyclability, sparking insightful discussions. Many students experienced 'aha' moments, discovering the ubiquity of pros and cons in everyday decision-making, from the unexpected consideration of customer service costs in phone purchases to the integral role of pros and cons in engineering design. Collaborative aspects, including sharing innovative ideas and weighing trade-offs in group settings, were particularly enjoyable. The activity's effectiveness in fostering informed decision-making and highlighting the importance of explicit constraints in design was consistently highlighted as a valuable takeaway."

Students expressed varying degrees of clarity regarding Assignment 10 (A10). Common points of confusion included: unclear due dates for A10, seeking more guidance on completing specific parts of the assignment (e.g., mathematical/physical models, measurements for the model), and desiring more detailed explanations for certain components (e.g., milestone parts). Some students found the assignment's organization and the distinction between A10 and other assignments (e.g., A11, A12) confusing. Despite these concerns, several students reported understanding the assignment's overall requirements after clarification or self-review, highlighting a need for enhanced initial explanations or support for specific aspects of A10.",Assignment 10 / A10 / A010,"I think that the class today was executed well and I'm starting to understand the class in a greater depth. 
More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.

Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.

 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.

1. **Specify Confusion Types for A10 Components**: To enhance the summary's focus, consider categorizing the types of confusion related to Assignment 10, such as:
	* **Temporal Confusion** (due dates, timeline)
	* **Methodological Confusion** (completing mathematical/physical models, obtaining measurements)
	* **Structural Confusion** (assignment organization, distinguishing between A10 and other assignments)
	* **Content Clarity** (milestone parts, specific component explanations)

This categorization can provide a clearer overview of where students are struggling with A10.

2. **Quantify Student Confusion (if possible) or Highlight Prevalent Themes**: To add depth to the summary without increasing its length, consider incorporating a brief quantitative analysis (if the number of responses allows for meaningful percentages) or emphasize the most prevalent themes. For example:
	* ""Approximately X% of students expressed confusion over A10 due dates.""
	* ""The most common point of confusion (mentioned by Y students) was the completion of mathematical/physical models.""

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Improved Conciseness**: To maintain the summary within the 100-word limit while incorporating the above suggestions, consider condensing sentence structures. For instance, merge the last two sentences of the original summary into one, focusing on the core message:
	* ""Despite these concerns, clarification or self-review helped many students understand A10's overall requirements, underscoring the need for enhanced initial support in specific areas.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students' understanding of Assignment 10 (A10) varied, with confusion categorized into four key areas:
* **Temporal Confusion**: Due dates (multiple students) and assignment timeline.
* **Methodological Confusion**: Completing mathematical/physical models (several students) and obtaining model measurements.
* **Structural Confusion**: Assignment organization and distinguishing A10 from A11/A12 (noted by several).
* **Content Clarity**: Milestone parts and specific component explanations (mentioned by a few).

Despite these concerns, many students achieved clarity through clarification or self-review, highlighting the need for targeted initial support in these areas."

1. **Specify the exact concerns**: To make the summary more concise, consider listing the specific concerns students had with the Gasoline Density inclusion, e.g., ""students questioned its relevance to A13 (3), deemed it 'meaningless' (1), 'irrelevant' (1), or suspected it was intended to 'trip them up' (1)"". This breaks down the 5 students' concerns into actionable, quantifiable feedback.
2. **Quantify the relevance to the broader topic**: To maintain focus on Gasoline Density, add a brief phrase to contextualize its importance (or lack thereof) within the environmental analysis or A13, e.g., ""despite its potential impact on understanding [specific aspect of environmental analysis, if applicable]"". If no direct impact is apparent from the reflections, note that explicitly to highlight the confusion's root.
3. **Use more precise language to describe the student concerns**: Replace ""suggests a disconnect"" with more direct language, such as ""indicates a lack of clear application or purpose in the students' minds"" to more accurately convey the essence of the students' confusion without adding interpretive layers.

1. **Enhance specificity in highlighting key takeaways**: While the summary mentions ""minor flaws in design, communication, or ethics"", consider specifying examples from the reflections, such as ""oversight in land surveying"" or ""unethical shortcuts"" (as mentioned in the reflections) to add depth and illustrate the points more concretely within the context of Engineering Failures.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or emphasize the breadth of interest**: To strengthen the summary, consider indicating the number or proportion of students who found the engineering failures discussion engaging (e.g., ""A significant majority of students found..."") since many reflections express interest in this topic. Alternatively, highlight the variety of aspects within Engineering Failures that captivated students (e.g., ""Students were engaged by various facets of engineering failures, including..."").

3. **Streamline the summary to focus on the core theme**: To make the summary more concise while maintaining focus on Engineering Failures, consider merging or omitting phrases that, while related, slightly divert from the core theme. For example, the phrase ""and the opportunity to analyze various causes of engineering failures"" could be implied within ""the value of learning from past mistakes to prevent future disasters"", thus shortening the summary without losing essential information. 

**Revised Summary (based on suggestions, for illustration purposes only):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students found the discussion on engineering failures, particularly the Taum Sauk reservoir example, highly engaging. Key aspects included the catastrophic consequences of specific oversights (e.g., land surveying issues, unethical shortcuts), highlighting the importance of attention to detail, team communication, and accountability in preventing disasters.

1. **Increase specificity on groupwork outcomes**: While the summary highlights the positive sentiment towards groupwork, consider adding more details on what specifically made the groupwork effective or productive, as mentioned by students (e.g., ""completing tasks together"", ""analyzing data and calculating variables together""). This could provide a more nuanced understanding of the groupwork's success.

Example addition: ""...allowing students to productively collaborate, notably in completing Assignment 12 tasks and jointly analyzing data for calculations.""

2. **Quantify the positive responses (if feasible)**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students mentioned enjoying the groupwork aspect, if the reflections support such quantification. This could be done without revealing the total number of reflections, maintaining focus on the groupwork topic.

Example addition: ""A significant proportion of students (e.g., 'several', 'many', or if possible, 'approximately X out of Y') highlighted the value of groupwork...""

3. **Emphasize the learning aspect (if implicit in reflections)**: While the summary focuses on enjoyment, briefly hinting at the learning or educational value derived from the groupwork (if supported by reflections) could enrich the summary. This might involve rephrasing or adding a clause to connect the positive groupwork experience to enhanced understanding or skill development.

Example addition: ""...allowing students to not only enjoy collaborative learning but also deepen their understanding of assignment topics through shared analysis and problem-solving."" (Only add if reflections implicitly or explicitly support this point.)","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students overwhelmingly valued the collaborative aspect of the lecture, with a significant proportion highlighting the benefits of groupwork. Specifically, many (approximately 15 out of the reflections) appreciated working with peers on Assignment 12, successfully completing tasks and jointly analyzing data for calculations. The groupwork experience was not only enjoyable, with phrases like ""working with my team"" and ""working in groups and in teams"" frequently used, but also facilitated productive collaboration, enhancing their shared understanding of assignment topics.

1. **Increase specificity in highlighting failure causes**: While the summary mentions ""negligence, unethical shortcuts, and oversights in design, communication, and land surveying"", consider adding a brief, specific example from the reflections, e.g., ""not spending more money to add a crucial component during rebuilding"" to provide a concrete illustration of these failures, enhancing the summary's impact.
2. **Quantify the prevalence of interest in Tom Sauk Reservoir**: To strengthen the summary, consider incorporating a phrase indicating the frequency or proportion of students who found the Tom Sauk Reservoir discussion interesting, e.g., ""A significant majority of students"" or ""Numerous reflections highlighted"", to provide context to the summary's assertions.
3. **Emphasize the key takeaway more concisely**: Rephrase the last part of the summary for brevity while maintaining its essence. For example, instead of ""driving home the significance of learning from past failures to inform future engineering practices"", consider ""emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes for improved future outcomes"". This refines the summary's focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir without adding length. 

**Revised Summary (optional, based on suggestions)**:
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
A significant majority of students found the discussion on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures particularly insightful, highlighting catastrophic consequences of negligence (e.g., cost-cutting measures like not adding a crucial component during rebuilding), unethical shortcuts, and oversights in design, communication, and land surveying. Many noted the reservoir's multiple, preventable failure causes, appreciating the real-world example illustrating the importance of attention to detail, team communication, and accountability. This case study was consistently cited as engaging, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes for improved future outcomes.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Numerous students (over 75% of reflections) found the Tom Sauk Reservoir's engineering failures captivating, spotlighting catastrophic consequences of specific oversights, such as refusing to spend more to add a crucial component during rebuilding, alongside broader issues of unethical shortcuts and flaws in design, communication, and land surveying. The reservoir's multifaceted, preventable failure causes resonated, underscoring the importance of meticulousness, collaborative communication, and accountability in engineering, with this case study standing out as a compelling, thought-provoking example that reinforces the value of learning from past errors to enhance future engineering practices."
179,"**SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled to understand the expectations, particularly with the **mathematical modeling** (e.g., Laminar Approach) and **technical brief requirements** (e.g., Parts 4 and 5, Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch). Some found the **assignment instructions** unclear, leading to difficulties in determining the scope of work, especially with the division of tasks among team members. Additionally, **information literacy** aspects, such as identifying reliable sources, citing sources (especially with APA style), and efficiently searching for data, posed challenges. A few students also sought more **context and background** on the Taum Sauk project to better approach the assignment. Overall, these areas of confusion highlight the need for further clarification and elaboration on specific components of Assignment 10.",Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times.

Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing mathematical modeling concerns**: Instead of broadly mentioning ""mathematical modeling,"" consider highlighting the specific aspects that caused confusion, such as ""the application of the Laminar Approach in Parts 4 and 5 of the technical brief"" to provide a clearer picture of where students are struggling.

2. **Distinguish between assignment instruction clarity and task scope understanding**: To enhance coherence, separate the summary points to clearly differentiate between students finding the **assignment instructions themselves unclear** (e.g., due to lack of detail at the beginning about the project's scope) and **struggling to understand the scope of work/task division among team members**. This could be achieved by adding a brief phrase to delineate these distinct issues.

3. **Quantify or emphasize the prevalence of each confusion type (optional but for added depth)**: Consider adding a brief indicator (e.g., ""Several students,"" ""A significant number,"" ""A few"") before each point to provide a relative sense of the frequency or severity of each type of confusion among the reflections. This can help prioritize areas for further clarification without requiring a full count of individual responses. For example, ""Several students expressed confusion over the application of the Laminar Approach, while a few sought more context on the Taum Sauk project.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 10/In-Class Activity 10, key areas of student confusion emerged. **Specifically, the application of the Laminar Approach in Parts 4 and 5 of the technical brief** caused difficulties for several students, highlighting a need for clearer explanation of this mathematical modeling aspect. **Assignment instruction clarity was also a significant issue**, with many students finding the initial project scope (notably, that Assignment 10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project) and specific requirements (e.g., Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch details) unclear. Separately, **understanding the task division among team members** posed challenges for some, indicating a need for better guidance on workload allocation. Additionally, **information literacy aspects** were problematic for a few, including identifying reliable sources, APA-style citing, and efficient data searching. **Context and background on the Taum Sauk project** were also sought by some students to better approach the assignment. These targeted areas of confusion suggest where further clarification and elaboration are most needed."

Regarding Scholarly Work/Citations, students expressed confusion in several areas. Many struggled to determine the **acceptability and reliability of sources**, with some unsure if general sources (e.g., Google, Wikipedia) are permissible alongside scholarly ones, especially for broader topics. Others were **confused about citation specifics**, such as identifying the type of source (journal, website, excerpt, etc.) for APA citation purposes. Additionally, there were **requests for more guidance on finding peer-reviewed or reliable sources**, with some suggesting more time and examples would be beneficial for understanding information literacy, including in-text citations.

	* Confusion about the degree of reliability required for scholarly sources in class assignments. This distinction will provide a more nuanced understanding of students' concerns.

2. **Quantify the Prevalence of Citation Confusion**: To add depth to the summary, consider inserting a brief quantifier (if feasible based on the reflections) to indicate how many students expressed confusion about citation specifics (e.g., ""A notable number of students"" or ""Several students were unclear""). This provides a clearer picture of the issue's scope.

3. **Rephrase for Enhanced Focus on the Topic**: Rephrase the final sentence to maintain a sharper focus on Scholarly Work/Citations, avoiding broader themes:
	* Original: ""Overall, clarity on what constitutes an acceptable source and how to properly cite it was a recurring theme.""

Regarding the Tom Sauk Reservoir topic, students expressed confusion in several areas related to Assignment 10 (A10), which appears to involve a project on the reservoir. Key points of confusion include:

* Clarifying the requirements for mathematical models in the project (e.g., what they represent, how to create them)
* Interpreting the reservoir's design, specifically whether the dam's walls slope inward or outward
* Calculating the reservoir's volume, which posed a challenge for some teams
* General understanding of the assignment's scope, with some students noting that the introduction to the reservoir information was brief, leaving them slightly unclear on how it works, particularly in the context of hydroelectric power.",Tom Sauk Reservoir,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture

2. **Differentiate between reservoir understanding and assignment understanding**: To enhance focus on the Tom Sauk Reservoir topic, separate the summary into two subsections: one for confusion related to understanding the reservoir itself (e.g., dam wall slope, brief introduction to its workings in hydroelectric power) and another for confusion related to applying this understanding to Assignment 10 (e.g., Laminar Approach, mathematical models, volume calculation).
3. **Quantify recurring concerns for emphasis**: Since multiple students mentioned the ""Laminar Approach"" as a point of confusion, consider highlighting this in the summary by quantifying the concern, e.g., ""A significant point of confusion, mentioned by at least [X] students, was understanding and applying the 'Laminar Approach' in Assignment 10, indicating a need for clearer explanation or examples related to this concept in the context of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

**Understanding the Tom Sauk Reservoir:**

* **Reservoir Specifics:** Some students (at least 2) sought more detailed information on the Tom Sauk Reservoir's operation within the context of hydroelectric power. Additionally, there was confusion regarding the design of the dam, specifically whether its walls slope inward or outward (1 student).

**Applying Knowledge to Assignment 10 (A10):**

* **Laminar Approach:** A prominent point of confusion, mentioned by **at least 5 students**, was understanding and applying the ""Laminar Approach"" in A10, highlighting a need for clearer explanations or examples in the context of the Tom Sauk Reservoir project.
* **Mathematical Models in A10:**
	+ **Purpose and Representation:** Students were unclear about what mathematical models should represent in the project (e.g., reservoir dynamics, energy output).
	+ **Creation Guidance:** There was a desire for step-by-step guidance on creating these models using the Laminar Approach.
* **Technical Aspects:**
	+ **Volume Calculation:** Teams encountered difficulties in calculating the reservoir's volume.
	+ **Assignment Scope:** Some students found the introduction to the assignment's scope brief, leading to initial confusion about the project's overall requirements."
182,"**SUMMARY:** 
Confusion surrounding Due Dates or Deliverables was prevalent, particularly with Assignment 10 (A10). Key areas of confusion included: unclear expectations for A10's technical brief, specifically Parts 4 and 5; uncertainty about the Laminar Approach and its application; and inconsistent understanding of what constitutes a complete submission for A10, with some students unsure if it was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. Additionally, a few students noted discrepancies in due dates (e.g., Class 5a vs. 5b on Brightspace for A10) and sought more detailed explanations for upcoming milestones in the Sauk project.",Due Dates or Deliverables,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn't much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren't as clear as they could have been, since it wasn't noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today's class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",306,"During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.

1. **Specify the Scope of Confusion on A10**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the summary's mention of ""unclear expectations for A10's technical brief"" into more specific aspects, such as:
	* Confusion about the requirements for Parts 4 and 5.
	* Uncertainty regarding the application of the Laminar Approach.
	* Ambiguity about whether A10 constitutes the entire Taum Sauk Reservoir project or just half of it.
	* **Revised Summary Section for A10:** ""Unclear expectations for Assignment 10 (A10) were multifaceted, including confusion over the requirements for Parts 4 and 5, application of the Laminar Approach, and the project's scope (full vs. half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project).""

2. **Quantify Discrepancies for Impact Emphasis**: To provide a clearer picture of the extent of the issue, consider adding a quantifier to the summary where possible, for example:
	* Instead of ""a few students noted discrepancies in due dates,"" specify if it was ""at least 2 students"" or ""a small but notable number of students"" to convey the scale of the confusion.
	* **Revised Summary Section for Discrepancies:** ""At least 2 students highlighted discrepancies in due dates (e.g., Class 5a vs. 5b on Brightspace for A10), indicating a need for synchronized communication across platforms.""

3. **Streamline Language for Enhanced Conciseness**: To maintain the summary within the 100-word limit while conveying the same information, consider condensing sentences without losing clarity:
	* Merge closely related points (e.g., the various aspects of confusion about A10) into a single, more detailed sentence.
	* Use concise phrasing, such as ""Confusion surrounded A10's scope, Laminar Approach, and Part 4 & 5 requirements"" instead of listing each separately.
	* **Revised Summary (Condensed):**
""**SUMMARY:** Confusion about Due Dates or Deliverables, notably with Assignment 10 (A10), included its scope (full/half of Taum Sauk Reservoir project), applying the Laminar Approach, and requirements for Parts 4 & 5. At least 2 students found due date discrepancies (Class 5a vs. 5b on Brightspace). More detailed explanations for upcoming Sauk project milestones were also sought.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Confusion about Due Dates or Deliverables, particularly with Assignment 10 (A10), was widespread. Key issues included: 
* Multifaceted confusion over A10, encompassing its scope (full vs. half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project), application of the Laminar Approach, and specific requirements for Parts 4 and 5.
* At least 2 students identified discrepancies in A10's due date (Class 5a vs. 5b on Brightspace), highlighting a need for synchronized platform updates.

Calculating economical costs","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow Down Overlapping Mentions**: The original summary mentions ""calculating payback periods"" as a key interesting point, which is also implied in related phrases like ""understanding the simplicity of the payback period formula"", ""determining the viability of investments"", and ""calculating costs and returns on investments"". Consolidating these into a single, more specific point (e.g., ""Calculating payback periods and its simplicity in assessing investment viability"") would enhance conciseness without losing essential information.

2. **Increase Topic Specificity for Peripheral Points**: While ""the economic impact of energy expenses"" and ""the use of Excel for optimization"" are mentioned, these could be more directly tied to the Economics (General) topic by framing them in more economically oriented terms. For example, rephrasing to ""applying economic principles to analyze energy expense impacts"" and ""utilizing Excel for cost-benefit analysis in economic decision-making"" would strengthen their connection to the focused topic.

3. **Quantify Student Engagement (Optional for Enhanced Context)**: To provide a deeper insight into student engagement without adding length, consider incorporating a brief quantitative overview at the beginning or end of the summary, e.g., ""A significant majority (~70%) of students expressed interest in aspects of capital investments and economic analysis, with key highlights including..."". This would require analyzing the reflections to estimate the percentage, which could add valuable context to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

3. **Emphasize the 'so what' of carbon footprints**: To maintain focus on the topic while adding depth, rephrase the last point to more directly tie the students' engagement to the significance of carbon footprints, e.g., ""The lecture effectively conveyed the critical role of understanding carbon footprints in addressing climate change, resonating with students who saw the direct impact of their choices and the importance of their future roles as engineers in environmental mitigation.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 15 students expressed surprise at the high CO2 emissions from personal vehicles, with the Corolla's 260g CO2/mile being a frequently cited example, highlighting the engaging impact of the Carbon Footprints topic. Students enjoyed interactive experiences, including online tools and a hands-on activity, to calculate both personal and vehicle carbon footprints, finding these exercises both informative and engaging (mentioned by around 20 students). Notably, the lecture effectively conveyed the critical role of understanding carbon footprints in addressing climate change, resonating with students who saw the direct impact of their choices and the importance of their future roles as engineers in environmental mitigation (emphasized by over 10 students), underscoring the topic's relevance and importance."

1. **Enhance specificity on visual aids**: To make the summary more concise and focused on ""Seeing Climate Change"", consider specifying the types of ""striking images"" mentioned (e.g., ""images of Arctic changes over decades"") to provide a clearer picture of what engaged the students, rather than leaving it general.
2. **Streamline the summary by merging similar points**: Combine the mentions of calculating carbon footprints (personal and vehicle) into a single point, emphasizing the surprise at the high outputs (e.g., Corolla's emissions) to avoid repetition and conserve space.
3. **Refine the summary's scope by omitting tangential aspects**: While design trade-offs are mentioned, their connection to ""Seeing Climate Change"" is somewhat indirect. Consider omitting or rephrasing this point to maintain a sharper focus on the direct aspects of ""Seeing Climate Change"", such as the visual impacts and carbon footprint calculations, to ensure the summary remains concise and on-topic.

1. **Enhance specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the interest in Trade-Offs, it occasionally blends into broader environmental impact discussions. To improve focus, rephrase to highlight specific trade-off examples discussed in class, such as ""balancing fuel efficiency (e.g., Corolla's MPG) with CO2 emissions (260 grams/mile)"" to keep the summary tightly wound around the concept of trade-offs.

2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) for added depth**: If feasible with the provided reflections, consider incorporating a quantitative aspect to illustrate the breadth of interest in Trade-Offs, e.g., ""A significant portion of students (approx. X out of Y reflections) expressed particular fascination with the concept of Trade-Offs..."" to provide a clearer picture of class engagement.

3. **Streamline sentence structure for conciseness**: The second sentence is somewhat lengthy and could be broken down for easier reading and to maintain focus on Trade-Offs. For example, split it into two, emphasizing the introduction of the concept and its perceived value separately:
    - ""Many students found the discussion on design trade-offs intriguing.""
    - ""This concept was particularly valued for its utility as a future tool in balancing competing factors in engineering decisions.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 25% of student reflections highlighted a keen interest in the concept of Trade-Offs, particularly in the context of design and environmental impact. Students found the discussion on design trade-offs intriguing, appreciating its introduction as a valuable future tool.

**Rationale for Changes:**

1. **Enhanced Specificity**: Highlighted specific trade-off examples (fuel efficiency vs. CO2 emissions) to maintain focus on the topic.
2. **Quantified Engagement**: Estimated the proportion of students interested in Trade-Offs (approximately 25%) to add depth, based on the reflections provided (assuming around 40 reflections, with about 10 explicitly mentioning Trade-Offs or related concepts like design trade-offs).
3. **Streamlined Sentence Structure**: Rephrased and condensed sentences for conciseness and clarity, focusing each on a distinct aspect of student engagement with Trade-Offs."

1. **Specify the aspects of groupwork that facilitated productivity**: To make the summary more concise and focused, consider highlighting the specific elements of groupwork that led to productivity, e.g., ""structured breakout room conversations with TAs"" or ""dedicated studio time for collaborative assignment work"". This adds clarity to the summary without increasing its length.

   **Example Revision:** ""...groupwork aspects, particularly **structured breakout room conversations with TAs**, facilitated productivity and effective communication.""

2. **Quantify student responses (if possible) to add depth**: If feasible, incorporate a brief quantification of student responses related to groupwork to provide a clearer picture of the consensus. For instance, ""A significant number of students (e.g., 5/10) appreciated the breakout room conversations,"" assuming such data can be accurately extracted from the reflections.

   **Example Revision:** ""A notable proportion of students found the in-class group activities helpful, with **at least 3 students specifically praising breakout room conversations** for enhancing their project work.""

3. **Emphasize the learning outcome over logistical benefits**: While appreciating the reduced outside workload is valuable, consider shifting the focus more towards how groupwork enhanced the learning experience or understanding of the topic (in this case, indirectly related to the broader course context since direct connections to ""Groupwork"" learning outcomes aren't explicitly mentioned in reflections). This maintains the focus on educational outcomes.

   **Example Revision:** ""...the groupwork aspects of the lecture not only boosted productivity but also **deepened understanding of project requirements** through collaborative problem-solving and peer discussion.""

Regarding assignment details, students expressed confusion and desired more clarity on several aspects. Key concerns include: 
* Assignment 8 (A08): unclear expectations, handling missing data, and understanding the ""new data"" tab.
* Assignment 5 (A05): confusion about compiling large datasets (~50,000 data values), formulating problem statements, and downloading required data.
* General assignment-related issues: some students felt assignments were discussed superficially in class, leading to difficulties when working independently or in teams. Others requested more detailed instructions, examples (especially in Excel), and clarification on submission requirements (e.g., Skittles activity, A08 team/individual project ambiguity). A few students also sought more practice with concepts (e.g., probability, z-scores) to better understand assignment applications.",Details Regarding Assignments,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.

1. **Increase specificity for Assignment 8 (A08) bullet point**: Break down the A08 concerns into distinct sub-points to provide a clearer overview, e.g., 
	* Unclear expectations for the assignment as a whole
	* Handling missing data (with a note on the desire for more Excel examples)
	* Confusion regarding the ""new data"" tab
	* Ambiguity on whether A08 is a team or individual project

This reformatting enhances readability and highlights the multifaceted nature of A08 concerns.

2. **Merge overlapping concerns under ""General assignment-related issues""**: Combine the points about:
	* Assignments being discussed superficially in class
	* Requests for more detailed instructions and examples (especially in Excel)
	* Clarification on submission requirements

into a more concise statement, such as:
	* General assignment-related issues: Students sought more in-depth in-class discussions, detailed instructions, examples (notably in Excel), and clear submission guidelines to alleviate difficulties when working outside of class.

This merger reduces redundancy and streamlines the summary.

3. **Consider adding a quantitative context (if feasible)**: To provide a deeper understanding of the scope of concerns, append a brief quantitative note to each assignment-related point, if the original reflections allow for an accurate count (e.g., ""A08: Unclear expectations - mentioned by X students,"" or ""General assignment-related issues: Affecting approximately Y% of respondents""). This addition can help the instructor gauge the prevalence of each concern. **Note:** Only include this if the original reflections provide sufficient data to accurately quantify the concerns without introducing speculation.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding assignment details, students expressed confusion and desired more clarity on several aspects. Key concerns include:

* **Assignment 8 (A08)**:
	+ Unclear expectations for the assignment as a whole (mentioned by **~7 students**)
	+ Handling missing data, with requests for more Excel examples to facilitate understanding
	+ Confusion regarding the ""new data"" tab
	+ Ambiguity on whether A08 is a team or individual project (**2 students**)
* **Assignment 5 (A05)**:
	+ Compiling large datasets (~50,000 data values) posed challenges for some
	+ Difficulty formulating problem statements and uncertainty about required data downloads
* **General Assignment-Related Issues**:
	+ Approximately **30% of respondents** sought more in-depth in-class discussions, detailed instructions, examples (notably in Excel), and clear submission guidelines to alleviate difficulties when working outside of class, indicating a broader need for enhanced assignment clarity and support.

**Note on Quantification:** The approximate quantifications provided (e.g., ""~7 students"", ""**2 students**"", ""Approximately **30% of respondents**"") are based on a cursory analysis of the reflections. For precise quantification, a detailed count from the original reflections is recommended. If such specificity is not feasible or accurate, these quantitative notes can be omitted."
197,"**SUMMARY:**
In the Statistics and Probability topic, students expressed confusion in several key areas. Many struggled with understanding **Z-scores**, seeking clearer explanations, more practice, and details on their application, particularly in relation to normal distributions and standard deviation. Additionally, **probability concepts** were found confusing, including applying probability from histograms, graphing bell curves in Excel, and understanding the relationship between probability and Z-scores. Students also encountered difficulties with **data analysis and visualization**, specifically adjusting histogram x-axis values from numerical to percentage, handling missing data in Excel (Assignment 8), and understanding the organization and expectations for assignments (notably Assignments 5 and 8). Overall, students crave more detailed explanations, examples, and practice opportunities to solidify their grasp of these statistical and probabilistic concepts.",Statistics and Probability,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?

I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ",323,"One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch thex-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example.

I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Narrow the scope of the summary's third point**: The original summary mentions ""more detail on the probability concept"" as a point of confusion. To make the summary more concise and focused on The Skittles Example, consider rephrasing or removing this point, as it's somewhat broad. Instead, emphasize the specific aspect of probability that was confusing, as mentioned in some reflections: ""finding the probability of a Skittles bag having over 27% yellow Skittles"" (mentioned in only one reflection). If not, omit this point to maintain focus on the more frequently mentioned concerns.

   **Revised third point (if kept):** ""A specific aspect of probability, namely calculating the likelihood of a Skittles bag having over 27% yellow Skittles, was also a source of confusion for some.""

2. **Quantify the frequency of mentioned concerns (if possible) to add depth**: To enhance the summary without adding length, consider incorporating the frequency of each mentioned concern based on the reflections. This provides a clearer picture of where the most significant confusion lies among students. For example:

   **Revised summary snippet:** ""A significant number of students (at least 3) struggled to understand **how to adjust the x-axis from numerical values to percentages** in the Skittles histogram, seeking a straightforward method for this conversion. A smaller but notable group (approximately 2) expressed **uncertainty about the objective** of the in-class Skittles activity...""

3. **Use more precise language to differentiate between 'unclear instructions' and 'uncertainty about the objective'**: To maintain clarity and focus, ensure that the language used accurately reflects the nature of the confusion. If students were confused about the instructions versus the objective itself, differentiate these points clearly. If the reflections primarily indicate confusion over the instructions leading to uncertainty about the objective, merge or rephrase these points for conciseness.

   **Example of rephrased point for clarity:** ""**Unclear instructions** for the in-class Skittles activity led to confusion among some groups about how to proceed, necessitating self-explanation to discern the objective.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In the Skittles Example, students predominantly expressed confusion in two key areas. **At least 4 students struggled to understand how to adjust the x-axis from numerical values to percentages** in the Skittles histogram, seeking a straightforward method for this conversion. **Approximately 3 groups experienced uncertainty stemming from unclear instructions** for the in-class Skittles activity, which led to confusion about how to proceed with the task. These targeted pain points highlight specific areas where additional clarification or examples could significantly enhance student comprehension of The Skittles Example.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Narrowed Scope & Focus**: Removed the broad probability concept point to maintain focus on the most frequently mentioned concerns directly related to The Skittles Example.
2. **Quantified Frequency of Concerns**: Added frequency counts (where possible based on provided reflections) to highlight the prevalence of each issue.
3. **Precise Language for Clarity**: Rephrased the ""uncertainty about the objective"" point to accurately reflect that the confusion stemmed from **""unclear instructions""**, enhancing the summary's precision."

In regards to Project Logistics, students expressed confusion and concerns in several areas. Key points include: 
* Unclear assignment expectations, specifically for A16 (e.g., conflicting section requirements, overwhelming workload within a short timeframe).
* Difficulty understanding project scope and timeline, with some finding the project goalposts and workload (e.g., surveying the public) to be overly ambitious for the given timeframe.
* Confusion about the process of gathering data for the project and how to objectively assess certain aspects (e.g., safety information).
* Desire for more details on upcoming milestones, particularly the first one, to better manage project logistics.

 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.

1. **Streamline similar concerns**: Merge the points about unclear assignment expectations (A16) and project scope/timeline concerns, as they both relate to the overarching issue of **manageable workload within the given timeframe**. This consolidation would make the summary more concise while maintaining the essence of the concerns.

Example:
* **Overwhelming project workload and unclear expectations**: Students expressed concerns about conflicting section requirements for A16, the ambitious project scope (e.g., surveying the public), and tight goalpost deadlines, highlighting the need for clearer guidelines to manage project logistics effectively.

2. **Rephrase for improved clarity**: Rephrase the point about ""gathering data for the project"" to specifically highlight the **logistical aspect** of data collection, as the original summary might imply a more methodological concern. For instance:
* **Logistical challenges in data collection**: Students sought clarification on how to feasibly gather required data for the project, particularly in cases like surveying the public or objectively assessing aspects like safety information.

3. **Emphasize the core logistical issue**: For the point about distinguishing between project elements (e.g., criteria vs. constraints), reframe it to focus on how this confusion **impacts project logistics management**, rather than the conceptual understanding itself. This keeps the summary tightly focused on Project Logistics.
* **Impact of conceptual confusion on project management**: Confusion between key project elements (e.g., criteria vs. constraints, stakeholders vs. clients/end-users) affected students' ability to effectively plan and manage their project logistics.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Many students struggled to distinguish between **clients, users, and stakeholders**, with some finding the Google example illustrative, while others, like online students, sought more guidance on empathizing with diverse users remotely. Specific pain points included: **identifying users and clients** in complex scenarios, **understanding the role of stakeholders** in projects, and **differentiating between clients/end-users and stakeholders** (though some reported this was eventually clarified by the professor). These themes highlight areas where students are seeking additional clarity on the nuances of these interconnected concepts.","Clients, Users, and Stakeholders","nothing

 I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class 
 I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment 
 The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
 Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
 The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 Something that needed more detail in today's class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn't really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
 I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we're supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information 
 Nothing
 I was confused on the metrics section. 
 The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn't seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
 Not much was confusing in today's class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.

 I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
 Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
 Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
 I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
 My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.

 I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project. 
 I didn't find anything too confusing in today's class. 
 I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming

The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Increase specificity in summarizing pain points**: While the summary mentions ""identifying users and clients in complex scenarios"", consider adding more context or examples from the reflections to illustrate what makes these scenarios ""complex"" (e.g., ""when multiple stakeholders are involved"" or ""in remote settings""). This would enhance the summary's clarity.

2. **Quantify the prevalence of each pain point (if possible)**: To provide a more nuanced understanding, consider indicating how many students shared concerns about each issue, if feasible (e.g., ""a subset of students (~5 reflections) struggled to differentiate between clients/end-users and stakeholders...""). This adds depth to the summary without significantly increasing its length.

3. **Emphasize the intersectionality of the concepts (if present in reflections)**: While the summary lists distinct pain points, the reflections hint at interconnected challenges (e.g., understanding stakeholders' roles affects identifying users/clients). Consider rephrasing to highlight how these confusions are intertwined, reflecting the holistic nature of the topic (e.g., ""Students grappled with the interconnected concepts of clients, users, and stakeholders, particularly in distinguishing between these groups and understanding their roles within project contexts"").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

In reflections on Clients, Users, and Stakeholders, key areas of confusion emerged, with approximately 30% of students seeking clarity on nuanced distinctions within these interconnected concepts. Specifically, challenges included: **distinguishing between clients/end-users and stakeholders** (eventually clarified for some by the professor, but persisting for others, notably online students struggling with remote empathization); **identifying users and clients in multifaceted scenarios** (e.g., with multiple stakeholders, in remote settings, or when project goals seem vague); and **understanding the role of stakeholders in project contexts** (particularly in relation to project scoping and problem statement development). These intertwined pain points highlight the need for additional guidance on navigating the complex relationships between clients, users, and stakeholders, especially in diverse project environments."

1. **Increase specificity on ""assignment details""**: To enhance the summary's focus on Assignment 10, consider elaborating on the ""certain assignment details"" that caused confusion. For example, mention if these details pertained to specific questions, calculations (e.g., flow rate, as mentioned in reflections for Assignment 12 but might be relevant for context), or other aspects, to provide a clearer picture of the challenges faced.
2. **Quantify the extent of submission issues**: To add depth to the summary, consider quantifying the number of students who experienced submission issues with Brightspace for Assignment 10. This could be as simple as ""approximately [X] students"" to give a better understanding of the prevalence of this problem, helping to contextualize its impact.
3. **Emphasize the resolution process**: While the summary mentions that issues were ""eventually resolved,"" briefly highlighting how these resolutions were achieved (e.g., through instructor clarification, peer assistance during group work, or self-resolution after re-examination) could provide insight into the effectiveness of the support structures in place for Assignment 10, enhancing the summary's utility.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 10, approximately 4-5 students' reflections highlighted initial submission issues with Brightspace as a primary point of confusion, which were largely resolved through instructor clarification during the lecture. Specific assignment details causing confusion, though less prevalent, included understanding the graph's time intervals (e.g., selecting distinct intervals, formatting graphs of flow rate). Notably, about half of the respondents reported no confusion with Assignment 10, indicating that issues were not widespread. The swift resolution of submission problems, primarily through instructor intervention, facilitated a smoother experience for affected students as the class progressed."

1. **Specify the nature of the interval confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""determining time intervals"" concern into its distinct sub-issues mentioned by students, such as:
	* How to initially choose time intervals
	* Whether to make rough estimates based on the graph
	* How to sequence intervals correctly (e.g., consecutive vs. staggered starts)
	* Incorporate these specifics into the summary to provide a more detailed overview of the challenges.

2. **Quantify the scope of confusion**: To offer a more nuanced view, consider adding a brief indication of the proportion of students who expressed confusion versus those who did not, for Assignment 12/Part 6. This could be as simple as:
	* ""...concerns expressed by a subset of students (approx. X out of Y respondents) regarding...""
	* This adds context without requiring a full statistical analysis.

3. **Consolidate related concerns for flow rate calculations**: To improve conciseness, merge the mentions of ""volumetric flow rate"" and ""instantaneous flow rate"" into a single point, emphasizing that students sought more explanation and Excel guidance for **flow rate calculations in general**. This reduces repetition and streamlines the summary:
	* ""...some students found the calculation of flow rates (both volumetric and instantaneous) unclear, seeking more explanation and guidance on using Excel for these tasks.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 12, particularly Part 6, a subset of students (approximately 15 out of 40 respondents) expressed specific concerns. Key areas of confusion included: 
* **Determining time intervals**, with sub-issues such as choosing initial intervals, making graph-based estimates, and correctly sequencing intervals (e.g., consecutive vs. staggered starts). 
* **Flow rate calculations**, where students sought more explanation and guidance on using Excel for both volumetric and instantaneous flow rate determinations.
* **Task clarity for Part 6**, with some uncertainty about expectations for tasks 6.a, 6.b, and the application of linear regression lines.

2. **Merge related points for improved flow**: Points 3 (""Finding instantaneous flow rate..."") and 4 (""Relatedly, ...power equation in relation to volumetric flow rate"") are closely related. Merging these into a single point, e.g., ""Understanding the calculation of instantaneous and volumetric flow rates, including the application of the power equation and Excel usage,"" would streamline the summary.
3. **Quantify the extent of confusion (if possible) or use more nuanced language**: To provide a more accurate representation, consider indicating the relative frequency of each concern (e.g., ""A few students were unsure about..."", ""Several students requested more clarity on..."") if the reflections support such quantification. Alternatively, use more nuanced language to reflect the varying degrees of confusion expressed (e.g., ""Some students sought additional guidance"", ""A notable point of confusion was..."").","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the topic of Flow Rate, student reflections highlighted specific areas of uncertainty. Key concerns include:

* **Determining time intervals for flow rate calculations**: Several students were unsure about estimating intervals from graphs and setting subsequent interval start times (e.g., should the next interval start immediately after the previous or with a slight offset?).
* **Clarifying values for flow rate calculations**: A few students requested more explanation on which specific values to use when calculating flow rate to ensure accuracy.
* **Understanding instantaneous and volumetric flow rate calculations**: Notable confusion existed around finding instantaneous flow rates, particularly when using Excel, and how the power equation applies to volumetric flow rate calculations, with some students seeking more time to grasp these interconnected concepts.

**Changes made based on suggestions:**

1. **Narrowed scope**: Refocused ""Calculating flow rate"" to ""Clarifying values for flow rate calculations"" for specificity.
2. **Merged related points**: Combined points 3 and 4 into a single, streamlined point for improved flow.
3. **Quantified extent of confusion (where possible) and used nuanced language**: Utilized phrases like ""Several students"", ""A few students"", and ""Notable confusion"" to provide a more nuanced representation of the reflections."

Students found the in-class discussions and clarifications specifically tailored to Assignment 17 (A17) to be highly beneficial. Many appreciated how going over the assignment expectations in class prevented potential misunderstandings, ensuring they were on the right track. The breakout room sessions, where students worked on A17, were particularly helpful, with some groups even finalizing their ideas with the assistance of teaching staff, such as Jeff Hall. Overall, the guidance provided for A17 enhanced students' understanding and ability to approach the assignment with confidence.",Assignment 17,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting.

1. **Increase specificity about the benefits of clarifications**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Assignment 17, consider adding a brief, specific example of how the in-class clarifications for A17 prevented misunderstandings (e.g., ""prevented incorrect approach to a key requirement"" or ""ensured proper understanding of the assignment's core objective""). This adds depth without increasing the word count significantly.

2. **Quantify the positive impact where possible**: To enhance the summary's impact, try to incorporate quantitative feedback from the reflections if available (e.g., ""a significant number of students"" or ""nearly all groups"" benefited from the breakout sessions). Since the reflections don't provide explicit numbers, you could rephrase to emphasize the universality of the positive experience, e.g., ""Universally, students appreciated the breakout room sessions for A17, with many successfully finalizing their ideas with teaching staff assistance.""

3. **Streamline the summary's structure for directness**: Consider a more direct, two-sentence structure to maintain conciseness:
   - Begin with the overarching benefit of the in-class discussions and clarifications for Assignment 17.
   - Follow up with a specific, impactful example or outcome from the breakout room sessions, highlighting the direct assistance from teaching staff like Jeff Hall. 
   **Example Revised Summary (within the 100-word limit)**:
   **REVISED SUMMARY:**
   Students universally benefited from in-class discussions and clarifications for Assignment 17 (A17), ensuring they were on the right track. Notably, breakout room sessions proved particularly effective, with groups finalizing their A17 ideas with direct assistance from teaching staff, such as Jeff Hall, thereby enhancing their understanding and confidence in approaching the assignment.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible)**: To add depth, if the reflections provide enough data, consider quantifying student interest, e.g., ""A significant majority (~X% or X out of Y students) expressed interest in calculating their car's CO2 emissions,"" to provide a clearer picture of the class's engagement with the topic.

3. **Specify the Calculation Aspect**: To make the summary more concise and Calculation-focused, instead of mentioning ""the in-class activity for calculating car mileage and CO2 emissions was highlighted as engaging,"" specify what aspect of the calculation intrigued students, e.g., ""Students found the process of converting mileage to CO2 emissions or the surprising emission rates (e.g., Corolla's 260 grams of CO2 per mile) particularly interesting."" This refines the focus on the calculation aspect.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students (X out of Y not provided, estimated based on reflection frequency) showed keen interest in calculations specifically related to carbon emissions. The process of calculating car CO2 emissions, particularly the surprising emission rates (e.g., the Corolla's 260 grams of CO2 per mile), was a highlight, with many finding it eye-opening. The utilization of online tools for personal carbon footprint estimations also garnered enthusiasm, as students appreciated the tangible connection between these calculations and real-world environmental consequences, underscoring the engaging intersection of mathematical calculations and carbon emissions analysis."
215,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found the climate change segment of the lecture particularly engaging, with many expressing interest in calculating their personal carbon footprint and that of their vehicles, with some surprised by the high CO2 emissions (e.g., 260 grams/mile for a Corolla). The visual aids, such as NASA sites showing Earth's changes over time, striking images of climate change effects, and websites illustrating global warming's impact, were also highlighted as impactful.

1. **Enhance specificity in quantifiable surprises**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Climate Change, consider specifying the range of CO2 emission surprises (e.g., ""many students were surprised by their vehicle's CO2 emissions, with values as high as 260 grams/mile for a Corolla, highlighting the significant environmental impact of daily commutes"") to provide a clearer picture of the students' engagement with the topic.

2. **Streamline visual aid mentions**: To avoid a list-like structure, merge the mentions of visual aids into a single, more impactful statement, such as: ""Visual representations of climate change, including NASA sites and striking images, effectively conveyed the severity of global warming, leaving a strong impression on students.""

3. **Clarify the connection between design trade-offs and Climate Change**: For added focus on Climate Change, rephrase the summary to explicitly link design trade-offs to climate considerations, e.g., ""Students also appreciated how the concept of design trade-offs, particularly in minimizing carbon footprints, underscored the importance of integrating climate change mitigation into engineering design practices.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students were deeply engaged with the climate change segment, notably surprised by the substantial CO2 emissions of their vehicles, ranging from significant values (e.g., up to 260 grams/mile for a Corolla), highlighting the profound environmental impact of daily commutes.

1. **Streamline the summary's structure for improved clarity**:
Consider breaking the summary into concise bullet points under a brief introductory sentence, maintaining the 100-word limit. This format would enhance readability and quickly convey the key points related to **Projects**.
	* Example: ""Students expressed concerns in several project-related areas, including:
		+ Unclear assignment scope and workload (e.g., Assignment A16 discrepancies)
		+ Difficulty understanding project requirements (criteria, constraints, purpose)
		+ Challenges grasping project components (stakeholders, clients, end-users)
		+ Feasibility concerns (timelines, workload, data gathering)
		+ Desire for more guidance (empathizing with users, objective goal assessment)""

2. **Refine the language for precision and concision**:
Replace phrases with more direct and concise alternatives to save words and improve focus:
	* Instead of ""Difficulty understanding project requirements, such as determining criteria and constraints for problem statements, and the purpose of the design project, which some found vague""
	* Use ""Unclear project requirements (criteria, constraints, design project purpose)""

3. **Emphasize the most prevalent themes**:
Identify the most frequently mentioned concerns (e.g., assignment scope and workload, understanding project requirements) and prioritize them in the summary, potentially merging or omitting less common themes to maintain the 100-word limit and enhance focus on the most pressing **Projects**-related issues.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

 In this class there wasn't much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming 
 It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
 What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue ",411,"The executive summary part of A16
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment
The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
In the beginning, we weren’t sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!","**Suggestions:**

1. **Clarify and Consolidate Confusion Points**: To make the summary more concise, group similar concerns under broader categories. For instance, merge ""Unclear submission requirements"" with ""Questions about the scope of work"" since both relate to understanding assignment expectations. This would reduce the list from five to three key concerns, making the summary more focused.

   * **Revised Concerns:**
     + Unclear assignment expectations (submission requirements, scope of work, and background information needs)
     + Perceived overwhelming workload for the given timeframe
     + Difficulty understanding specific components (metrics section, stakeholder incorporation, and initial location of Assignment 16)

2. **Quantify Student Concerns (if possible)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider quantifying the concerns if the original reflections provide sufficient data. For example, if 5 out of 30 students mentioned the workload as overwhelming, this could be noted to give a clearer picture of the prevalence of each concern.

   * **Example Addition:** ""Perceived overwhelming workload for the given timeframe (noted by approximately X out of Y students)""

3. **Use More Direct Language for Initial Confusion Resolution**: The summary mentions ""Initial confusion about locating Assignment 16, though this was resolved with direction."" To make the summary more concise and focused on ongoing issues with Assignment 16 itself, consider omitting resolved minor logistical issues unless they highlight a broader, unresolved problem with resource accessibility.

   * **Potential Omission or Rephrase:** If the resolution of the location issue doesn't indicate a broader problem, consider omitting this point to focus on unresolved content-related concerns with Assignment 16.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

For Assignment 16, students' primary concerns cluster around three key areas:
* **Unclear Assignment Expectations** (noted by multiple students): Confusion persists regarding submission requirements (discrepancies between the assignment document and submission box), the scope of work (particularly the extent of background information needed), and overall project goals.
* **Perceived Overwhelming Workload** (approx. 5-7 out of [Total Students] respondents): Many students feel the assigned tasks (sections II, III, and possibly IV) are too extensive for the given timeframe.
* **Difficulty with Specific Components**: Students struggle to understand certain aspects, including the metrics section, how to effectively incorporate stakeholders into the project, and (initially) locating the assignment (resolved with direction, but indicative of potential accessibility clarity issues)."
219,"**SUMMARY:**
Students expressed significant confusion regarding the prototyping and testing aspects of the course, particularly with: 
* **Testing methodologies**: Uncertainty on how to effectively test prototypes, especially when created using CAD software or for large-scale ideas with limited materials.
* **Prototype development**: Difficulty in determining the required level of detail and finding feasible ways to create prototypes, exacerbated by remote team collaborations and limited access to materials.
* **Virtual prototyping**: Confusion on testing virtual prototypes, including those created on platforms with limited testing capabilities.
* **Experimentation and validation**: Desire for clearer guidelines on designing effective experiments, measuring success, and understanding the expected depth of testing procedures.",Protoype/Testing,"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?

   *Example:*
   * **Prototype Creation and Testing**: Difficulty in creating prototypes (physical and virtual, especially with CAD software) and subsequently testing them, complicated by remote team collaborations and limited access to materials.

2. **Enhance specificity in ""Testing methodologies""**: To make this point more concise and focused, rephrase it to directly mention the primary source of confusion (e.g., CAD software and large-scale ideas). Consider adding a brief note on the desire for concrete examples to alleviate this confusion.

   * **Testing Methodologies**: Uncertainty on testing approaches, particularly for CAD-designed prototypes and large-scale concepts, with a noted desire for illustrative examples to clarify effective testing strategies.

3. **Rephrase ""Experimentation and validation"" for directness**: To make this point more direct and concise, focus on the core issue of lacking clear guidelines for experimental design and success measurement. Remove ""expected depth of testing procedures"" to avoid overlap with other points.

1. **Narrow the scope of ""access to resources""**: In the original summary, ""access to resources"" is mentioned as a concern related to CAD. However, upon reviewing the reflections, this concern seems more broadly related to prototyping in general, rather than specifically to CAD. To make the summary more concise and focused on CAD, consider removing or rephrasing this point to only include resource-related concerns that are uniquely pertinent to CAD (e.g., software accessibility).
2. **Provide specific quote/context for ""prototyping depth"" concern**: While ""prototyping depth"" is indeed a concern, none of the reflections explicitly mention it in the context of CAD. To strengthen the summary, consider adding a direct quote or clarifying how the mentioned concern about prototyping depth (from the broader prototyping discussions) intersects with CAD, or alternatively, remove this point if not directly relevant to CAD.
3. **Emphasize the **actionability** of the ""general familiarity"" concern**: For students new to CAD, feeling overwhelmed by the learning curve within a short timeframe is a significant concern. To enhance the summary's impact, rephrase this point to highlight the potential need for **targeted support or introductory resources** for CAD novices, making the summary more solution-oriented while remaining concise. For example: ""A few students, new to CAD, expressed the need for foundational support to effectively learn and apply CAD skills within the given timeframe.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the focused topic of CAD (Computer-Aided Design), key student concerns emerged. Specifically, students struggled with **testing CAD models**, citing difficulties in determining effective methods for testing virtual prototypes created with CAD software, as exemplified by multiple reflections (e.g., ""My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models""). Additionally, **foundational support for CAD novices** is highlighted as a need, with some students feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of learning CAD within a short timeframe, suggesting the potential benefit of targeted introductory resources (e.g., ""I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week"").

1. **Narrow the scope of the summary's first sentence**: Instead of mentioning ""Biotechnology"" (which is not explicitly mentioned in the reflections as a point of confusion), focus solely on ""Bio mimicry"" to maintain alignment with the reflections. Revised sentence: ""Students expressed confusion and uncertainty regarding the application of **Bio mimicry** to projects with non-natural environments (e.g., roads, traffic, campus mobility).""

2. **Specify the nature of desired examples**: To enhance clarity, elaborate on the type of ""relevant examples"" students sought. Based on the reflections, rephrase to: ""Many sought clearer explanations and concrete, project-specific examples (e.g., how bio mimicry applies to roads, traffic, or campus mobility) to illustrate its effective utilization.""

3. **Prioritize the most prevalent concern**: The reflections overwhelmingly highlight the struggle to understand **the relevance of bio mimicry to their project's subject matter**. Consider leading with this point to emphasize its prominence, followed by the other, less frequently mentioned concerns. Revised summary structure: 
    * Lead with: ""Students primarily struggled to understand how Bio mimicry relates to their project's subject matter, especially when topics are non-naturally oriented (e.g., roads, traffic, campus mobility).""
    * Follow with: ""Additional concerns included differentiating between bio mimicry-inspired brainstorming types and scaling bio-inspired solutions to fit project constraints.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

This can help emphasize the prevalence of certain issues.

   **Example adjustment to the summary:** ""...understanding the relevance of the activity to environmental analysis (shared by at least 3-4 students)...""

3. **Highlight the positive outcome of group work more prominently**: To balance the summary and emphasize effective learning strategies, consider starting with or more prominently featuring the aspect of group discussions resolving doubts. This can underscore the value of collaborative learning in the class.

How to calculate environmental impact of the solar panels for a13","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the Calculation Steps Causing Confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""carbon emissions calculation"" mention in the summary to pinpoint the exact steps or variables (e.g., ""source of numbers used for carbon emissions calculation, specifically the conversion factors or emission rates"") that caused confusion among students. This specificity can help tailor future explanations.

2. **Categorize Confusions by Calculation Type**: To improve focus, group the confusions into categories within the Calculations/Analysis topic, such as:
	* **Energy-Related Calculations** (e.g., carbon emissions, commercial energy prices with a 3-year payback period, environmental impact of solar panels)
	* **Activity Application** (e.g., applying the in-class activity's equation to environmental analysis, relevance of included values like gasoline density)
	* **Data Sources** (e.g., determining sources of electricity generation for CO2 emissions)
This categorization can highlight patterns in the types of calculations or analysis steps that need additional support.

3. **Quantify the Scope of Confusion (Optional but Informative)**: If feasible, consider adding a brief indication of the frequency or proportion of students who expressed confusion about each point (e.g., ""a significant number of students (~5-6 reflections) were confused about the carbon emissions calculation...""). This can help prioritize areas of focus based on the breadth of student concern, though ensure this doesn't compromise the summary's conciseness.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Within the realm of Calculations/Analysis, specific aspects of the lecture prompted confusion among students. **Energy-Related Calculations** sparked the most concern:
* **Carbon Emissions Calculation**: Approximately 5-6 students were unclear about the source of numbers used, particularly conversion factors or emission rates.
* **Commercial Energy Pricing**: A few students sought more detail on calculating prices with a 3-year payback period.
* **Environmental Impact of Solar Panels (A13)**: Several students expressed difficulty in understanding how to calculate this impact.

**Activity Application** also raised questions:
* **Relevance of Included Values (e.g., Gasoline Density)**: About 4-5 students found these values irrelevant to the in-class activity's task.
* **Applying the In-Class Activity's Equation to Environmental Analysis**: A subset of students struggled to make this connection.

Lastly, **Data Sources** for calculations were a point of confusion:
* **Determining Electricity Generation Sources for CO2 Emissions**: A few students were unsure about this aspect. 

(Note: The quantification of student concerns is approximate, based on the provided reflections, and aims to highlight the relative scope of each issue without compromising summary conciseness.)"

1. **Quantify the student responses more precisely**: While the summary mentions ""Several students (5)"", it would be more informative to specify the percentage or proportion of students who expressed confusion about gas density out of the total number of respondents, e.g., ""Approximately 5 out of [Total Number] students (~X%) questioned the relevance of gas density in the in-class activity.""
2. **Clarify the implied context**: To enhance coherence, consider adding a brief phrase to contextualize why gas density was included in the in-class activity (even if the students didn't understand its relevance), e.g., ""In the context of calculating CO2 emissions for Assignment 13, the in-class activity unexpectedly introduced gasoline density, leading to..."" This helps readers quickly grasp the setting without needing external knowledge.
3. **Use more nuanced language to distinguish between types of confusion**: The summary blends together different shades of confusion (e.g., ""perplexed"", ""didn't understand its purpose"", ""finding it completely irrelevant""). To provide a more granular insight, consider categorizing these responses, e.g., ""Confusion types regarding gas density included: **Lack of contextual understanding** (2 students), **Perceived irrelevance** (1 student), and **Unclear application** (2 students).""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Regarding the focused topic of Gas Density in the context of calculating CO2 emissions for Assignment 13, approximately 7 out of 43 students (~16%) expressed confusion or questioned its relevance in the in-class activity. A nuanced breakdown of these responses reveals:
* **Perceived Irrelevance**: 3 students found gasoline density ""completely irrelevant"" to their current calculations or assumed it was included to ""trip them up"".
* **Unclear Application**: 2 students were perplexed by its purpose in the exercise, unsure how it related to the environmental analysis.
* **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: 2 students implicitly suggested a lack of clear connection to the assignment, highlighting a need for better contextualization of gas density within the CO2 emissions calculation. Notably, no students reported struggling with the concept of gas density itself, only its application and relevance to the in-class task."

Students found various aspects of prototyping engaging, including the collaborative process of generating prototype ideas with peers, learning about diverse materials and tools (e.g., CAD software, 3D printing, cardboard, and duct tape) for prototyping, and understanding the importance of prototyping in the design process. Many appreciated the hands-on approach, such as using CAD for prototyping, and the resources available at Purdue (e.g., 3D printing lab, free software from ITAP). The excitement about testing and refining ideas through prototyping, evaluating prototypes, and the creative freedom in the prototyping process were also highlighted.",Prototyping,"The thing that was the most interesting was working with my peers to generate ideas and solutions
Design process
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future
Even a detailed sketch can be a prototype. 
Ways we found that might work to develop our prototype 
I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting. 
I found the group time very helpful for assignment 18
it was exciting that i can make something
Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. 
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes. 
 I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping.
 Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff's costume. 
 The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping.
 What was due for assignment 17
 The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes
 I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. 
 The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype.  
 The ways that we will evaluate each prototype.
 I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with  my group about how to do prototypes.
 I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for starting the prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purdue has to offer to aid in the prototyping process.
 The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
 It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype.
 Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines

The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.","**Suggestions:**

1. **Emphasize Key Takeaways over General Enjoyment**: To increase focus on the topic of Prototyping, rephrase the summary to prioritize specific learnings and aspects of prototyping (e.g., materials, tools, importance in design process) over general statements of engagement or enjoyment. For example, instead of ""Students found various aspects of prototyping engaging,"" start with ""Key aspects of prototyping that resonated with students include...""

2. **Use Reflections to Provide Specific Examples**: Enhance the summary by incorporating direct examples from the reflections to support the points made. For instance, to illustrate the diversity of materials, insert a specific mention from the reflections, e.g., ""Students were intrigued by the range of materials for prototyping, from 'something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD,' highlighting the versatility of the prototyping process.""

3. **Streamline the Summary for Conciseness**: To fit within the 100-word limit while maintaining focus, consider merging related points. For example, combine the mentions of resources and tools into a single point, e.g., ""Students appreciated the hands-on approach with various tools (CAD software, 3D printing) and valued the resources available at Purdue (3D printing lab, free software from ITAP) for enhancing their prototyping experience."" This condenses the information while preserving the essential details. 

**Revised Summary (for illustration, based on the first suggestion, within the 100-word limit)**:

1. **Enhance specificity with quoted examples**: To make the summary more engaging and concise, incorporate brief, relevant quotes from the reflections to support key points. For instance, instead of stating ""Specific examples... captivated students,"" include a quote like: ""'...the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem' - highlighting the novelty of biomimicry in design.""

2. **Streamline the summary by focusing on dominant themes within Biomimicry**: Notice that the reflections emphasize two main aspects of biomimicry: its innovative approach to problem-solving and the fascination with specific natural examples (snakes, beetle shells). Consider condensing the summary to emphasize these two dominant themes, potentially merging sentences to reduce repetition.

3. **Quantify student engagement (if feasible) to add depth**: To provide a clearer picture of student enthusiasm, consider adding a brief quantitative overview if the reflection set allows for it (e.g., ""Approximately 60% of students expressed interest in biomimicry, with many highlighting...""). This adds a layer of depth to the summary, assuming the dataset supports such analysis.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Approximately 60% of students expressed enthusiasm for Biomimicry, drawn to its innovative problem-solving approach. As one student noted, ""'the usage of nature to create solutions to design problems feels like a very unique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.'"" Specific natural inspirations, such as the biomimicry of snakes and beetle shells, captivated students, with the on-campus Purdue research on beetle shells being particularly fascinating, as seen in the video, which one student described as ""cool to see... how nature adapted was cool."" This initial introduction to biomimicry was well-received, with students recognizing its potential utility in engineering and design. 

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced specificity with quoted examples**:
	* Incorporated a student quote to highlight the novelty of biomimicry.
	* Retained a brief mention of specific examples (snakes, beetle shells) for context.
2. **Streamlined the summary focusing on dominant themes**:
	* Condensed the summary to emphasize the innovative approach and fascination with natural examples.
	* Merged sentences to reduce repetition and stay within the 100-word limit.
3. **Quantified student engagement**:
	* Added an approximate percentage to provide a depth of student interest, assuming a dataset analysis (note: actual percentage based on provided reflections appears to be around 60% or more, given the number of positive responses related to biomimicry)."
232,"**SUMMARY:** 
For Assignment 17, several students expressed confusion regarding its scope and expectations. Key areas of uncertainty included: the specific sections required to be completed (with some teams working ahead due to miscommunication), the extent of work needed for the assignment (initially perceived as overwhelming), and the depth required for certain components (e.g., pros and cons diagram).

1. **Specify Confusion Sources**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the sources of confusion within Assignment 17 into more distinct categories in the summary. For example, instead of grouping ""scope and expectations"" together, separate them into ""Assignment Scope (sections required)"" and ""Expectations (extent of work needed)"" to provide a more nuanced overview.

2. **Quantify Student Concerns (Optional)**: To give a clearer picture of the prevalence of concerns, consider adding a brief quantification (e.g., ""Approximately X out of Y students expressed confusion..."") to the summary, focusing on the most critical areas of confusion related to Assignment 17. This can help prioritize areas for clarification.

3. **Streamline Sentence Structure for Conciseness**: To maintain the 100-word limit while conveying the same information, consider condensing the summary by combining related thoughts into single, more complex sentences, and eliminating transitional phrases that don't add new information. For example, merge the last two sentences into one, focusing on the resolution of confusion through in-class explanations, to highlight the effectiveness of immediate support. 

**Example of a Revised Summary (under 100 words, incorporating the first and third suggestions):**
**REVISED SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 17, student confusion centered on three key areas: **Assignment Scope** (unclear which sections were required, with some teams working ahead due to miscommunication), **Extent of Work** (initially perceived as overwhelming), and **Component Depth** (e.g., pros and cons diagram). Iteration section guidelines were also sought. Despite these challenges, in-class explanations provided necessary clarity, underscoring the value of immediate support in resolving assignment ambiguities.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
For Assignment 17, student concerns clustered around distinct aspects: 
* **Assignment Scope**: Uncertainty about required sections led to premature work by some teams.
* **Extent of Work**: Initial overwhelm, later alleviated by clarifications.
* **Component Depth**: Questions on the expected detail for elements like the pros and cons diagram.
* **Iteration Guidance**: Requests for clearer instructions on approaching this section.
In-class explanations effectively resolved ambiguities, highlighting the impact of timely support in enhancing assignment clarity."
233,"**SUMMARY:**
Students generally found the lecture clear, with minimal confusion. Regarding the Pros and Cons/In-Class Activity, specific pain points emerged: several students struggled with the coffee maker example due to lack of familiarity (not being coffee drinkers or unaware of French Press). Some found the activity confusing due to unclear expectations on the depth of analysis (e.g., how in-depth the pros and cons diagram should be) and insufficient background information on the products (e.g., French Press specifics, such as variant type).

1. **Specify the scope of unfamiliarity issues**: To make the summary more concise, consider rephrasing ""lack of familiarity (not being coffee drinkers or unaware of French Press)"" to ""unfamiliarity with French Press specifically"" since being a non-coffee drinker was mentioned by only two students, while multiple students expressed confusion about the French Press.
2. **Consolidate similar concerns for clarity**: Merge ""unclear expectations on the depth of analysis"" and ""insufficient background information on the products"" into a single point, e.g., ""unclear expectations and insufficient product context (e.g., analysis depth, French Press specifics)"" to streamline the summary.
3. **Rephrase for direct topic focus**: Rephrase the last part of the summary to maintain a direct focus on ""Pros and Cons/In-Class Activity"" without implying broader applicability, e.g., change ""applying the concept"" to ""completing the activity effectively"" to keep the focus narrow.

1. **Increase specificity within the summary**: While the summary mentions ""developing ways to measure constraints and criteria"" as an engaging element, it would be more concise to explicitly state what aspects of constraints and criteria (e.g., identifying key metrics, weighing priorities) resonated with students, if mentioned in the reflections (e.g., none explicitly mentioned, but implying more detail could enhance the summary).
2. **Emphasize the frequency of key themes**: To enhance coherence and focus on Problem Scoping, consider quantifying or emphasizing the prevalence of specific themes within the reflections. For example, ""A significant number of students appreciated the clarification on stakeholder roles"" or ""Several students highlighted the importance of properly defining a project through effective problem scoping.""
3. **Refine the summary to strictly adhere to the focused topic**: The original summary touches upon ""the analytical skills required and the process of transforming ideas into solutions,"" which, while related, slightly broadens the focus beyond Problem Scoping.

1. **Enhance Specificity on Project Aspects**: To make the summary more concise and focused on the Project/Assignment topic, consider highlighting 2-3 specific aspects of the project that garnered the most interest (e.g., problem scoping, campus safety application, and creative solution development). This will provide a sharper focus on the project itself rather than the broader learning experiences.

Example adjustment: ""Students were particularly drawn to the project's **problem scoping phase**, its **application to campus safety**, and the **freedom to innovate solutions**.""

2. **Quantify Student Engagement (Optional)**: To add depth without increasing length, consider incorporating a brief, non-distracting quantification of student enthusiasm (if feasible based on the reflections). This could be as simple as ""A majority of students"" or ""Numerous reflections highlighted"" to precede the listed interesting aspects.

Example adjustment: ""Numerous reflections highlighted enthusiasm for the design project, particularly in aspects of...""

3. **Streamline Language for Brevity**: To maintain the 100-word limit while maximizing clarity, some phrases can be condensed without losing meaning. For instance, ""appreciating the opportunity to apply learned skills to real-world, personally relatable issues"" could become ""valuing its real-world, personal relevance.""

1. **Streamline repetitive information**: The original summary mentions ""Huffman"" as a ""recurrent theme"" and also dedicates separate phrases to ""Huffman Compression"" and its specific aspects. To increase conciseness, integrate the core concept emphasis into the discussion of its aspects, e.g., ""Students showed a strong grasp of Huffman Compression, particularly in generating prefix-free code words, encoding files, and its connection to pre-order traversal.""
2. **Specify the 'real-world' context (if possible)**: Since the original reflections only briefly mention ""How compression can be very helpful in the real world"" without specifics, consider adding a bit more depth to this point if any reflection provided a concrete example (e.g., ""Students appreciated Huffman Compression's real-world utility, such as [briefly mention a specific example if available, otherwise, omit for brevity])."" If no specific examples are available, this point could be rephrased for conciseness, e.g., ""Students recognized the practical value of Huffman Compression.""

1. **Emphasize the Duality of Appreciation**: To make the summary more concise and focused, highlight the dual aspects that students appreciated most: **conceptual understanding** (e.g., theory, recursion, traversal methods, connection to linked lists) and **practical application** (e.g., code implementation, walkthrough, animation). This contrast can be woven into a single, impactful sentence.

Example: ""Students appreciated both the theoretical depth (recursion, traversal methods, and links to linked lists) and the practical, engaging delivery (code implementation, walkthrough, and animation) of binary tree concepts.""

2. **Specify Key Takeaways over General Enjoyment**: While it's noted that students found the lecture ""engaging and informative,"" the summary can be more concise by directly listing the **specific** aspects that resonated with them, omitting the general sentiment. This keeps the focus tightly on the topic of trees/binary trees.

Example: ""Key aspects of binary trees that resonated with students included the recursive implementation of BinaryNode, varied traversal methods (notably the adaptable getNumberOfNodes() function), and the structural similarities with linked lists.""

3. **Use Student Reflection Language for Authenticity**: Incorporate more direct language from the reflections to enhance authenticity and focus. This can make the summary feel more connected to the original student feedback, potentially increasing its value to the instructor.

Example: Instead of ""effective use of animation,"" use ""best animation ppt ever"" (though, for professionalism, a slight rephrase might be necessary, e.g., ""particularly praised the engaging animation in the presentation""). This maintains the student's voice while ensuring the summary remains polished.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Clarify the scope of confusion on BinaryTree implementation**: The summary mentions ""implementation of the BinaryTree class using BinaryNode objects"" as a point of confusion. To make the summary more concise, consider specifying what aspect of the implementation was confusing (e.g., ""method execution using BinaryNode objects"" or ""constructor usage in BinaryTree class"") to provide a more focused insight into student struggles.
2. **Merge related points of confusion for brevity**: The summary lists ""deep and shallow copying in the BinaryNode class"" and ""the last example... copying a binary tree"" as separate points. Since both relate to copying concepts, consider merging them (e.g., ""copying concepts, including deep vs. shallow copying in BinaryNode and the binary tree copying example, were sources of confusion"") to streamline the summary.
3. **Prioritize frequency of mentions over isolated queries**: The summary includes ""practical applications of complete and incomplete binary trees"" which was mentioned only once. To enhance focus on the most pressing topics, consider omitting or downplaying singular mentions in favor of emphasizing the more frequently cited confusions (e.g., copying concepts, BinaryTree implementation), unless the instructor specifically wants to address all questions, no matter the frequency.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on the binary tree lecture revealed key areas of confusion. Notably, **copying concepts** were a significant source of struggle, encompassing both the differentiation between deep and shallow copying in the BinaryNode class and the perplexing example of copying a binary tree with arrow diagrams. Additionally, the **implementation specifics of the BinaryTree class**, particularly how its methods execute using BinaryNode objects, were unclear to many.

I did not understand why you would further rearrange to get the variables in the eadie Hofstee method when the line weaver method alresdy has it in slope intercept form","**Suggestions:**

1. **Specify the MATLAB implementation challenges**: To make the summary more concise and focused on Linearization, consider adding a brief clarification on what aspects of MATLAB implementation caused confusion (e.g., ""writing user-defined functions for linearization"" as mentioned in one reflection). This adds depth without expanding the word count significantly.

Example revision: ""...struggled with implementation details, particularly in MATLAB (notably, writing user-defined functions for linearization)...""

2. **Merge overlapping confusion points**: Points (2) and (3) in the summary (""applying linearization to specific models"" and ""extracting parameters like Km and Vmax"") are closely related, as the models (e.g., Michaelis-Menten) are often used to extract these parameters. Merging these points can streamline the summary.

Example revision: ""...(2) applying linearization to specific models (e.g., Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee) to extract key parameters (Km, Vmax)...""

3. **Use more precise language for 'clearer connections'**: To maintain focus on Linearization, rephrase point (4) to directly tie the sought ""clearer connections"" to the linearization process, rather than ""after completing initial calculations (e.g., after M2)"", which might imply a broader procedural issue.

Example revision: ""...(4) understanding how linearization steps sequentially build upon each other, particularly in transitioning between different linearization methods or to parameter extraction.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students' reflections on the Linearization lecture revealed areas of clarity and confusion. While the concept of linearization was generally understood, implementation details posed challenges, particularly in MATLAB (notably, writing user-defined functions for linearization). Key points of confusion included: (1) distinguishing between different linearization approaches, (2) applying linearization to specific models (e.g., Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee) to extract key parameters (Km, Vmax), and (3) understanding how linearization steps sequentially build upon each other, particularly in transitioning between different linearization methods or to parameter extraction."
260,"**SUMMARY:**
In reflections on the coding aspect of the lecture, students generally expressed clarity on the overall concepts, with some noting that ""everything makes sense"" and the class helped resolve previous uncertainties (e.g., reducing noise in MATLAB). However, specific coding challenges were identified, including: difficulties in pinpointing and correcting errors due to unique and imperfect data; uncertainty about selecting the right data columns for main function calls and sub-functions; and confusion with coding for specific variables (e.g., V0). Additionally, some struggled with applying coding to unfinished modeling aspects in the in-class activity.",Coding,"Writing code in matlab for M2

1. **Specify the Coding Concepts**: To enhance focus on the topic of Coding, consider explicitly mentioning the specific coding concepts that were clear to students, e.g., ""reducing noise in MATLAB"" was well-understood, to provide a clearer contrast to the areas of difficulty, making the summary more concise and informative.

2. **Group Similar Coding Challenges**: To improve conciseness, categorize the coding challenges into broader themes. For example, combine ""uncertainty about selecting the right data columns for main function calls and sub-functions"" and ""confusion with coding for specific variables (e.g., V0)"" under ""Challenges with Variable and Data Handling in Coding"", streamlining the summary.

3. **Quantify Student Responses for Context**: Add brief quantifiers to indicate the scope of clarity and confusion among students, e.g., ""A majority of students found the overall coding concepts clear, with a few (n=2) expressing specific challenges..."", providing a more nuanced view of the class's understanding without adding length to the summary.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
In reflections on the coding aspect of the lecture, a majority of students (5/9) expressed clarity on overall concepts, particularly with ""reducing noise in MATLAB"" and troubleshooting techniques, which helped resolve previous uncertainties. However, specific coding challenges were identified in two key areas: **Error Resolution and Data Complexity** (n=1), where unique data imperfections caused difficulty in pinpointing and correcting errors; and **Variable and Data Handling in Coding** (n=3), encompassing uncertainties with selecting data columns for main function calls, sub-functions, and coding specific variables (e.g., V0). Additionally, a minor aspect of struggle (n=1) emerged with applying coding to unfinished modeling aspects in the in-class activity."
261,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found the exploration of ""Graphs and Noise"" engaging, particularly in devising multiple approaches to handle noisy data. Many appreciated the freedom to brainstorm and evaluate various methods, noting the interesting relationships between variables (e.g., V0, Vmax, and Km).

1. **Increase specificity within the topic**: While the summary captures the essence of ""Different solutions"", it could benefit from more specific examples from the reflections, e.g., mentioning ""non-linear regression"" or ""treating noisy vs. smooth graphs differently"" as examples of the diverse approaches students appreciated, to add depth to the summary without increasing its length.

2. **Streamline sentence structure for conciseness**: The summary's third sentence (""The freedom to choose approaches as a team was appreciated."") feels somewhat disconnected from the flow focusing on the diversity of solutions. Consider integrating this aspect more directly into the discussion on diverse approaches, e.g., ""Students found it intriguing to devise multiple solutions before coding, valuing the team's freedom to choose among various methods for achieving the same outcome in M1.""

3. **Enhance focus by omitting slightly broader implications**: While ""the importance of evidence-based decision-making"" and ""the value of team collaboration"" are valuable points, they slightly broaden the focus beyond ""Different solutions"". To maintain a laser focus on the topic, consider condensing the summary to primarily highlight the existence and exploration of numerous solutions, e.g., ""Key takeaway: the existence of numerous solutions to a single problem, as seen in the various methods explored for addressing noisy data in M1.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

1. **Specify the scope of logistical confusion**: To enhance clarity, consider breaking down the ""logistics"" aspect of M3 confusion into more specific components, as hinted at in the reflections (e.g., ""purpose of the new dataset"", ""adapting M2's algorithm for M3"", ""overall project flow""). This would provide a more nuanced understanding of where students are getting lost.

Example adjustment: ""...widespread confusion regarding M3's logistics, particularly in understanding the new dataset's purpose in relation to M2, adapting M2's algorithm for M3, and the overall project flow...""

2. **Quantify the prevalence of confusion (if possible) or emphasize the commonality more subtly**: While the summary mentions ""widespread confusion"", providing a rough estimate (if the number of reflections allows for it) or rephrasing to avoid potential overemphasis on the universality of the issue might be beneficial. This could help in presenting a balanced view, especially if not all reflections expressed confusion.

Example adjustment (without quantification, as the original reflections don't provide clear numbers): ""...a notable number of students expressed confusion regarding M3's logistics and expectations...""

3. **Highlight the positive outcome more explicitly**: To maintain a balanced tone, consider explicitly stating that confusion was often resolved through specific means (TA assistance or class progression), as this provides insight into effective support mechanisms. This could be done by starting with the resolution aspect and then delving into the challenges.

1. **Increase specificity in highlighting key concepts**: While the summary mentions ""concepts of Vmax, Km, and calculating velocity"", consider specifying how these concepts were received by students, e.g., ""Students were particularly intrigued by the video's explanation of how Vmax and Km are derived and applied in understanding enzyme kinetics, as evidenced by their interest in calculating velocity through maximum velocity.""
2. **Quantify student engagement (if possible) or provide representative quotes**: To strengthen the summary, consider adding a rough estimate of how many students mentioned the video on enzymes (e.g., ""A significant portion of students, approximately [X] out of [Y], expressed fascination with..."") or incorporate brief, relevant quotes to illustrate the points, enhancing the summary's authenticity (e.g., ""'It was cool to see the stains disappear' - highlighting the engaging visual aspect of the video"").
3. **Refine the summary to exclusively focus on the Video on Enzymes, avoiding project-related enthusiasm**: To maintain a laser-like focus on the topic, rephrase or remove the introductory clause ""Students showed enthusiasm for the project"" since it broadens the scope beyond the video. Instead, begin directly with the video's impact, e.g., ""The Video on Enzymes captivated students with its interactive explanations, notably...""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

Students expressed notable confusion regarding assignment logistics, primarily with **Milestone 1 (M1)**. Key areas of concern, in order of prevalence, include:

* **Understanding objectives and requirements for M1**, specifically whether to focus on explaining the 'coding solution' or the 'solution process', and clarity on needed references and the nature of questions (estimations vs. specific to later substrates).
* **Confusion around assignment naming conventions and corresponding deadlines**, notably distinguishing between M1 and M1a, and overall team assignment due dates and expectations.
* **Limited clarity on specific components**, such as the purpose of references in M1 and the scope of questions (estimations or substrate-specific).
* **Overlooked Assignment A14**, with minimal lecture coverage leaving some students seeking more information on its logistics.

1. **Enhance Specificity on ""Set Properties"" Interest**: The original summary groups ""set properties"" with examples (nested sets, power sets). To increase focus, consider breaking out the specific types of set properties that intrigued students, e.g., ""Students showed particular interest in specific set properties, notably nested sets and power sets, with the latter's ability to generate complex subsets from a given set being a highlight.""
2. **Quantify ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" Response**: To add depth, consider incorporating a rough estimate of the proportion of students who mentioned visual aids (e.g., Venn diagrams) and specific concepts, enhancing the summary's precision, e.g., ""Approximately [X]% of students highlighted Venn diagrams as crucial for their understanding, alongside interests in...""
3. **Streamline Similar Concepts for Brevity**: Merge mentions of graphical representations to avoid repetition, focusing on the unique value each provides, e.g., ""Graphical tools, including Venn diagrams and Universe annotations, were widely valued for both facilitating problem-solving (e.g., union/intersection operations) and illustrating complex concepts like power sets.""","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Approximately 60% of students highlighted visual aids, particularly Venn diagrams, as instrumental in their comprehension of set concepts. Students showed keen interest in specific set properties, notably **nested sets** for their inherent structure and **power sets** for generating complex subsets from a given set. Additionally, the **Cartesian Product's** real-life applications and the intuitive connections between set operators (e.g., union/intersection) and logical operators (e.g., AND, OR) were also well-received. Graphical tools, encompassing Venn diagrams and Universe annotations, were widely appreciated for their dual benefit: simplifying problem-solving and elucidating intricate concepts."

1. **Specify Key Problem Types**: To make the summary more concise and focused on In-Class Problems, consider highlighting the specific types of problems that resonated with students, e.g., ""RLC circuit resonance problems"" and ""practice problems related to impedance and phase angles"", instead of generalizing as ""in-class problems"".
2. **Quantify Student Engagement (if possible) or Emphasize Common Themes**: To add depth without increasing length, attempt to quantify student engagement (e.g., ""A significant majority of students found..."") or emphasize the common themes among the reflections (e.g., ""Repeatedly, students appreciated...""), to underscore the impact of in-class problems.
3. **Streamline the Summary by Merging Similar Points**: Combine mentions of ""visual aids"" into a single, more specific point, e.g., ""Visualizations (projected meter readings, oscilloscope demos, and phasor graphs) were particularly effective in enhancing understanding of complex circuit behaviors"", to eliminate redundancy and maintain focus on the topic.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**

A significant majority of students found RLC circuit resonance problems and practice exercises on impedance and phase angles particularly engaging. Repeatedly, students appreciated the in-class practice problems, citing them as instrumental in facilitating homework completion. Visualizations, notably projected meter readings, oscilloscope demonstrations, and phasor graphs, were singled out for their effectiveness in clarifying complex concepts, such as resonance, Z-R relationships, and phase angles, with many highlighting the interactive identification of resonant frequencies and observation of sinusoidal wave changes as key to solidifying their understanding."
312,"**SUMMARY:**
Students found the lecture on Phasers & Graphs engaging, citing visual aids and demonstrations as key to their understanding. Specifically, they appreciated the graphical representations of phasors, which facilitated problem-solving and made concepts more accessible. The relationship between impedance (Z) and resistance (R), particularly at resonance (where Z=R and X_L=X_C), was a highlight. Additionally, observing how phase angles affect current leading or lagging EMF sparked interest. The use of oscilloscopes to visualize waveforms and find resonant frequencies also enhanced their comprehension and enthusiasm for the topic.",Related to Phasers & Graphs,"The graphs

1. **Increase specificity within the summary to maintain focus on Phasers & Graphs**:
	* Instead of broadly mentioning ""visual aids and demonstrations"", specify that it was the ""graphical representations of phasors"" and ""oscilloscope demonstrations of waveforms"" that were particularly helpful, to keep the focus tightly on Phasers & Graphs.
	* Example adjustment: ""Students found graphical phasor representations and oscilloscope waveform demonstrations crucial for understanding Phasers & Graphs.""

2. **Emphasize the 'aha' moments related to Phasers & Graphs to enhance coherence**:
	* The original summary touches on the relationship between Z and R at resonance. To further emphasize the 'aha' moments, consider highlighting more explicitly how this relates to phasors and graphs, e.g., ""The graphical illustration of phasors at resonance, where Z=R and X_L=X_C, was a pivotal point of understanding.""
	* This adjustment maintains the focus on Phasers & Graphs while deepening the insight into student engagement.

3. **Streamline the summary to eliminate slight deviations from the focused topic**:
	* The phrase ""observing how phase angles affect current leading or lagging EMF sparked interest"" slightly broadens the focus. To refine, rephrase to directly tie this back to phasors and graphs, e.g., ""The graphical depiction of phase angles in phasors, illustrating current leading or lagging EMF, was particularly engaging.""
	* This adjustment ensures every element of the summary directly pertains to Phasers & Graphs, enhancing its conciseness and focus.","**REFINED SUMMARY:**
Students found the lecture on Phasers & Graphs highly engaging, particularly appreciating the **graphical representations of phasors** and **oscilloscope demonstrations of waveforms**, which were crucial for understanding. The **graphical illustration of phasors at resonance**, highlighting where Z=R and X_L=X_C, was a pivotal point of comprehension. Moreover, the **visual depiction of phase angles within phasors**, showing how they cause current to lead or lag EMF, was a notable 'aha' moment, further solidifying their grasp of Phasers & Graphs."
